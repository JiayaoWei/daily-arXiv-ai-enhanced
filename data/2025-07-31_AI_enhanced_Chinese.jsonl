This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models.

More\nprototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the\nactivation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn\nrich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer\nsupport for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528-\u5efa\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\uff08UCx\uff09\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301UCx\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790Pythia-1.4B\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u53cc\u5bbe\u8bed\u548c\u4ecb\u8bcd\u5bbe\u8bed\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285000\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u80fd\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cJensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u968f\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u66f4\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u66f4\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5efa\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u539f\u5219\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002"}}

This development happens in parallel with a growing demand\nof data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient\noptimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously\nestablished as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In\nparallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an\nobjective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level.

Numerous outages occur each year,\nexacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data\nare typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution\nand making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers\nexcellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image\ndata provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more\ncomprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing\nthe geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.\nHowever, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating\nspatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge\nrepresentation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and\npredictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal\nknowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light\nsatellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and\ncounty-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for\nconstructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,\nGeoOutageOnto.

However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant\non historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,\noptimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.\nThis log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical\npreferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests.

By integrating large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,\nand explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into\nan intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the\nabove domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a\nmulti-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced\npre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative\njudge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.\nOnline experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance\ngains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and\nsatisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.\nThese comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that\nLLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually\nbeneficial recommendation ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRecGPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u5171\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65e5\u5fd7\u62df\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u7a84\u5316\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "RecGPT\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5316\uff09\u5c06LLM\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u6316\u6398\u3001\u7269\u54c1\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9dApp\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRecGPT\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5546\u5bb6\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u4e92\u5229\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To\nbe specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease\ndimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for\neffective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve\ngeneralization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to\napply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in\nextracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.\nFurthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features\nfurther improves the accuracy.

However, their robustness against\nadversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to\nsystem reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable\nlimitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only\nperturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework\nthat adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary\ngeneration. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop\nuser-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned\nperturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a\npre-trained VAE within the diffusion model.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries.

Our approach introduces two key innovations.\nFirst, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,\nour method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\\ell_1$\nregularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor\nplacements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an\nadaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nregularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while\npreserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.\n  We validate $\\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including\nviscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface\ntemperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the\ntraditional $\\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves\nsignificantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM\nand PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby\nproviding superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased\nrobustness against noise and outliers.\n  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED\ndesign architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing\nthe temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the\nhigh-dimensional state space.

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization.

Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of\nmodels and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of\npolitical biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.\nMoreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.\n  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political\norientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven\nmodels, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using\nthe Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per\nstatement to ensure robust measurement.

Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.PL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers\nachieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\\times$ to 4.8$\\times$ compared to\nusing widely-used initial seeds.

Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and\nreusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an\nensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and\nreusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only\nperforms direct generation.

However, unaligned samples across different parties in\nVFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature\nrepresentation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,\nclass-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and\ninter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and\nfeature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual\nprototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn\nrelationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to\npredict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype\nlearning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal\ntransport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided\nmodule guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior\nprobabilities. Finally, we adopt an \\textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation\nstrategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically\nweighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved\nthat Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a\nconvergence rate of 1/\\sqrt T.

The framework\nemploys a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents\ncollaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive\nlearning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further\npresent a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent\nsystems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.\nOur paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,\naddressing fairness concerns.

While many methods compress neural network\nparameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To\naddress this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)\nframework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian\nfunction to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the\ncomputational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we\nintroduce Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the\nfractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each\nkernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional\nGaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured\nPruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios.

However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are\noften constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant\nchallenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although\nincorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial\ndomain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner\nhardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain\ntransferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain\nAdaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA\nleverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with\neach branch comprising an encoder and a classifier.

Existing vulnerability\ndetection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle\nwith complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models\nperform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.\nIn contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate\nimpressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they\noften underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on\nspecialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,\ncontributing to improved detection performance.\n  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for\nsmart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to\nguide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which\nserve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to\nprocess contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To\ncombine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive\nMixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a\nGating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and\nSoftmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism\nto enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective\nintegration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through\ngradient optimization.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local\nAlignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),\nwe achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level\nmemory and the semantic representations in high-level memory.

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and\nhigh-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our\nmethod suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive\nevaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask\nsequence.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety.

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds.

Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a\ndomain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable\nof ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an\nimplementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which\ncan be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation\ncapabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention.

In response, we developed a system\nconsisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation\nonline.

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair.
