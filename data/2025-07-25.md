### [1] [Shop-R1: Rewarding LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior in Online Shopping via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17842)
*Yimeng Zhang,Tian Wang,Jiri Gesi,Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Jiacheng Lin,Sinong Zhan,Vianne Gao,Ruochen Jiao,Junze Liu,Kun Qian,Yuxin Tang,Ran Xue,Houyu Zhang,Qingjun Cui,Yufan Guo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1是一个新的强化学习框架，通过分解人类行为模拟任务为两个阶段（理由生成和动作预测），并利用自监督和分层奖励结构，显著提升了LLM在在线购物环境中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于LLM生成的理性数据，但其性能受限于模型的推理能力。Shop-R1旨在通过强化学习框架突破这一限制。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和动作预测两个阶段，分别采用自监督信号和分层奖励结构进行优化。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线有超过65%的相对提升。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过创新的强化学习设计，显著提升了LLM在模拟人类行为中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [2] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DG-PRM提出了一种动态且可泛化的过程奖励建模方法，通过奖励树和多维奖励标准提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，跨领域泛化能力不足，且静态评估标准难以适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度奖励标准，动态选择奖励信号，并首次使用Pareto优势估计处理多维信号。

Result: 实验显示DG-PRM在基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM通过动态奖励建模和泛化能力，为复杂任务中的LLM提供了有效的指导。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

### [3] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，用于检测和减轻自然语言数据库接口中的认知偏差，通过语义映射、分析框架和优化LLM提示生成，显著提升分析质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助缺乏统计背景的用户在自然语言数据库接口中避免认知偏差，提升分析问题的质量。

Method: 引入上下文语义映射框架、基于Hard-to-Vary原则的分析框架，以及优化的LLM提示生成系统。

Result: 用户测试显示82.5%参与者认可其分析质量提升，VeriMinder在具体性、全面性和准确性上优于其他方法至少20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder有效解决了“错误问题”漏洞，其开源代码和框架为社区研究和采用提供了支持。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

### [4] [One Whisper to Grade Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17918)
*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效端到端的自动口语评估方法，使用单一Whisper-small编码器处理多部分测试，减少推理时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多部分第二语言测试的自动口语评估问题，提升计算机辅助语言学习系统的实用性。

Method: 使用Whisper-small编码器处理所有口语响应，通过轻量级聚合器整合信息并预测最终分数，无需转录和分部分模型。

Result: 系统RMSE为0.384，优于文本基线（0.44），参数仅为Whisper-small的70%，数据采样策略仅需44.8%的说话人数据即可达到0.383 RMSE。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且数据利用率高，适用于大规模语言学习系统。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了六种AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，发现对抗攻击（如改写和人化）显著降低了检测器的准确性，而Few-shot和CoT提示方法表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补文献中关于DeepSeek这一新LLM的检测空白，评估现有AI检测工具在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用六种AI检测工具测试DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，并应用改写和人化等对抗攻击。同时，采用Few-shot和CoT提示方法评估DeepSeek作为检测器的性能。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始和改写文本上表现优异，而人化攻击显著降低了所有检测器的准确性。Few-shot和CoT提示方法表现出高准确率。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击（尤其是人化）显著影响检测器性能，Few-shot和CoT提示方法为AI检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

*Sohaib Imran,Ihor Kendiukhov,Matthew Broerman,Aditya Thomas,Riccardo Campanella,Rob Lamb,Peter M. Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨更大、更强大的语言模型是否能在上下文中根据证据更一致地更新其“信念”，并提出贝叶斯一致性系数（BCC）进行测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证语言模型是否遵循贝叶斯定理更新信念，以理解其推理能力。

Method: 提出BCC指标并生成数据集，测量多个预训练语言模型的BCC值，与参数数量、训练数据及基准测试分数对比。

Result: 更大、更强大的预训练语言模型的信念更新更符合贝叶斯定理。

Conclusion: 研究结果对理解和治理大型语言模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models
such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2},
\textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1}, including post-trained versions with 35B
and 115B parameters, to empower developers and researchers with

### [9] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB提出了一种非线性门控检索模块的框架，用于高效编辑大语言模型中的知识，同时保持其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有线性Locate-and-Edit方法在编辑大规模事实时可能损害模型通用能力或导致遗忘的问题。

Method: 将线性L&E方法建模为KV数据库查询，提出NeuralDB框架，通过非线性门控模块仅在涉及编辑事实时操作。

Result: 在10,000事实编辑实验中表现优异，编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性均优于基线，且不影响模型在六项任务中的表现。

Conclusion: NeuralDB在编辑大规模知识时高效且不影响模型通用能力，可扩展到100,000事实。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [10] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键输入标记并构建方向性引导向量，优化语言和视觉语言模型的行为，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定的全局干预向量，忽视输入标记的因果影响和梯度信息，尤其在多模态任务中表现不足。

Method: GrAInS利用对比梯度归因识别关键标记，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活。

Result: GrAInS在TruthfulQA、MMHal-Bench和SPA-VL等任务中显著优于微调和现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GrAInS实现了细粒度、可解释的模型行为控制，同时保持了模型的流畅性和通用能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

*Hoyeon Lee,Sejung Son,Ye-Eun Kang,Jong-Hwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，减少人工标注需求，解决语音领域的数据挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语断句预测方法依赖大量人工标注，成本高且数据一致性差，LLM在NLP中已证明可生成合成数据，因此探索其在语音领域的应用。

Method: 利用LLM生成合成短语断句标注，与传统标注对比，并评估其在多语言中的有效性。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据有效缓解了短语断句预测的数据挑战，展示了LLM在语音领域的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM为语音领域提供了一种可行的数据解决方案，减少了人工标注需求。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM生成合成数据的多样性和隐私问题，提出了评估指标和改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽成本低且可扩展，但其多样性和隐私风险尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一套评估多样性和隐私的指标，并通过实验验证了LLM生成数据的局限性，最后提出基于提示的方法改进。

Result: 实验显示LLM生成的合成数据在多样性和隐私保护方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 基于提示的方法能有效提升合成数据的多样性并保护隐私。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注SLMs是否能完成复杂任务，而忽略了用户自然对话场景的需求。

Method: TELEVAL定义了三个评估维度：显式语义、副语言和隐式语义以及系统能力，采用对话格式分别评估文本和音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，现有SLMs在自然对话任务中仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL可作为用户中心的评估框架，推动面向对话的SLMs发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

### [14] [Hybrid and Unitary Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models: Methods and Benchmarking under Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18076)
*Haomin Qi,Zihan Dai,Chengbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，结合BOFT的正交稳定性和LoRA-GA的快速收敛，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的微调效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的规模和内存需求，其微调仍然是一个计算瓶颈。本文旨在通过参数高效微调技术解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种混合策略，动态结合BOFT的正交稳定性和LoRA-GA的梯度对齐快速收敛，并首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLM。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，混合方法在收敛效率和泛化能力上优于其他PEFT基线，接近全微调的准确性，同时减少了训练时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限环境下LLM的实际部署提供了实用且可扩展的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

TL;DR: 2024年新版GloVe模型通过更新数据源和预处理方法，改进了2014年模型的不足，并在词汇、结构和NER任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014年的GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但数据版本和预处理方法未充分记录，且语言和世界的变化需要更新的模型。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练了两组词嵌入，并通过词汇比较、直接测试和NER任务进行评估。

Result: 2024年模型包含新文化词汇，结构任务表现相当，并在非西方新闻数据等时间依赖的NER任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 新版GloVe模型在语言和文化适应性上有所提升，适用于现代应用。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一种新型的端到端口语语言模型，通过解耦语言建模和声学实现，增强了非语义信息的处理能力，如情感、方言和年龄特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语语言模型主要关注语言内容，忽视了语音中的副语言和说话者特征信息（如情感、方言等），限制了模型的自然交互能力。

Method: 采用双模态头部架构，解耦语言建模与声学实现；提出模块化分阶段训练策略，逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL基准测试中，GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应和社交意识的口语系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的表现，重点关注代码生成和编辑能力，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍显著落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE），并利用涵盖五种数学图形的数据集对九种主流MLLMs进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLMs在代码驱动多模态推理能力评估上的空白，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在HIV管理中的能力，开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，并发现Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但复杂问题下性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理的复杂性使其成为LLMs应用的理想场景，但临床实践中对准确性、潜在危害和接受度的担忧尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，评估了7个通用和3个医学专用LLMs，结合了词汇相似性和LLM-as-a-judge方法。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但性能随问题复杂度下降；医学微调模型未必优于通用模型；推理和理解能力较弱。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估，以确保LLMs在临床中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer文本嵌入模型中存在‘粘性标记’，这些标记会破坏嵌入距离的正常分布，影响下游任务性能。论文提出了一种检测方法STD，并在多个模型中发现了868个粘性标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粘性标记的存在破坏了嵌入模型的可靠性，影响下游任务性能，因此需要系统研究其成因和影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于句子和标记过滤的检测方法STD，并在40个模型检查点中应用。

Result: 发现了868个粘性标记，其来源包括特殊词汇、未使用条目和多语言子词片段。这些标记显著降低了聚类和检索任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了粘性标记的问题，呼吁改进标记化策略和模型设计以减少其影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过消除选项位置偏差和语义邻近干扰，提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在多选题任务中可能通过利用选项位置或标签的固有偏差来获得虚高分数，而非真正理解。

Method: SCOPE通过重复调用无语义内容的空提示，估计模型的独特位置偏差分布，并基于逆偏差分布重新分配答案位置，同时避免语义相似的干扰项相邻。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE在稳定性能提升和更清晰的置信度分布方面优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提升LLM评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,

introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI

TL;DR: GMTP是一种基于梯度的防御方法，通过检测和过滤恶意文档来保护RAG模型免受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG依赖外部知识库可能被攻击者注入有毒文档，导致误导性输出，因此需要一种防御机制。

Method: GMTP通过分析检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，并使用掩码语言模型检测低概率令牌以过滤恶意文档。

Result: 实验显示GMTP能过滤90%以上的有毒内容，同时保留相关文档，保持模型性能。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种高效且精确的防御方法，适用于多种对抗场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令调优提升大语言模型（LLM）遵循用户指令的能力，但可能增加对用户输入的依赖，导致更容易接受错误信息。研究发现，指令调优后的模型更易受用户提供的错误信息影响，需系统性方法减轻其负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令调优对LLM接受错误信息的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 比较指令调优模型与基础模型对错误信息的接受程度，分析用户角色、提示结构等因素的影响。

Result: 指令调优显著增加模型对用户提供错误信息的接受度，且用户角色和提示结构等因素进一步影响其易感性。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法减轻指令调优的负面影响，提升LLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪除层会导致隐藏状态幅度差距，引起性能下降，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp，通过离线重新缩放剩余权重补偿幅度差距，无需训练。

Result: 剪除5层LLaMA-3-8B时，困惑度减半，保留93.19%问答性能，优于基线4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp有效提升层剪枝性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Motivation: 当前直接语音翻译（ST）中术语翻译准确性不足，现有方法难以充分利用翻译知识且易受噪声干扰。

Method: 提出Locate-and-Focus方法：1）定位术语片段以构建翻译知识；2）关联音频和文本模态信息，优化翻译过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效定位术语并提升翻译成功率，同时保持通用翻译性能。

Conclusion: Locate-and-Focus方法显著提升了术语翻译效果，为ST领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（LRL）使用独特脚本时的OCR问题，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 比较六种OCR引擎（包括商业和开源系统）在Sinhala和Tamil上的零样本性能，使用五种测量技术评估字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上表现最佳（WER 2.61%），Document AI在Tamil上表现最优（CER 0.78%）。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的OCR性能提供了基准，并提出了新的合成数据集，有助于未来研究。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通信中需要LLMs适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库难以实现这一目标。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器在基础模型上训练多样化的非结构化风格语料库，然后与指令跟随模型合并。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持指令遵循的同时提高了风格一致性，人类评估确认了品牌特定惯例的采纳。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs的风格个性化提供了一种高效路径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨机器翻译模型在性别标记不明确时的表现，以及去偏方法对翻译行为的影响。

Method: 使用语义不确定性度量方法，分析模型在性别明确和模糊情况下的翻译行为。

Result: 模型在性别明确时表现良好，但在模糊情况下未能表现出足够的不确定性；去偏方法对明确和模糊情况的影响不同。

Conclusion: 机器翻译模型需改进以在性别模糊时表现不确定性，去偏方法需针对不同情况优化。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，通过解耦不同任务的ICL示例并利用LLM的细粒度反馈来提升检索模块性能，从而在多任务数据集中检索高质量示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果依赖于示例质量，但现有方法在区分跨任务数据分布和连接检索器输出与LLM反馈方面存在挑战。

Method: TDR框架解耦不同任务的ICL示例，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈指导检索模块训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR在所有数据集上均提升了性能，并达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松与多种LLM结合，提升ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类专家和大语言模型（LLM）的新框架，用于提高社交媒体上宣传检测的标注一致性和可扩展性。通过分层分类法和LLM辅助预标注，显著提升了标注效率和小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的宣传检测任务复杂且高质量标注数据有限，亟需一种既能保证标注一致性又能提高可扩展性的方法。

Method: 提出分层分类法组织14种细粒度宣传技术；利用LLM辅助预标注生成标注和解释；通过知识蒸馏训练小模型。

Result: LLM辅助预标注显著提高了标注一致性和时间效率；小模型在LLM生成数据上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了支持，符合SDG 16的目标。代码已开源。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR是一个交互式开源工具，用于分析LLM的错误，提供详细的反馈和可视化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估仅提供单一评分或排名，缺乏具体行为分析，CLEAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CLEAR生成实例级反馈，识别系统级错误问题，并通过交互式仪表板进行可视化分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和数学基准测试中展示了其分析能力，并通过用户案例验证了实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR为LLM评估提供了更深入、可操作的分析工具。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Motivation: 维基百科多语言版本独立编写和更新导致事实不一致，影响其中立性和可靠性，尤其是对依赖其训练的AI系统。

Method: 开发了一种方法，收集、对齐和分析多语言维基百科文章中的表格数据，并定义了不一致的类别。

Result: 通过定量和定性指标评估了多语言对齐情况，揭示了不一致性的具体表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果对事实验证、多语言知识交互以及设计可靠的AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

TL;DR: FinDPO是一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的金融领域专用LLM框架，显著提升了情感分析性能，并在实际投资策略中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融文本的情感分析对交易决策和市场动态影响深远，但传统监督微调（SFT）方法存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出FinDPO框架，通过DPO进行后训练人类偏好对齐，并设计‘logit-to-score’转换方法生成连续情感分数。

Result: FinDPO在标准情感分类任务中平均性能提升11%，模拟投资策略年回报率达67%，夏普比率2.0。

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个在实际交易成本下仍能保持高回报和风险调整性能的情感分析方法。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

TL;DR: 论文提出了AraTable，一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯语表格数据上推理和理解能力的综合基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语表格数据在LLMs中表现不足的问题，填补公开资源和语言特性的空白。

Method: 采用混合方法，由LLMs生成初始内容，再由人类专家过滤和验证，确保数据集质量。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）表现尚可，但在深度推理和事实验证任务中仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据的处理和分析提供了宝贵资源，并提出了自动化评估框架。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Result: Transformer架构（如GPT）是主要技术，评估以实用性为主。合成文本在NLP任务中表现良好，但隐私问题仍需解决。

Conclusion: 合成医学文本在NLP任务中具有潜力，但需进一步解决隐私问题并加强人工评估。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

Result: 在复杂数据集上性能提升12%，在合成数据质量上达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: GraDe为LLMs的表格数据建模提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve

Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合分词策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer分词在捕捉局部DNA序列结构时表现良好，但存在词汇分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题。

Method: 通过结合6-mer分词和600次BPE循环生成的BPE标记，构建平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中分别达到10.78%、10.1%和4.12%的准确率，优于NT、DNABERT2和GROVER等模型。

Conclusion: 混合分词策略能同时捕捉DNA序列的局部和全局特征，为下游DNA分析和生物研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications

### [45] [Wide-In, Narrow-Out: Revokable Decoding for Efficient and Effective DLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18578)
*Feng Hong,Geng Yu,Yushi Ye,Haicheng Huang,Huangjie Zheng,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WINO的训练免费解码算法，用于解决扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）在快速并行生成中的质量与速度权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLMs在快速并行解码时存在严重的性能下降问题，主要由于标准解码的不可逆性导致错误方向积累。

Method: WINO采用并行草稿-验证机制，通过双向上下文验证和重新掩码可疑标记来优化解码。

Result: 实验表明，WINO显著改善了质量与速度的权衡，例如在GSM8K数学基准上加速6倍且准确率提高2.58%，在Flickr30K字幕任务中实现10倍加速且性能更高。

Conclusion: WINO为DLLMs提供了一种高效且可撤销的解码方法，显著提升了生成质量和速度。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Conclusion: SRAG-MAV框架在细粒度中文仇恨言论识别任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),
Self-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SRAG), and Multi-Round Accumulative Voting

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在专业领域表现不佳的问题，同时降低现有数据合成方法的高成本和性能限制。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，结合答案、问题、未标注数据、检查、逻辑和任务类型，生成高质量的指令调优数据。

Result: 构建了703k样本的数据集，实验显示AQuilt性能接近DeepSeek-V3，但成本仅为17%。

Conclusion: AQuilt在专业领域数据合成中表现出高效性和高相关性，为模型性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈直接融入提示模型的训练，统一了两种优化提示的方法，无需数据集收集，并在数学数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法分为基于文本反馈的无训练方法和基于数值奖励的训练方法，但缺乏统一框架。TRPrompt旨在结合两者优势。

Method: TRPrompt直接利用文本反馈训练提示模型，无需预收集数据集，并通过迭代改进生成提示。

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH数学数据集上，TRPrompt生成的提示实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRPrompt通过结合文本反馈和训练方法，提供了一种高效且统一的提示优化框架。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），通过提取指令中的清单并评估响应满足情况，结合AI和验证程序评分，显著提升了语言模型在多个基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法通常使用固定标准（如“有用性”和“有害性”）来调整语言模型，限制了其适应多样化指令的能力。RLCF旨在通过灵活的指令特定标准扩展强化学习在指令遵循中的应用。

Method: 从指令中提取清单，利用AI和验证程序评估响应满足情况，结合评分计算强化学习的奖励。

Result: RLCF在五个基准测试中均表现优异，包括FollowBench（硬满意度提升4点）、InFoBench（提升6点）和Arena-Hard（胜率提升3点）。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是提升语言模型支持多样化查询需求的关键工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究结合符号回归（SR）和答案集编程（ASP），从数值模拟数据中推导出可解释的数学关系，用于建模三维不可压缩流动，并确保结果既统计准确又物理合理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解流动物理与准确预测同样重要，而传统机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，因此研究采用SR来揭示复杂物理系统的数学关系。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值模拟数据中推导符号方程，并结合ASP框架确保结果的物理合理性。

Result: 推导的方程不仅近似模拟了抛物线速度分布和压力降，还与文献中的解析解完全一致。

Conclusion: SR能简化复杂流动行为为可解释方程，结合知识表示方法可提高数据驱动模型的可靠性和与领域原则的一致性。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统在自动化洞察生成中忽视了结构化推理过程，而真实数据分析需要一致的认知工作流。

Method: 提出I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务建模分析推理的认知步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中表现优于现有系统，特别是在规划连贯性和洞察对齐方面。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析代理设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Method: 识别定性时间轴规划的一个片段，其计划存在性问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题。

Result: 确定了适合确定性片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 该确定性片段可直接用于策略合成，避免了非确定性自动机的复杂性。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正创造力，认为创意潜力隐藏在失败中。

Method: 采用五阶段流程（错误生成、放大、精炼选择、转换、利用反馈），结合认知科学和生成模型，使用多种技术工具（如LLaMA-2-7B-Chat、CLIP等）和复合奖励函数。

Result: 创造力分数提升70.4%，精炼后的标语更短、更新颖，跨模态测试和人评显示高质量输出。

Conclusion: 错误驱动和反馈驱动的生成方法能有效提升AI创造力，为自进化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中式训练或缺乏理论保证。

Method: MAGPO采用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并与分散策略对齐以确保可部署性。

Result: 在43个任务和6个环境中，MAGPO表现优于现有CTDE方法，并接近或超过完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论支持且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为AI系统的自我加速研究提供了蓝图。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for

Conclusion: 该框架降低了机器学习生命周期的专家干预需求，为临床AI提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Result: 该方法能够更准确、高效地检测疫苗安全问题，减少假阳性，并优化标注数据的质量。

Conclusion: 研究为疫苗安全监测提供了一种快速、高效的解决方案，结合NLP和主动学习技术，显著提升了监测能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.

### [60] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，而在均匀设置下低于求和与最大聚合GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与不同聚合函数的GNNs进行比较。

Method: 在非均匀和均匀设置下分析均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与模态逻辑和MSO（Monadic Second-Order Logic）进行对比。

Result: 非均匀设置下均值GNNs的表达能力介于最大和求和聚合之间；均匀设置下低于后两者。

Conclusion: 均值聚合GNNs的表达能力受设置和假设条件影响，灵活性较高但相对较弱。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [61] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知归因框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）的知识与推理能力分离，通过快速和慢速思维模式分析其贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受双系统认知理论启发，旨在区分LLMs中知识与推理的作用，以提升模型分析、可解释性和开发。

Method: 将LLMs的认知分解为知识检索（阶段1）和推理调整（阶段2），通过不同思维模式生成答案并分析性能。

Result: 发现推理调整具有领域特异性，参数扩展提升知识与推理能力，知识主要分布在低层网络，推理在高层。

Conclusion: 框架为理解LLMs提供了新视角，并对现有研究（如扩展法则、知识编辑）提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种不遵循模型最小化原则的析取语义，证明其中三种方法（Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理放松）实际上是一致的，且比第四种方法（Strongly Supported Models）更强。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨非最小化析取语义在Answer Set Programming中的表现，比较不同方法的异同。

Method: 比较四种析取语义：Justified Models、Strongly Supported Models、Forks和DI语义，分析其定义和关系。

Result: 证明Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理放松实际上一致，且比Strongly Supported Models更强。

Conclusion: 三种方法构成一种共同的语义，且比第四种方法更强大，为析取语义提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI部署场景中的法律合规性和基本权利保护问题，特别是在欧盟AI法案的背景下。

Method: 采用定义性平衡（比例分析）和可废止推理，分析AI部署场景及其对基本权利的潜在影响。

Result: 提供了一个逻辑化的AI风险分析基础，适用于高风险AI系统和通用AI系统。

Conclusion: 未来将开发正式模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Result: 在2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克竞赛的1500多份真实学生答案上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，但开发项重写系统并确保其终止性和合流性具有挑战性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Method: ConDiFi包含607个发散思维提示和990个收敛思维多选题，用于评估14个领先LLMs。

Result: GPT-4o在新颖性和可操作性上表现不佳，而DeepSeek-R1和Cohere Command R+表现优异。

Conclusion: ConDiFi为评估LLMs在金融领域的安全和战略部署提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step

decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试和RL算法中验证了IB正则化的有效性，推理性能一致提升。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，并通过轻量级方法实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Motivation: 优化呼叫中心的路由策略，以减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间。

Method: 比较了基于模型（VI）和无模型（PPO）的强化学习方法，使用MDP框架和SBR模型。

Result: PPO在测试中表现最佳，实现了最高奖励、最低客户等待时间和员工空闲时间。

Conclusion: PPO是呼叫中心路由优化的有效方法，尽管训练时间较长。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Result: 通过实验验证，GPU加速的CT算法在大量实例中表现优异。

Conclusion: GPU加速的CT算法为处理大规模表格约束问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Conclusion: 训练数据对概念探测模型的性能至关重要，公开的数据集标签有助于未来研究。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统无法区分证据的科学质量，导致低质量或撤稿论文被等同对待。

Method: 提出VERIRAG框架，包括11点检查表、HV评分和动态接受阈值。

Result: 在四个数据集上，VERIRAG的F1分数提升10-14点，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VERIRAG显著提高了临床决策支持系统中证据的可信度和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

Abstract: In a Conversational Image Recommendation task, users can provide natural
language feedback on a recommended image item, which leads to an improved
recommendation in the next turn. While typical instantiations of this task
assume that the user's target item will (eventually) be returned, this might
often not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item
catalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user
frustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased
number of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task
of Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query
Performance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a
search engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational
performance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic
information contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.
Specifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed
representation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the
classification labels to predict the evaluation turn. Our evaluation scenario
addressed two recommendation scenarios, by differentiating between system
failure, where the system is unable to find the target, and catalogue failure,
where the target does not exist in the item catalogue. In our experiments using
the Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets, we measure the accuracy of predictors
for both system and catalogue failures. Our results demonstrate the promise of
our proposed predictors for predicting system failures (existing evaluation
scenario), while we detect a considerable decrease in predictive performance in
the case of catalogue failure prediction (when inducing a missing item
scenario) compared to system failures.

Conclusion: 新数据集和模拟器提升了CRS评估的真实性，揭示了现有评估方法的不足，为未来研究提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型上验证了RecPS在风险评估和模型遗忘中的有效性。

Conclusion: RecPS为隐私感知的推荐系统开发提供了量化工具，支持用户隐私保护。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning. Our code is

TL;DR: 论文提出利用LLM-based文本嵌入方法解决法律案例检索中的两大挑战：长文本限制和缺乏训练数据，并在实验中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律案例检索（PCR）中，传统IR方法受限于长文本和缺乏训练数据，而深度学习方法未能有效应用。

Method: 采用LLM-based文本嵌入方法，支持更长输入且无需训练数据。

Result: 在四个PCR基准数据集上，LLM-based方法优于BM25和监督式transformer模型。

Conclusion: LLM-based嵌入方法有效解决了PCR中的关键挑战，展现出优越性能。

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖领域专家维护先决技能关系，成本高且难以扩展，研究旨在验证LLMs是否能高效替代。

Method: 使用ESCO-PrereqSkill数据集，通过标准化提示策略评估13种LLMs，指标包括语义相似度、BERTScore和推理延迟。

Conclusion: LLMs在个性化学习、智能辅导和技能推荐系统中具有规模化应用的潜力。

Abstract: Prerequisite skills - foundational competencies required before mastering
more advanced concepts - are important for supporting effective learning,
assessment, and skill-gap analysis. Traditionally curated by domain experts,
these relationships are costly to maintain and difficult to scale. This paper
investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict prerequisite
skills in a zero-shot setting, using only natural language descriptions and
without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce ESCO-PrereqSkill, a benchmark
dataset constructed from the ESCO taxonomy, comprising 3,196 skills and their
expert-defined prerequisite links. Using a standardized prompting strategy, we
evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 4,
Qwen2, and DeepSeek, across semantic similarity, BERTScore, and inference
latency. Our results show that models such as LLaMA4-Maverick,
Claude-3-7-Sonnet, and Qwen2-72B generate predictions that closely align with
expert ground truth, demonstrating strong semantic reasoning without
supervision. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable
prerequisite skill modeling for applications in personalized learning,
intelligent tutoring, and skill-based recommender systems.

TL;DR: FastMMRec提出了一种高效的多模态推荐框架，仅在测试阶段使用图卷积网络（GCNs），显著提升了效率和可扩展性，同时缓解了模态隔离问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs在多模态推荐（MMRec）中的训练阶段存在效率低、成本高和模态隔离问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: FastMMRec框架仅在测试阶段使用GCNs，避免在训练阶段使用，从而提升效率和减少模态隔离。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FastMMRec在性能和效率上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FastMMRec通过优化GCNs的使用方式，显著提升了多模态推荐的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in
training recommender systems remain critical challenges, hindering their
practical deployment in real-world scenarios. In the multimodal recommendation
(MMRec) field, training GCNs requires more expensive time and space costs and
exacerbates the gap between different modalities, resulting in sub-optimal
recommendation accuracy. This paper critically points out the inherent
challenges associated with adopting GCNs during the training phase in MMRec,
revealing that GCNs inevitably create unhelpful and even harmful pairs during
model optimization and isolate different modalities. To this end, we propose
FastMMRec, a highly efficient multimodal recommendation framework that deploys
graph convolutions exclusively during the testing phase, bypassing their use in
training. We demonstrate that adopting GCNs solely in the testing phase
significantly improves the model's efficiency and scalability while alleviating
the modality isolation problem often caused by using GCNs during the training
phase. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently
demonstrating the performance superiority of FastMMRec over competitive
baselines while achieving efficiency and scalability.

TL;DR: STEER是一个安全的向量检索框架，通过近似嵌入保护查询文本隐私，同时保持检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前向量数据库服务提供商使用专有黑盒模型，用户需通过API暴露原始查询文本，导致敏感信息泄露风险。

Method: STEER利用不同嵌入模型语义空间的对齐关系，生成查询文本的近似嵌入，无需修改服务器端。

Result: STEER在保护隐私的同时，Recall@100下降小于5%，Recall@20比基线高20%。

Conclusion: STEER有效解决了敏感信息泄露问题，同时保持了检索性能。

Abstract: Vector Database (VDB) can efficiently index and search high-dimensional
vector embeddings from unstructured data, crucially enabling fast semantic
similarity search essential for modern AI applications like generative AI and
recommendation systems. Since current VDB service providers predominantly use
proprietary black-box models, users are forced to expose raw query text to them
via API in exchange for the vector retrieval services. Consequently, if query
text involves confidential records from finance or healthcare domains, this
mechanism inevitably leads to critical leakage of user's sensitive information.
To address this issue, we introduce STEER (\textbf{S}ecure \textbf{T}ransformed
\textbf{E}mbedding v\textbf{E}ctor\textbf{ R}etrieval), a private vector
retrieval framework that leverages the alignment relationship between the
semantic spaces of different embedding models to derive approximate embeddings
for the query text. STEER performs the retrieval using the approximate
embeddings within the original VDB and requires no modifications to the server
side. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that STEER
effectively safeguards query text privacy while maintaining the retrieval
accuracy. Even though approximate embeddings are approximations of the
embeddings from proprietary models, they still prevent the providers from
recovering the query text through Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs). Extensive
experimental results show that Recall@100 of STEER can basically achieve a
decrease of less than 5\%. Furthermore, even when searching within a text
corpus of millions of entries, STEER achieves a Recall@20 accuracy 20\% higher
than current baselines.

Motivation: 现有密集检索模型在EHR检索中表现不佳，主要由于缺乏医学知识或训练数据不匹配。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段从生物医学知识图谱中提取医学实体并注入知识；第二阶段利用大语言模型生成多样化训练数据。

Result: 在CliniQ基准测试中，DR.EHR显著优于现有模型，尤其在语义匹配任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DR.EHR为EHR检索提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

<details>

Motivation: 边缘设备上低比特量化模型的需求增加，但传统量化感知训练依赖完整数据集，计算成本高且隐私敏感数据无法集中处理。核心集选择技术虽能缓解计算负担，但小规模数据集下量化误差问题突出。

Method: QuaRC框架包含核心集选择阶段（使用相对熵分数）和训练阶段（采用级联层校正策略），以减少量化误差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，QuaRC使用1%数据子集量化ResNet-18至2比特时，Top-1准确率比现有技术提升5.72%。

Conclusion: QuaRC通过高效的核心集选择和误差校正策略，显著提升了小规模数据集下的量化模型性能，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: 因果不变知识确保跨设备一致性，分类任务表现优异，数据重建PSNR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 模型在语义通信中表现出高效、鲁棒性，适用于多样化数据场景。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Conclusion: 通过调整特征网络的自相似性可以有效提升深度神经网络的分类性能，尤其是在MLP和注意力架构中表现显著。

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Result: 动态策略平均减少81%的LLM调用，置信度改进后减少87%，准确性接近原始方法。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法有效降低计算成本，适用于不同规模和任务的LLMs。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动流量预测方法在不同城市环境中的适应性不足，且因个人流量模式的高不确定性和环境上下文缺失导致预测不准确。

Method: LSDM结合扩散模型的生成能力和Transformer的自适应学习能力，利用LLM捕捉多模态环境信息。

Result: 实验表明，LSDM在流量预测中表现优异，性能提升至少2.83%（R²），且均方根误差比同类模型（如CSDI）降低至少8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM通过结合扩散模型和LLM，显著提升了移动流量预测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

*Nicholas A. Pearson,Francesca Zanello,Davide Russo,Luca Bortolussi,Francesca Cairoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成式AI和Copula模型的新框架CoCAI，用于多变量时间序列的预测和异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列分析中的准确预测和鲁棒异常检测两大挑战。

Method: 利用扩散模型捕捉数据复杂依赖关系，结合共形预测技术校准预测区域，并通过降维和Copula模型进行异常检测。

Result: 在真实水务系统数据上验证了CoCAI的预测准确性和异常检测能力。

Conclusion: CoCAI在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于多变量时间序列分析。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

TL;DR: GenSelect利用LLM的长推理能力从N个候选方案中选择最佳方案，优于现有的点对点和成对评分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用LLM的比较能力或扩展性方面存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出GenSelect方法，通过LLM的长推理从多个候选方案中选择最优解。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，GenSelect表现优于现有评分方法。

Conclusion: GenSelect有效结合了LLM的比较能力和高效扩展性，适用于并行采样任务。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

TL;DR: 使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）进行降水降尺度，提高视觉真实性，并提供了新的数据集评估视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率降水预测对减少局部强降雨灾害至关重要，但传统数值模型仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用WGAN进行降水降尺度，利用最优传输成本生成更真实的降水场。

Result: WGAN生成的降水场视觉上更真实，尽管传统评估指标略低；其判别器与人类感知一致。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提升降水降尺度的视觉真实性，还为数据集评估和质量控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的'黑盒'特性及其难以捕捉节点间复杂交互模式的问题，促使开发更有效的可解释性方法。

Method: GraphEXT利用合作博弈论和社会外部性概念，将节点划分为联盟，分解为子图，并通过Shapley值量化节点重要性。

Result: 实验表明，GraphEXT在不同GNN架构上优于现有基线方法，显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: GraphEXT通过关注节点交互和结构变化，提供了一种更有效的GNN可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Result: 在20个零样本设计实验中，该方法生成的分子比基于正样本训练的模型更多样且成功。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术因其简单、高效和性能优势，有望成为分子设计的标准迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Motivation: 传统神经网络在处理非周期性输入和随机系统动态时存在局限性，因此需要一种更高效的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: MFNO通过镜像填充扩展标准FNO，结合Wong--Zakai定理和近似技术，理论证明其逼近能力。

Result: MFNO在分辨率泛化方面表现优异，性能优于或与LSTMs、TCNs和DeepONet相当，且样本路径生成速度更快。

Conclusion: MFNO是一种高效且通用的架构，适用于随机系统的动态学习，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在差分隐私机器学习中，当公开数据和私有数据存在显著分布偏移时，公开数据的价值。结果表明，偏移较小时，需要足够多的公开或私有数据；偏移较大时，公开数据无益。


<details>

Motivation: 研究在公开数据和私有数据存在分布偏移时，公开数据是否仍能为差分隐私机器学习提供额外价值。

Method: 扩展了公开-私有学习的下界，分析了高斯均值估计和高斯线性回归中分布偏移的影响。

Result: 偏移较小时，需要足够多的公开或私有数据；偏移较大时，公开数据无益。

Conclusion: 公开数据的价值取决于分布偏移的大小，偏移较大时其贡献有限。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Result: FL为云机器人操作提供了高效可靠的解决方案，但也面临挑战。

Conclusion: FL在云机器人操作中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以解决实际应用中的问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决传统方法在设计和优化多孔超材料时的高计算成本问题，通过深度学习提高效率和精度。

Method: 方法包括使用pVAE框架，结合LBM生成数据，并通过CNN预测水力特性，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为多孔超材料的逆向设计提供了高效工具，并公开数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Motivation: 解释SOTA神经网络性能的起源，特别是HTSR理论中的关键指标alpha和alpha-hat。

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学方法，推导SETOL理论，并通过3层MLP和SOTA神经网络验证。

Result: SETOL理论假设与实验数据高度一致，新指标ERG与HTSR的alpha指标表现一致。

Conclusion: SETOL为理解神经网络性能提供了新视角，并提出了可实际应用的层质量评估方法。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗性提示数据集要么规模小且不平衡（人类生成），要么缺乏真实性和创造性（机器生成），需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Seed2Harvest方法，通过引导扩展人类生成的对抗性提示种子，结合机器计算能力生成多样化的提示。

Conclusion: 人机协作在提升对抗性提示的多样性和有效性方面至关重要，为T2I模型的安全评估提供了全面且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Motivation: 现有方法在人口流动预测中存在局限性：传统模型依赖静态空间假设，深度学习模型难以跨城市泛化，LLMs计算成本高且无法捕捉空间结构。此外，许多方法通过聚类POI或限制覆盖范围牺牲分辨率。

Method: UrbanPulse采用时空图卷积编码器和Transformer解码器建模多尺度时空依赖，并通过三阶段迁移学习策略（预训练、冷启动适应、强化学习微调）确保跨城市泛化能力。

Result: 在加州三个大都市区的1.03亿条GPS记录上评估，UrbanPulse实现了最先进的准确性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UrbanPulse通过高效迁移学习，为高分辨率AI城市预测的跨城市实际部署迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Motivation: 现有帖子质量评估方法存在三大问题：单模态分类无法利用多模态线索、深度多模态融合引入噪声、无法捕捉复杂语义关系。

Method: MFTRR框架包括局部-全局语义关联推理模块和多层次证据关系推理模块，通过多模态数据和排名任务改进质量评估。

Conclusion: MFTRR通过模仿人类认知过程和多模态细粒度推理，有效提升了帖子质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释、隐私保护且对噪声鲁棒的工作流程，适用于复杂数据环境。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的学习范式TSEP-Machine Unlearning，用于选择性遗忘隐私敏感、污染或过时的数据，以提升交通状态估计与预测的信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的交通状态估计与预测（TSEP）依赖敏感数据，但隐私、网络安全和数据新鲜度问题可能削弱公众对智能交通系统的信任。

Method: 引入TSEP-Machine Unlearning范式，使训练后的TSEP模型能够选择性遗忘特定数据。

Result: 通过选择性遗忘，增强了数据驱动TSEP的可信度和可靠性。

Conclusion: TSEP-Machine Unlearning为解决隐私和数据安全问题提供了有效途径，提升了智能交通系统的信任度。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Motivation: 由于使用GRPO等方法微调大型语言模型的计算成本高昂，需要一种方法来优化资源使用。

Method: 提出预测框架，通过实验总结模型大小、初始性能和训练进度的经验规律，预测奖励轨迹并识别训练阶段。

Result: 发现训练分为三个阶段（缓慢启动、快速提升、平台期），并证明早期停止可减少计算开销而不影响性能。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于不同模型类型，为基于GRPO的高效微调提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率海洋数据对沿海管理、环境监测和海事安全至关重要，但现有数据（如Copernicus）分辨率不足。

Method: 采用监督深度学习框架，结合神经算子，实现偏微分方程求解和任意分辨率预测。

Result: 在真实Copernicus数据和合成Navier-Stokes数据集上验证了模型有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效降尺度海洋数据，并为偏微分方程提供灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

TL;DR: C-AAE结合了匿名自编码器和差分脉冲编码调制，有效保护用户隐私并减少数据量，同时保持活动识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的行为数据可能泄露用户身份，隐私保护在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM），先通过AAE提取活动特征并抑制身份信息，再用ADPCM进一步压缩和匿名化数据。

Result: 实验显示C-AAE将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15个百分点，数据量减少75%，活动识别F1分数仅下降5个百分点。

Conclusion: C-AAE在医疗传感器数据中平衡了隐私保护和实用性。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM 是一种分阶段混合精度的后训练量化框架，通过将80%的权重量化为1位、20%量化为4位，平均每个权重仅需1.6位，显著降低了大型语言模型的存储和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的部署面临参数庞大和计算成本高的问题，极低位量化虽能减少存储和加速推理，但极端压缩会导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出 Squeeze10-LLM，结合 Post-Binarization Activation Robustness (PBAR) 和 Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS) 两种创新方法，PBAR 优化权重重要性度量，FIAS 保留完整激活信息以减少误差传播。

Result: 在 LLaMA 和 LLaMA2 上的实验表明，Squeeze10-LLM 在低于2位的权重量化中达到最优性能，零样本分类任务的平均准确率从43%提升至56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM 是一种高效的量化方法，显著提升了低位量化下的模型性能，为 LLM 的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺或标注成本高的场景中，如何利用额外的监督信息（如置信度）提升分类模型的准确性是一个关键问题。

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督信息视为概率分布，并通过它们的仿射组合构建软标签。理论分析揭示了额外监督信息的本质作用。

Result: 额外监督信息的关键在于非硬标签类别的分布信息，而非硬标签的置信度。实验验证了该理论能提升分类准确性。

Conclusion: 额外监督信息和混合系数在软标签优化中起互补作用，理论分析为设计有效的监督信息提供了指导。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Motivation: 解决开放无线接入网（O-RAN）架构中多个移动虚拟网络运营商（MVNOs）竞争物理资源块（PRBs）的问题，同时满足客户端的概率延迟上限约束并最小化PRB利用率。

Method: 基于大数定律（LLN）设计奖励函数，并提出PDA-DRL方法，结合模型权重共享和个性化奖励机制。

Result: PDA-DRL方法比基线方法（如针对平均延迟优化的DRL模型）平均延迟降低38%。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL方法在延迟优化和模型个性化方面表现优异，优于传统聚合方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 该方法有效诱导目标代理做出次优决策，且无需修改环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在数学推理任务中如何通过自身置信度优化性能，减少对外部信号的依赖。

Method: 使用模型的前缀置信度选择最有希望的尝试，并在五个数学推理数据集上评估其性能。

Result: 前缀置信度缩放（仅32个标记）在准确性和计算效率上优于多数投票，且对长度偏差的敏感性较低。测试时训练虽优于基础模型，但未超越前缀置信度缩放。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度缩放是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，适用于数学推理任务的性能提升。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Conclusion: GraphALP通过结合LLM和伪标签技术，有效解决了类别不平衡和标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Result: 理论证明收敛性和稳定性，实验验证在合成和真实数据集上的最优性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过时序动态分析显著提升了噪声标签学习的性能。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 在跨数据集评估中（Argoverse2训练，NuScenes测试），展示了目标选择过程的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在新场景下的泛化性能。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Result: 在多个真实图数据集上测试，FedSA-GCL平均性能优于基线方法2.92%（Louvain）和3.4%（Metis）。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL在效率和鲁棒性上表现优异，为联邦图学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Motivation: 尽管基于线性规划的完全校正提升方法在理论上具有吸引力，但缺乏实证研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，验证这些方法的实际效果。

Method: 研究六种LP-based提升方法，包括两种新方法（NM-Boost和QRLP-Boost），在20个数据集上评估其性能，使用启发式和最优基学习器，并分析准确性、集成稀疏性、边际分布等指标。

Conclusion: 完全校正提升方法在实际应用中具有潜力，尤其在稀疏性和性能平衡方面表现突出，但使用最优决策树时存在局限性。

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Result: 在真实事件日志上表现优于现有技术，统计增强显著优于随机转换。

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM为过程预测中的数据增强提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Result: 在ELSA、Tesseract和AZ-Class数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少回归，同时保持检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在CL场景中显著减少安全回归，提升恶意软件检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

Result: 在NASA电池退化数据集上，TIDSIT将预测误差降低50%以上，SoH预测误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT在电池健康监测中表现优异，且可推广至其他不规则时间序列任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法依赖简单约定而非有效推理，提出需要设计新环境以测试核心假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前MARL算法在Dec-POMDP框架下的局限性，揭示其依赖简单约定而非环境观察和记忆推理。

Method: 通过案例研究分析智能体学习脆弱约定的现象，并展示任务设计对学习策略的影响。

Result: 发现智能体可能学习脆弱约定，任务设计不当导致模型表现不佳，而非模型本身限制。

Conclusion: 呼吁设计新环境，强调基于观察和记忆推理的行为，以真正测试MARL算法的能力。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Motivation: HyperDeepONets虽然提升了表达能力，但因其高计算和内存成本而受限。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个较小的低秩矩阵，以减少参数数量并正则化主干网络权重。

Result: 在常微分方程和偏微分方程实验中，PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets减少了70%的参数，并在预测精度和泛化能力上优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets是一种高效且性能优越的算子学习方法。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Method: 通过将需要多次前向传播的教师模型蒸馏为紧凑的学生模型（使用LoRA微调），比较了基于softmax和Dirichlet分布的两种蒸馏策略。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型在单次前向传播下，能达到与教师模型相当甚至更优的预测和不确定性量化性能。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明通过证据蒸馏可以在LLMs中实现高效且鲁棒的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

Motivation: 解决数据稀缺地区洪水预测和水资源管理中的准确性问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）结合43个未校准的水文模型，再通过储层计算（RC）进行误差修正。

Result: 在数据丰富和稀缺场景下，HYPER性能优于LSTM，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: HYPER为无测站流域提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Conclusion: 改进的双模拟度量在理论和实验上均表现出优越性，为强化学习任务提供了更有效的表示学习技术。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Conclusion: GLANCE为异质图提供了轻量、适应性强且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Conclusion: C2G-KD展示了在极少量真实数据下仍能保持拓扑一致性和多样性的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Conclusion: FMB定律为跨学科的学习算法提供了理论基础和设计框架。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Result: GPTQ具有几何解释和误差上限，理论支持其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为GPTQ提供了坚实的理论基础，并启发了未来量化算法的设计。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用重叠数据集构建合成数据的方法，以解决公平性测试中真实数据不足的问题，并验证了合成数据的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在高风险领域的广泛应用，测试其潜在危害和偏见变得至关重要，但获取包含人口统计数据的真实数据面临法律、隐私和代表性等挑战。

Method: 通过利用重叠数据集构建包含人口统计信息的合成数据，并验证其与真实数据的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，基于合成数据的公平性指标与真实数据一致，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为公平性测试提供了一种独立、模型无关的评估途径，尤其在真实数据有限时具有实用价值。

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SE(2)不变网络架构因显式计算所有对象对的相对位姿而导致的内存需求过高问题。

Method: 设计了SE(2)不变的点积注意力机制，通过线性内存实现高效计算。

Result: 实验证明该方法易于实现，且性能优于非不变架构。

Conclusion: SE(2)不变注意力机制在自动驾驶任务中具有高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验证明了生成框架和评估指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 多级条件扩散模型和Protein-MMD指标为蛋白质设计提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决物理环境中人机协作的复杂性问题，如连续状态-动作空间和物理约束带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了BASS方法（行为增强、模拟和选择），通过增强代理的多样性及其对动作结果的理解来应对物理环境中的挑战。

Result: 实验表明，BASS在AI-AI和人机协作中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Moving Out基准和BASS方法为物理环境中的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Result: 模型在测试集上达到80%以上的准确率，并能进行异常检测。

Conclusion: 系统成功实现了高效、低功耗的实时步态识别，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny
Machine Learning (Tiny ML) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The
system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Rumsfeld无知与无知之间的定义性问题，避免现有结果的平凡化。

Method: 假设两种可及关系不同（一种为另一种的任意子集），保留大部分有效性，并在不同双框架类上进行公理化。

Result: 提出了新的公理化结果，并应用于分析Fine的研究。

Conclusion: 通过区分可及关系，解决了定义性问题，同时保留了逻辑性质的有效性。

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

Result: 总结了FFMs的现状，并指出数据可用性、算法可扩展性和基础设施限制等挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为理解FFMs提供了全面参考，并为未来创新提供了实用路线图。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related
publications and resources will be maintained on our website

Result: 某些工具在特定标准上表现突出，工具组合在某些标准上表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出了对严谨性和透明度检测工具开发的见解和建议，并公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data

Conclusion: GenAI和MDE的结合为汽车软件开发提供了高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Conclusion: 符号推理与LLMs结合是自动化代码审查的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

Abstract: Building on the conceptual framework presented in our previous work on

container orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD
pipelines for automated testing and deployment. The implementation integrates

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing

Motivation: 现有自适应集成方法通常依赖粗粒度适应机制或简单投票方案，无法充分利用专家知识。

Method: DriftMoE采用紧凑的神经路由器和增量Hoeffding树专家池协同训练，通过反馈循环实现专家专业化。

Result: 在九种数据流学习基准测试中，DriftMoE表现优异，与最先进的自适应集成方法竞争。

Conclusion: DriftMoE提供了一种高效且原则性的概念漂移适应方法，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available
in our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguel-ceadar/drift-moe.

noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动标注框架，用于分析大型语言模型（LLM）嵌入空间的拓扑结构，通过自定义的LLM代理和扰动技术实现高效探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动探索LLM嵌入空间的拓扑结构以揭示其编码的语言特性需要大量人力，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 定义了一个可探索元素的分类法，并设计了两种基于LLM的自定义代理，通过扰动技术实现自动化分析和解释。

Result: 框架在可视化分析工作区中实例化，成功复现了BERT嵌入特性的研究，并进一步揭示了拓扑邻域的语言特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM嵌入空间的拓扑分析提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法，有助于深入理解其语言特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

TL;DR: 论文提出在联邦学习中引入缓存策略（FIFO、LRU和基于优先级）以减少不必要的模型更新传输，从而降低带宽使用并保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分布式设备中共享模型时，通信成本是主要瓶颈，尤其是在资源受限的环境中。

Method: 采用FIFO、LRU和基于优先级的缓存策略，选择性转发重要模型更新。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和医疗数据集上的实验表明，通信量减少且准确性损失极小。

Conclusion: 智能缓存提高了可扩展性和内存效率，支持边缘物联网网络中的可靠联邦学习，适用于智慧城市和医疗等延迟敏感场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves
scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Bittensor的SN9展示了去中心化预训练LLM的可行性，但存在模型本地化和奖励机制问题。IOTA通过协作架构解决了这些问题，实现了模型规模扩展和公平激励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SN9中模型本地化和奖励机制的问题，推动去中心化预训练的进一步发展。

Method: 采用数据并行和流水线并行的SWARM架构，结合激活压缩、Butterfly All-Reduce和CLASP公平激励方案。

Result: 实现了模型规模的线性扩展、通信带宽的显著降低、公平的贡献评估和抗共谋能力。

Conclusion: IOTA通过协作和公平激励，显著提升了去中心化预训练的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

TL;DR: PolyServe是一种新型多SLO调度策略，通过分组请求、负载梯度调度和资源共享，提高吞吐量并满足不同延迟需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将工作负载简单分类为延迟敏感（LS）或尽力而为（BE），忽略了延迟敏感类别的多样性，导致用户体验和调度效率不佳。

Method: PolyServe将请求按每令牌延迟需求分组，调度到服务器子集，并通过负载梯度、资源共享和动态分块优化调度。

Result: PolyServe实现了1.23倍的吞吐量提升，达到最优吞吐量的92.5%。

Conclusion: PolyServe通过精细调度和资源共享，有效解决了多SLO请求的调度挑战。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Method: 设计模块化后端抽象层，支持新硬件平台集成；提出类别感知的单次提示方法，提高生成质量。

Result: 评估显示任务难度差异显著，对训练不足的平台泛化能力差，针对性提示策略有效。

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench为LLM在DL内核生成领域的评估提供了全面且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升线性分组码解码性能，减少解码过程中的状态数量，同时利用强化学习优化现有高性能解码器。

Method: 将迭代解码映射为MDP，提出截断MDP以减少状态数量，设计基于Deep-Q网络的动作列表解码器，并利用代码的自同构群和反馈方法优化性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在BSC信道下的LDPC码解码中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在线性分组码解码中具有高效性和实用性，能够显著提升解码性能并降低复杂度。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Motivation: 解决在多方协作下隐私数据的保护与共享问题，防止单个用户准确重构数据，但允许通过协作实现准确重构。

Method: 提出一种数据驱动的极小极大优化框架，交替更新私有化器、重构器和对手，并在高斯和二进制场景下分析最优解。

Result: 理论最优解作为基准，验证了所提出的极小极大训练方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护数据共享中实现了平衡，确保数据安全的同时允许协作重构。

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI/ML模型在5G RAN中大规模应用时面临的模型漂移、供应商锁定和透明度不足等问题。

Method: 通过3GPP Releases 16-20逐步标准化AI/ML功能，包括模型传输、执行、性能监控和闭环控制。

Result: 提出了五块生命周期管理架构、KPI驱动监控机制和跨供应商协作方案。

Conclusion: 为6G的AI原生收发器奠定了基础，但仍需解决资源高效监控、环境漂移检测等挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

Abstract: Contemporary database systems, while effective, suffer severe issues related
to complexity and usability, especially among individuals who lack technical
expertise but are unfamiliar with query languages like Structured Query

Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of
data using natural language processing (NLP) - based intuitive interfaces, and
automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like
yet another markup language (YAML), java script object notation (JSON), and
application program interface (API) documentation. The system is intended to
strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is
purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling,
schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present
in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current
database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills,
manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI
database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its
schema models and execution formats.

Motivation: 尽管预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在常识推理方面表现优异，但如何将其应用于开放世界的机器人导航，超越预定义动作，仍是一个挑战。

Method: 利用MLLMs的跨模态理解和代码生成能力，结合视觉语言感知模型生成鸟瞰图价值地图，整合语义与空间信息。

Result: 在户外导航任务中验证了零样本视觉语言导航框架的可行性，并在Husky机器人上展示了室内外场景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了复杂语言指令的导航任务，展示了MLLMs在机器人导航中的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

Motivation: 解决移动机器人在无外部导航辅助（如卫星或摄像头）时，仅依赖惯性传感器导致的导航漂移问题。

Method: 采用物理信息神经网络框架（MoRPI-PINN），通过嵌入物理定律和约束到训练过程中，提高导航精度。

Result: 实验表明，MoRPI-PINN相比其他方法精度提升超过85%，且适用于边缘设备。

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN是一种轻量、高效的解决方案，适用于移动机器人的惯性导航。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

Method: 利用MLLMs和VFMs的协同作用，分两个阶段（部分级提取和区域级细化）从自然语言指令和RGB-D观测中动态构建3D空间约束，并将其编码为实时优化目标。

Result: 在语义丰富的家庭和稀疏的化学实验室环境中，ReSem3D在零样本条件下表现出强大的适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReSem3D通过动态构建3D空间约束，实现了在语义多样性环境中的高效操作，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Motivation: 解决新手在诊断推理中的认知偏差问题，优化基于场景的学习（SBL）的教学顺序。

Method: 在PharmaSim在线环境中，采用组间设计比较I-PS和PS-I两种教学顺序的效果。

Result: 两种教学顺序均有益，但PS-I在迁移任务中表现显著更优。

Conclusion: PS-I顺序更有效，为SBL设计提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

Motivation: 自动驾驶技术的广泛部署需要适应不同车辆类型、传感器、法规和文化差异，但目前研究多集中于特定场景，缺乏通用性。

Method: 采用两阶段微调：第一阶段通过国家特定奖励模型适应环境；第二阶段通过车辆特定迁移学习实现系统适应。

Result: 该方法整合了技术和社会政治因素，实现了跨技术、法律、文化和伦理差异的有效扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动过程为自动驾驶技术的广泛部署提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了数字孪生（DT）中的知识转移问题，提出了一种通过现实差距分析（RGA）模块实现模拟与现实操作间双向知识转移的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化框架，数字孪生从学术研究到工业应用的过渡复杂。本文旨在解决模拟与现实操作间的知识转移问题，特别是现实差距的校准。

Method: 研究通过集成RGA模块到现有DT框架中，利用数据管道连接RGA模块与其他组件（如历史存储库和模拟模型），实现双向知识转移。

Result: 案例研究表明，完全集成RGA模块和数据管道的方法能够在不影响效率的情况下实现模拟与现实操作间的双向知识转移。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为数字孪生的全面生命周期管理提供了有效解决方案，特别是在知识转移和现实差距校准方面。

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究评估了四种LLM代理通信策略在数学问题解决中的效果，发现双代理协作优于单代理，其中"同伴协作"表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同通信策略对LLM代理协作问题解决效率的影响，以优化AI教育中的应用。

Method: 在OpenAI GPT-4o模型的双代理聊天环境中，测试四种通信模式（师生互动、同伴协作、互教互学、批判性辩论），并使用MATH数据集评估。

Result: 双代理设置优于单代理，"同伴协作"准确率最高；陈述、确认和提示等对话行为对协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 多代理框架提升计算任务效率，但有效通信策略是解决AI教育中复杂问题的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Result: AI生成的笔记质量优于专家笔记，94%医生报告认知负担减轻，97%报告文书负担减少。

Conclusion: AI系统能有效减轻行政负担，支持高效高质量的医疗服务。

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Motivation: 随着AI从后台工具发展为交互式生成合作者，需要重新思考传统设计流程。

Method: 研究使用GPT-4和Stable Diffusion等模型，作为创意代理参与设计的迭代循环。

Result: AI不仅是自动化工具，还能参与构思、视觉化和决策。

Conclusion: 人机共创的新范式为设计流程带来变革。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve from a back-end
computational tool into an interactive, generative collaborator, its
integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of
traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the
emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for
automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual
conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of
large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles
of proposal, critique, and revision.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: PosterMate是一个海报设计助手，通过生成多样化的用户角色代理来模拟目标受众的反馈，帮助设计师整合意见并改进设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海报设计需要多样化的受众反馈，但实际收集和协调这些反馈具有挑战性。生成式AI可以模拟人类互动，但其在设计反馈中的应用尚不明确。

Method: PosterMate通过营销文档创建用户角色代理，收集每个代理的反馈，并通过讨论达成共识，最终整合到设计中。

Result: 用户研究表明PosterMate能捕捉被忽视的观点，并作为有效的原型工具。在线评估显示反馈符合角色身份，讨论能有效综合不同观点。

Conclusion: PosterMate展示了生成式AI在设计反馈中的潜力，能够模拟多样化受众并帮助改进设计。

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究教育工作者如何实际使用AI工具及其互动模式，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 采用四阶段编码流程，结合主题发现、代码本开发、结构化标注和模型评估，分析14万条教育工作者与AI的对话。

Result: LLMs在主题识别中表现可靠，尤其在复杂场景中优于其他模型；揭示了教育工作者使用AI的主要模式（如教学改进、内容创作等）。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助定性研究提供了可扩展模型，并揭示了生成式AI在教育实践中的潜在作用。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Conclusion: BrisT1D数据集为1型糖尿病管理技术的研究提供了多方面的应用潜力。

Abstract: Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has seen a rapid evolution in management
technology and forms a useful case study for the future management of other
chronic conditions. Further development of this management technology requires
an exploration of its real-world use and the potential of additional data
streams. To facilitate this, we contribute the BrisT1D Dataset to the growing
number of public T1D management datasets. The dataset was developed from a
longitudinal study of 24 young adults in the UK who used a smartwatch alongside
their usual T1D management. Findings: The BrisT1D dataset features both device
data from the T1D management systems and smartwatches used by participants, as
well as transcripts of monthly interviews and focus groups conducted during the
study. The device data is provided in a processed state, for usability and more
rapid analysis, and in a raw state, for in-depth exploration of novel insights
captured in the study. Conclusions: This dataset has a range of potential
applications. The quantitative elements can support blood glucose prediction,
hypoglycaemia prediction, and closed-loop algorithm development. The
qualitative elements enable the exploration of user experiences and opinions,
as well as broader mixed-methods research into the role of smartwatches in T1D
management.

Conclusion: 该框架为认知建模提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案，在自适应学习、人机交互和教育分析中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.

Result: 模型在角色分离任务中表现更优，同时减少了ASR解码中的小词删除错误。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了角色分离的准确性，并通过任务特定设计优化了联合ASR和RD的性能。

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

Result: 参与者主要采用端到端ASR系统，依赖引导源分离，优化说话人日志。尽管技术进步，复杂环境下的语音识别仍困难。

Conclusion: 端到端ASR和说话人日志优化是当前趋势，但复杂环境下的语音识别仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模系统中可扩展和结构感知控制的需求，避免现有方法的局限性。

Method: 直接通过组ℓ0范数正则化将控制器合成问题表述为非凸优化问题，并提出基于惩罚的近端交替线性化最小化（PALM）算法。

Conclusion: 填补了文献中的关键空白，实现了直接设计具有理论保证的组稀疏反馈增益，无需依赖凸松弛或限制性结构假设。

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学FMs在临床应用中可能因学习非生物技术特征（如手术/内窥镜技术、实验室程序或扫描仪硬件差异）而产生风险，需系统性研究其稳健性。

Method: 提出PathoROB基准，包含三个新指标和四个数据集，评估了20种FMs的稳健性，并开发了稳健化框架。

Result: 实验显示所有FMs均存在稳健性缺陷，非稳健性可能导致重大诊断错误；稳健化方法显著降低了风险。

Conclusion: 稳健性评估是临床采用FMs前的关键步骤，未来开发需将稳健性作为核心设计原则，PathoROB为跨领域稳健性评估提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TenVOO的参数高效微调方法，用于3D U-Net结构的DDPM模型在MRI图像生成中的优化，显著减少了参数数量并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D卷积操作参数高效表示的研究不足问题，提升MRI图像生成的效率。

Method: 利用张量网络建模，将3D卷积核表示为低维张量，设计TenVOO方法进行微调。

Result: 在三个脑MRI数据集上验证，TenVOO仅需0.3%的可训练参数，MS-SSIM性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TenVOO在参数效率和性能上均表现出色，为3D MRI图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

TL;DR: 利用高光谱成像和机器学习技术预测葡萄园叶片和冠层的氮浓度，发现特定光谱区域对氮含量预测具有稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氮是葡萄园中影响植物生长和产品质量的关键养分，但由于其时空变异性高，需要准确估计叶片氮浓度以实现精准施肥。

Method: 通过高光谱成像（400-1000nm）采集数据，结合特征选择方法和机器学习模型（Gradient Boosting和XGBoost）预测氮浓度。

Result: 机器学习模型在冠层和叶片水平上的预测R平方分别为0.49和0.57，关键光谱区域（如500-525nm、650-690nm等）对氮含量预测具有稳健性。

Conclusion: 研究表明高光谱成像结合特征选择和机器学习技术可用于葡萄园氮状态监测，为精准农业提供支持。

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been
benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and
MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource
provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in
TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and
facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HDF的新框架，通过两个模块增强时间-频率建模并优化样本不平衡问题，显著提升了动态面部表情识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多源数据和个体表达差异导致的样本异质性下性能下降的问题。

Method: 设计了Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM)和Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM)，分别用于时间-频率建模和动态平衡分类与对比损失。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上表现出色，显著提高了识别准确率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HDF框架在动态面部表情识别中表现出优越性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Motivation: 传统体育视频分析方法计算量大且缺乏对运动细节的理解，难以捕捉关键的运动阶段。

Method: 结合DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取、V-DWT-JEPA2编码器和LLM解码器，通过自监督学习和掩码去噪目标预训练。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集上表现优异，信息密度、动作复杂度和测量精度显著提升，性能优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SV3.3B为体育视频分析提供了高效、技术细节丰富的解决方案，适合设备端部署。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理复杂提示（尤其是多主体及其属性）时表现不佳，受人类绘画过程启发，提出分阶段生成方法。

Method: 将复杂提示分解为简化子提示，分阶段生成；利用自注意力机制控制全局布局，并通过交叉注意力机制和质心对齐损失增强属性一致性。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准测试中，Detail++显著优于现有方法，尤其在多对象和复杂风格场景下。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成和属性绑定优化，有效提升了复杂提示下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

Motivation: 当前的多模态模型架构在文本解码器和视觉编码器方面落后于大型语言模型（LLMs），因此需要改进。

Method: 在CoCa模型的基础上，引入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入，改进文本解码器和视觉编码器。

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练和微调任务中显著优于基线模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构在多模态任务中表现出更好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中显著提升零样本图像描述模型的性能，达到最优结果。

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据集提供了一种有效策略，显著提升了零样本图像描述任务的表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Conclusion: ViGText通过视觉和文本的详细分析，为深度伪造检测设定了新标准，保障媒体真实性和信息完整性。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS是一种轻量级、基于文本提示的胰腺肿瘤分割方法，无需手动几何提示，性能优于现有SOTA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌预后差，EUS图像分割因噪声和低对比度依赖专家标注，需高效自动化解法。

Method: 结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器和LoRA适配SAM架构，仅调优0.86%参数，实现自动分割。

Result: 在公共数据集上，自动提示下Dice达82.69%，NSD达85.28%，优于现有SOTA模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS为医学图像分割提供高效自动化解法，首次将提示学习引入SAM。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 高质量冷启动数据和难度控制强化学习对模型性能至关重要，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Free-Energy Posterior Network的新框架，通过联合建模分布不确定性和自由能，改进了OoD检测的语义目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如MC Dropout仅关注模型或数据不确定性，未能与OoD检测的语义目标对齐。

Method: 结合自由能密度估计器和Beta分布参数化，提出了一种直接估计不确定性的后验网络，无需随机采样。

Result: 在Fishyscapes等真实世界基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种语义明确且计算高效的解决方案，适用于不确定性感知分割。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba结合UNet和mamba机制，通过噪声抑制模块提升医学图像分割的泛化能力，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在数据稀缺场景中因过拟合噪声和无关模式而泛化能力受限的问题。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，集成UNet和mamba机制，并引入噪声抑制模块（NRM）以过滤无关特征。

Result: 在多个公开数据集（如MSD、AIIB23）上表现优于基线方法1-3%，在BraTS-21和内部NSCLC数据集上提升4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba有效提升医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在低数据条件下表现突出。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法在低光环境下表现不佳，缺乏专门的数据集和高效的微调策略。

Method: 提出flare和noise模拟模块生成高质量数据集，并设计基于光照引导和多尺度特征融合的PEFT策略。

Result: 在nuScenes-Night和RobotCar-Night数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DepthDark在低光环境下表现出色，且计算资源需求低。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

enhancing pseudo-label reliability during training. This comprehensive approach
analyses the accuracy and utility of LULC mapping techniques for various urban
planning applications. A case study of Hyderabad, India, illustrates
significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat

of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

Result: 在多种数据稀缺场景下，该方法显著提升了合成样本的质量和保真度，优于现有检测方法。

Conclusion: GARL方法有效解决了ISTD在数据稀缺情况下的性能问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该基准为半监督ECG分割方法的发展奠定了基础，并促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

<details>

Motivation: 航空的非CO2效应（如尾迹）对气候影响显著，但现有数据缺乏时间跟踪和来源航班信息，限制了模型的准确性。

Method: 使用地面全天空相机记录尾迹，并开发统一深度学习框架进行语义分割、实例分割和时间跟踪。

Result: GVCCS数据集包含122个视频序列（24,228帧），每段尾迹均标注并跟踪，为模型评估提供基准。

Conclusion: 该工作为更准确的尾迹监测和气候影响评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP指标上分别提高了7.3%、6.2%和6.6%，超越了BirdCLEF 2024的获胜模型。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化嵌入频率信息有效提升了鸟类鸣声分类的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

Conclusion: 该方法在有限数据和标注不准确的情况下表现优异，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Conclusion: 该框架促进了公平比较和加速研究，同时增强了对真实LiDAR感知对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Motivation: 3D环境中的对抗攻击对视觉感知系统的可靠性构成威胁，现有防御机制依赖被动策略和预设假设，适应性不足。

Method: Rein-EAD采用多步目标平衡预测准确性和熵最小化，结合不确定性导向的奖励机制优化防御策略。

Result: 实验表明Rein-EAD显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持标准准确性，并能泛化到未见过的攻击。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD适用于复杂现实任务，如3D物体分类、人脸识别和自动驾驶。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

TL;DR: VideoMind是一个视频为中心的全模态数据集，用于深度视频内容认知和多模态特征表示增强，包含103K视频样本，每样本配有音频和三层文本描述（事实、抽象、意图）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏深度认知表达（如意图），VideoMind通过提供意图表达和Chain-of-Thought生成方法，填补了这一空白。

Method: 数据集包含103K视频样本，每样本配有三层文本描述（事实、抽象、意图），采用Chain-of-Thought方法生成意图表达，并标注主题、地点、时间、事件、动作和意图。

Result: 建立了3K手动验证的黄金标准基准，设计了混合认知检索实验，评估了多个模型（如InternVideo、VAST、UMT-L）的性能。

Conclusion: VideoMind为细粒度跨模态对齐和深度视频理解（如情感和意图识别）提供了强大基准，数据已公开。

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.
The data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab,

TL;DR: EDA扩展了基于任意噪声的扩散模型设计空间，解决了EDM中固定高斯噪声的限制，提升了图像恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDM的固定高斯噪声模式限制了图像恢复的进展，强制注入高斯噪声会破坏退化图像并增加恢复复杂度。

Method: 提出EDA，扩展噪声模式的自由度，同时保持EDM的模块灵活性，理论上证明增加噪声复杂度不会带来额外计算开销。

Result: EDA在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除任务中表现优异，仅需5次采样步骤即超越多数任务专用方法。

Conclusion: EDA通过灵活噪声模式显著提升了扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的性能，且计算高效。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强任务中边缘连续性和细节保留的挑战。

Method: 结合GER理论、Evolving WKV Attention机制、Bi-SAB模块和MS2-Loss。

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和NIQE指标上表现领先，计算复杂度低，且能提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DRWKV在低光图像增强中具有显著优势，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

TL;DR: SIDA提出了一种利用合成图像进行零样本域适应的高效方法，通过生成源域风格的图像并应用图像翻译模拟目标域风格，显著提升了适应效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的方法难以捕捉复杂的现实世界变化且适应时间较长，因此探索利用图像数据提供更细粒度的风格线索。

Method: 通过生成合成图像模拟目标域风格，并引入Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块建模现实变化。

Result: 在多种零样本适应场景中表现优异，尤其在挑战性领域，同时显著减少适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA通过合成图像和高效模块设计，实现了零样本域适应的显著改进。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

TL;DR: Scenethesis是一种新型的3D软件合成方法，通过领域特定语言ScenethesisLang实现用户需求与生成3D软件之间的形式化追踪，支持细粒度修改和复杂空间约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法难以处理复杂空间和语义约束，且无法对特定元素进行修改。Scenethesis旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 基于ScenethesisLang（一种领域特定语言），将3D软件合成分解为多个阶段，支持独立验证、目标修改和系统约束满足。

Result: Scenethesis能准确捕获80%以上的用户需求，满足90%以上的硬约束，同时处理100多个约束，并在视觉评估中比现有方法提升42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis为3D软件生成提供了高效、灵活且约束感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本框架，用于文本到视频模型中的动态概念个性化，无需微调即可生成高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对每个实例进行微调，限制了可扩展性，因此需要一种无需微调的动态概念个性化方法。

Method: 利用结构化2x2视频网格训练轻量级Grid-LoRA适配器，并通过Grid Fill模块完成部分观察的布局，生成时间一致且身份保持的输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量且一致的视频，适用于未见过的动态概念和编辑场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本设置下实现了动态概念个性化，具有高扩展性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GeoAvatar提出了一种自适应几何高斯泼溅框架，通过APS分割高斯点并引入嘴部结构和部分变形策略，提升了3D头部虚拟化身的重建和动画质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D头部虚拟化身的生成中难以平衡身份保留（重建）与新颖姿态和表情（动画）的需求，尤其是在处理面部区域几何偏差时效果不佳。

Method: GeoAvatar采用自适应预分配阶段（APS）分割高斯点，引入嘴部结构和部分变形策略，并提出正则化损失以优化高斯点与3DMM面部的绑定。

Result: 实验表明，GeoAvatar在重建和新颖动画场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoAvatar通过自适应几何高斯泼溅和嘴部优化，显著提升了3D头部虚拟化身的生成质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有语音驱动的3D面部动画模型因依赖大型预训练语音编码器而导致的模型过大、仅适用于离线推理的问题。

Method: 采用混合知识蒸馏和伪标签技术，利用高性能教师模型训练小型学生模型，仅包含卷积和全连接层。

Result: 成功将模型内存占用降至3.4 MB，所需未来音频上下文降至81 ms，同时保持高质量动画。

Conclusion: 该方法为设备端实时推理提供了可行方案，推动了模型驱动的数字角色发展。

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke
wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By
highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI
systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了视觉输入作为攻击面的潜力，导致对LVLMs中RCAs的防御不足。

Method: 提出Vision Guided Optimization和Multi-Objective Parallel Losses，生成对抗性扰动以实现无限制输出。

Result: RECALLED显著增加了服务响应延迟和GPU资源消耗。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs的安全漏洞，为未来防御RCAs提供了框架。

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

TL;DR: LoRA-Leak框架揭示了基于LoRA微调的语言模型仍易受成员推理攻击（MIA），并提出防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIA忽略了预训练模型可能导致的信息泄露，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出LoRA-Leak框架，整合15种MIA（包括5种改进方法），并在三种任务中测试。

Result: 实验显示LoRA微调模型对MIA脆弱（如AUC达0.775），并提出有效防御策略。

Conclusion: 预训练模型加剧了MIA风险，需采取特定防御措施保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by
exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious

phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple

addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in

optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and

Result: 仅需三个OP即可重现结晶标签，C-index分类性能超过0.98（AUC），并能高效实时计算结晶度。

Conclusion: 该工作流为OP选择提供了数据驱动策略，并支持监测聚合物模拟中的结构转变，验证了熵和对称性在不同结晶阶段的作用。

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

TL;DR: Sandwich是一种基于CPU的LLM服务引擎，通过为预填充和解码阶段设计不同的执行计划，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU解决方案忽视了LLM推理中预填充和解码阶段的工作负载差异，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Sandwich引擎，分别优化预填充和解码阶段的执行计划，并在多种CPU平台上进行评估。

Result: Sandwich在吞吐量、延迟和资源需求方面均有显著提升，性能优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: Sandwich为CPU上的LLM服务提供了高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多电子倍增现象会严重影响高功率射频设备和加速器系统的性能，准确预测其敏感性是一个计算密集型挑战。

Method: 使用模拟数据集训练多种回归模型（如随机森林、XGBoost等），并通过IoU、SSIM和皮尔逊相关系数评估性能。

Result: 树模型在跨材料域泛化中表现更优，而多层感知机在结合多目标损失函数时表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究展示了机器学习在多电子倍增预测中的潜力与局限性，为加速器和射频系统设计中的数据驱动建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

Motivation: 解决大规模MIMO系统中深度学习模型训练所需高质量数据难以获取的问题，同时降低能耗和复杂度。

Method: 采用Transformer基础模型，结合数据增强方法，通过预训练特征提取器计算余弦相似性生成训练样本。

Result: 在相同能耗下，模型性能显著优于零强迫方法，接近加权最小均方误差性能，且复杂度降低8倍。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解决数据可用性和训练复杂性问题，推动了深度学习在大规模MIMO系统中的实际应用，并支持动态资源配置。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

Result: 在14,202个实例中，pact成功完成603个，而基线方法仅完成13个。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of

Motivation: 研究零阶查询复杂度在log-concave采样中的应用，特别是通过成员资格预言机从凸体中均匀采样的问题。

Method: 提出了一种改进的邻近采样器，并引入了一种退火方案以生成暖启动，同时利用热流超收缩性和对数Sobolev不等式改进混合保证。

Conclusion: 该方法在查询复杂度和暖启动生成上取得了显著改进，适用于更广泛的log-concave采样问题。

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

Conclusion: 该强化学习方法能高效探索复杂量子状态空间，合成接近最优的量子电路，为量子电路优化提供了资源高效的基础。

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

article aims to lower the entry barrier to quantum computing and encourage
further innovation in the field. The accompanying interactive application is a
proposal for the first version of a quantum machine learning playground for
learning and exploring QML models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska,Krzysztof Rajda*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究通过分析社交媒体上400位KOL的150万条帖子，探讨了新兴技术（如AI）的不确定性及其社会影响，发现KOL在塑造乐观技术未来和影响现实社会讨论中起双重作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨新兴技术（如AI）的不确定性及其在社交媒体上的讨论，理解KOL如何通过话语塑造技术未来和社会现实。

Method: 使用BERTopic建模、情感、情绪和态度分析等文本挖掘技术，分析2021至2023年X平台上的150万条KOL帖子。

Result: 识别出100个反映技术驱动未来的主题，KOL在乐观（如AI、IoT）和焦虑（如气候变化、战争）话题中起关键作用。

Conclusion: KOL通过技术叙事连接未来想象与现实讨论，在不确定性时期引导公众对新兴技术的关注。

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

TL;DR: 论文研究了歌词到歌曲生成模型（LS2）对训练数据记忆的脆弱性，提出了一种名为APT的攻击方法，通过同音替换改变歌词语义但保留声学结构，揭示了模型对训练内容的记忆现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索歌词到歌曲生成模型在训练数据记忆方面的脆弱性，以及这种记忆对多模态生成系统的影响。

Method: 提出APT攻击方法，通过同音替换修改歌词，测试模型对训练数据的记忆程度，并扩展到文本到视频模型。

Result: 发现模型会生成与训练内容高度相似的输出，甚至在文本到视频模型中触发视觉记忆。

Conclusion: 揭示了转录条件多模态生成系统中的关键漏洞，引发对版权、安全和内容来源的担忧。

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了银河中心过剩（GCE）的起源，通过神经网络辅助的模拟推断方法结合空间和光谱数据，发现GCE可能是大量暗弱点源或真正弥散性质的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCE的起源尚未明确，可能是暗物质湮灭或大量点源。此前研究因技术限制仅能分析空间结构，缺乏光谱信息。

Method: 采用神经网络辅助的模拟推断方法，结合空间和光谱数据，分析GCE的性质。

Result: 光谱信息显示点源需极暗弱，支持GCE可能是弥散性质或极大量点源（约10^5个）。若为点源，数量远超此前研究估计的数百个。

Conclusion: GCE更可能是弥散性质或由极大量点源组成，光谱数据的引入显著改变了此前仅基于空间结构的结论。

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要整合多模态信息以准确预测大脑对自然刺激的响应，为未来的多模态脑编码基准提供简单可扩展的基线。

Method: 使用预训练的视频、音频和语言嵌入，通过双向RNN编码时间动态，融合隐藏状态后传递到第二循环层，轻量级主题特定头输出响应。采用复合损失函数和渐进式课程学习。

Result: 在竞赛中排名第三，整体Pearson r = 0.2094，单区域峰值得分最高（平均r = 0.63），对最具挑战性的受试者（Subject 5）表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来的多模态脑编码基准提供了一个简单且可扩展的基线。

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future
multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.
