### [1] [Advancing Mental Disorder Detection: A Comparative Evaluation of Transformer and LSTM Architectures on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19511)
*Khalid Hasan,Jamil Saquer,Mukulika Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多种Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa等）与LSTM模型在心理健康障碍分类中的表现，发现Transformer模型性能更优，尤其是RoBERTa表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍的早期检测需求推动了自动化工具的开发，NLP技术（尤其是Transformer模型）为此提供了潜力。

Method: 研究构建了一个大型标注数据集，并比较了多种Transformer模型与LSTM模型在心理健康分类任务中的表现。

Result: RoBERTa在测试集上表现最佳（F1分数99.54%），而LSTM模型结合BERT嵌入也表现出色（F1分数>94%）。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在实时、可扩展的心理健康监测中具有显著优势，为临床和数字干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

### [2] [Setting The Table with Intent: Intent-aware Schema Generation and Editing for Literature Review Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19521)
*Vishakh Padmakumar,Joseph Chee Chang,Kyle Lo,Doug Downey,Aakanksha Naik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的模式生成方法，解决了现有研究中评估模糊和缺乏编辑方法的问题，并通过合成意图数据集和编辑技术提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术文献数量激增，需要有效组织与比较文档，但现有模式生成方法因评估模糊和缺乏编辑技术进展缓慢。

Method: 1. 通过合成意图增强未标注表格数据，创建数据集；2. 提出多种基于LLM的模式编辑技术，并对比单次生成方法。

Result: 合成意图显著提升基线性能；小型开源模型通过微调可媲美先进LLM；编辑技术进一步改进生成模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为模式生成提供了更清晰的评估方法和有效的编辑技术，推动了文档比较领域的进展。

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

### [3] [Mind the Language Gap in Digital Humanities: LLM-Aided Translation of SKOS Thesauri](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19537)
*Felix Kraus,Nicolas Blumenröhr,Danah Tonne,Achim Streit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WOKIE是一个开源、模块化的自动化SKOS词表翻译工具，结合外部翻译服务和LLM优化，提升多语言知识资源的可访问性和互操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字人文学科中语言多样性导致的资源访问、重用和语义互操作性问题。

Method: 结合外部翻译服务和LLM进行针对性优化，支持日常硬件运行，无需专业知识。

Result: 在15种语言的词表测试中，WOKIE显著提升了翻译质量、性能和本体匹配效果。

Conclusion: WOKIE通过自动化翻译和优化的本体匹配，支持更包容和多语言的研究基础设施。

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,
reuse, and semantic interoperability of knowledge resources. WOKIE combines
external translation services with targeted refinement using Large Language
Models (LLMs), balancing translation quality, scalability, and cost. Designed
to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,
and ontology matching improvements. Our results show that WOKIE is suitable to
enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

### [4] [Mitigating Geospatial Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models: Benchmarking and Dynamic Factuality Aligning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19586)
*Shengyuan Wang,Jie Feng,Tianhui Liu,Dan Pei,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估和减轻大语言模型（LLMs）中地理空间幻觉的框架，通过知识图谱和优化方法显著提升了模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在地理空间任务中表现出不准确的地理知识（地理空间幻觉），影响了其可靠性，但这一问题尚未被系统研究。

Method: 提出了一个基于结构化地理空间知识图谱的评估框架，并采用Kahneman-Tversky优化方法（KTO）动态调整事实性。

Result: 在20个先进LLMs上的评估揭示了地理空间幻觉，优化方法使性能提升了29.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和优化方法有效提升了LLMs在地理空间知识和推理任务中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19595)
*Yutao Sun,Zhenyu Li,Yike Zhang,Tengyu Pan,Bowen Dong,Yuyi Guo,Jianyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文综述了Transformer架构中自注意力机制的效率问题，介绍了线性注意力和稀疏注意力两种高效注意力机制，并探讨了其在大规模预训练语言模型中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，因此需要研究高效注意力机制以提升模型的可扩展性。

Method: 线性注意力通过核近似、循环公式或快速权重动态实现线性复杂度；稀疏注意力则通过固定模式、块级路由或聚类策略选择部分token进行计算。

Result: 综述整合了算法创新和硬件层面的考虑，分析了高效注意力在大规模预训练模型中的应用，包括纯高效注意力架构和混合设计。

Conclusion: 本文为设计和实现可扩展、高效的语言模型提供了理论基础和实践参考。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

### [6] [MOCHA: Are Code Language Models Robust Against Multi-Turn Malicious Coding Prompts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19598)
*Muntasir Wahed,Xiaona Zhou,Kiet A. Nguyen,Tianjiao Yu,Nirav Diwan,Gang Wang,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的代码分解攻击方法，并通过新基准MOCHA评估其鲁棒性。实验表明，多轮恶意提示下模型仍存在漏洞，但通过微调可显著提升防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在代码生成中的鲁棒性，尤其是对抗多轮恶意提示的能力。

Method: 提出代码分解攻击方法，并构建MOCHA基准进行系统性评估。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在多轮攻击下存在漏洞，微调后防御能力提升32.4%。

Conclusion: 通过微调MOCHA可增强LLMs的鲁棒性，无需额外监督。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

### [7] [HITSZ's End-To-End Speech Translation Systems Combining Sequence-to-Sequence Auto Speech Recognition Model and Indic Large Language Model for IWSLT 2025 in Indic Track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19616)
*Xuchen Wei,Yangxin Wu,Yaoyin Zhang,Henglyu Liu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HITSZ团队在IWSLT 2025 Indic赛道中提出了一种端到端语音转文本翻译系统，结合Whisper ASR模型和Krutrim LLM，在低资源场景下提升了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言对（英语与印度语言）的语音转文本翻译问题。

Method: 集成预训练的Whisper ASR模型和印度语言专用的Krutrim LLM，并探索了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法。

Result: 平均BLEU分数为英语到印度语言28.88，印度语言到英语27.86；CoT方法在部分语言对中显著提升翻译质量（如泰米尔语到英语BLEU提升13.84）。

Conclusion: 端到端系统在低资源场景下表现良好，但CoT方法的输出格式一致性仍需改进。

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

### [8] [MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634)
*Sara Papi,Maike Züfle,Marco Gaido,Beatrice Savoldi,Danni Liu,Ioannis Douros,Luisa Bentivogli,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCIF是一个多语言、多模态的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在多语言和多模态任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估多语言和多模态能力方面存在不足，MCIF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于科学讲座构建多语言人类注释基准测试，涵盖语音、视觉和文本三种模态及四种语言。

Result: MCIF提供了全面的评估工具，支持对模型在多语言和多模态任务中的表现进行深入分析。

Conclusion: MCIF的推出将促进多模态大型语言模型的开放研究和进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI在法律教育中的应用，特别是针对罗马尼亚语等资源不足的语言，通过评估LLMs和VLMs在理解和推理罗马尼亚驾驶法方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足法律教育中对AI工具的需求，尤其是在资源不足的语言环境中。

Method: 引入RoD-TAL数据集，结合文本和视觉问答任务，评估RAG管道、密集检索器和推理优化模型。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升检索性能，推理优化模型在问答任务中表现优异，但视觉推理仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: LLMs和VLMs在法律教育中具有潜力，但视觉推理仍需改进。

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

### [10] [Towards Inclusive NLP: Assessing Compressed Multilingual Transformers across Diverse Language Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19699)
*Maitha Alshehhi,Ahmed Sharshar,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言和单语言大语言模型（LLM）在阿拉伯语、英语和印度语言中的表现，重点关注模型压缩策略（如剪枝和量化）的影响。发现多语言模型普遍优于单语言模型，量化能保持准确性，而剪枝会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在低资源语言环境（如阿拉伯语和印度语言）中的能力，并研究模型压缩策略对其性能的影响。

Method: 对多种LLM（如BLOOMZ、AceGPT等）进行基准测试，分析量化（4位和8位）和剪枝策略的效果。

Result: 多语言模型表现更优，量化有效维持准确性，剪枝对性能有显著负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究为构建可扩展且公平的多语言NLP解决方案提供了关键策略，并强调需解决低资源环境中的幻觉和泛化错误。

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

### [11] [Ta-G-T: Subjectivity Capture in Table to Text Generation via RDF Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19710)
*Ronak Upasham,Tathagata Dey,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的三阶段流水线方法，用于从表格数据生成包含主观性的文本，通过RDF三元组提取、文本聚合和主观性注入，实现了事实准确性与主观解释的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成方法主要关注客观描述，而缺乏对主观性文本生成的探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) 提取RDF三元组；2) 聚合文本为连贯叙述；3) 注入主观性。使用小型T5模型而非大型语言模型。

Result: 在多项指标上表现优于Mistral-7B和Llama-2，与GPT-3.5相当。通过定量和定性分析验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了一种结构化流水线，通过中间表示增强表格到文本生成的事实准确性和主观性。

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

### [12] [Basic Reading Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19741)
*Zhi Zhou,Sirui Miao,Xiangyu Duan,Hao Yang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为基本阅读蒸馏（BRD）的方法，通过教育小型模型模仿大型语言模型（LLM）的基本阅读行为（如命名实体识别、提问和回答），使其在多项任务中表现优于或接近比其大20倍的LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理中表现出色，但计算资源需求高，限制了实际部署。现有蒸馏方法（知识蒸馏或任务蒸馏）忽略了小型模型在通用文本上的基本阅读能力训练。

Method: 提出基本阅读蒸馏（BRD），训练小型模型模仿LLM的基本阅读行为（如命名实体识别、提问和回答），随后将其应用于多种任务。

Result: 小型模型在语言推理基准和BIG-bench任务中表现优于或接近比其大20倍的LLM。分析显示BRD有效影响了小型模型的概率分布，并与现有蒸馏方法正交。

Conclusion: BRD为小型模型提供了一种有效的基本阅读能力训练方法，显著提升了其在多种任务中的表现，且与现有蒸馏方法互补。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在复杂数学问题中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 采用多阶段优化框架，包括基础模型、指导模型和思考模型，结合SFT和GRPO强化学习方法，以及长链思维训练。

Result: 在同类开源模型中达到最优性能，超越OpenAI的O1-mini和GPT-4o。

Conclusion: JT-Math-8B为数学推理任务提供了高效解决方案，展示了多阶段优化框架的有效性。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

Result: 轻量级模型能匹配人类注释，揭示《末日迷踪》系列与广义基督教小说及男女作者作品间的差异。

Conclusion: 计算工具能有效分析基督教小说，揭示其多样性和作者性别差异。

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

*Dong Du,Shulin Liu,Tao Yang,Shaohua Chen,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对超长输出的强化学习方法（UloRL），通过分段解码和动态掩码技术提升大语言模型的推理能力，显著提高了训练速度和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架在处理超长输出时效率低下，存在长尾序列分布和熵崩溃问题，因此需要改进方法以提升推理能力。

Method: 将超长输出解码分为短段，采用动态掩码技术（MPTs）避免熵崩溃，从而提高训练效率。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B-A3B模型上，训练速度提升2.06倍，性能在AIME2025和BeyondAIME任务中分别从70.9%提升至85.1%和50.7%提升至61.9%。

Conclusion: UloRL方法有效提升了超长序列生成下大语言模型的推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有长上下文LLMs在短上下文性能下降、构造成本高及多样性不足的问题。

Method: 基于类别任意组合短指令，并指导LLMs生成长上下文元指令的响应。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和QwQ-32B上，Flora增强的LLMs在长上下文基准测试中表现优异，同时保持短上下文任务的强性能。

Conclusion: Flora提供了一种高效、低成本的长上下文构造方法，显著提升LLMs性能且不影响短上下文能力。

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCAttention提出了一种异构注意力计算框架，通过键量化、值卸载和动态KV淘汰，在极端内存限制下实现高效推理，将KV缓存内存占用缩小至25%，且无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理长上下文输入时，KV缓存的巨大内存需求是主要挑战，现有压缩方法在内存减少超过85%时性能显著下降，且GPU-CPU协作策略未被充分探索。

Method: HCAttention结合键量化、值卸载和动态KV淘汰，兼容现有Transformer架构，无需微调。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，HCAttention在KV缓存内存占用缩小至25%时保持全注意力模型的准确性，12.5%时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: HCAttention首次将Llama-3-8B模型扩展至单块A100 GPU处理400万token，为KV缓存压缩设定了新标准。

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

TL;DR: DiscoDrive是一个合成的多轮对话语料库，用于解决现有数据集无法捕捉真实驾驶员与AI对话中的自发不流畅问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集未能真实反映驾驶员与AI对话中的不流畅特征（如犹豫、重复、自我纠正等），限制了对话AI的性能。

Method: 采用两阶段、提示驱动的合成方法，动态整合不流畅性生成3500个多轮对话。

Result: DiscoDrive在训练和低资源数据增强中表现优异，显著提升了多个指标（如BLEU-4、METEOR等），并在人类评估中优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: DiscoDrive填补了现有资源的空白，为训练和增强对话AI提供了多功能语料库，提升了处理真实不流畅对话的能力。

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

Motivation: 当前AI模型评估多集中于英语，可能导致其他语言的性能偏差，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 测试了6种LLM和4种MLLM在巴西葡萄牙语医学考试中的表现，并与人类考生对比准确性、处理时间和解释连贯性。

Result: 部分模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Claude-3-Opus）准确性接近人类，但在多模态问题上仍有差距，且非英语表现不足。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化非英语AI模型，改进训练方法和多模态推理，以确保医疗AI的公平可靠应用。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

Result: 在Task 1中获得第三名，验证了框架在提升答案可靠性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 优先考虑事实准确性的保守策略在复杂多模态RAG系统中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 早期通过社交媒体帖子检测抑郁症有助于及时心理干预，但现有数据集多为粗粒度标签，缺乏细粒度评估能力。

Method: 构建包含1,017条社交媒体帖子的数据集，标注抑郁片段并映射到12种症状类别；设计评估框架，利用零样本和少样本提示策略测试GPT-4.1、Gemini 2.5 Pro和Claude 3.7 Sonnet等LLMs。

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CaliDrop的新策略，通过校准增强令牌驱逐方法，以减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时减轻准确性损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成过程中需要大量计算资源，KV缓存虽然加速了生成过程，但其内存占用随序列长度、批量大小和模型规模线性增长，成为长上下文场景的瓶颈。现有压缩技术（如令牌驱逐）虽能缓解问题，但会带来准确性下降。

Method: 提出CaliDrop策略，利用附近位置查询高度相似的观察，对丢弃的令牌进行推测性校准，以减少令牌驱逐带来的准确性损失。

Result: 实验表明，CaliDrop显著提升了现有令牌驱逐方法的准确性。

Conclusion: CaliDrop通过校准优化令牌驱逐，有效平衡了内存占用和模型准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）输出中的社会偏见问题，以减少伦理上的公平性和伤害问题。

Method: 提出KLAAD框架，结合交叉熵、KL散度和Triplet损失，隐式对齐注意力分布，不直接修改模型权重。

Result: 在BBQ和BOLD基准测试中表现出更好的偏见缓解效果，且对语言建模质量影响最小。

Conclusion: 注意力级别的对齐为生成语言模型中的偏见缓解提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and
diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier
detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a
data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and
annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity

*Saurav Singla,Aarav Singla,Advik Gupta,Parnika Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于元学习的框架，用于在有限标注数据下检测跨领域的人类语言异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言异常（如垃圾信息、假新闻和仇恨言论）因稀疏性和多样性而难以检测，需要一种能快速适应新任务的方法。

Method: 将异常检测视为少样本二分类问题，结合元学习、原型网络和领域重采样进行训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，模型在F1和AUC指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在少样本文本异常检测中表现优异，并开源了代码和基准以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong
baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to
facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

*Runchao Li,Yao Fu,Mu Sheng,Xianxuan Long,Haotian Yu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAEDKV是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩框架，通过频域转换实现无偏信息保留，优于现有方法22%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长上下文任务中KV缓存的高内存和计算需求问题，避免现有压缩方法导致的偏置表示。

Method: 使用无限窗口傅里叶变换（IWDFT）将KV缓存转换到频域，实现所有token的均衡贡献。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中表现优于现有方法22%，在Needle-In-A-Haystack任务中检索准确率更高。

Conclusion: FAEDKV提供了一种高效、无偏的KV缓存压缩方案，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

*Akash Ghosh,Aparna Garimella,Pritika Ramu,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Sriparna Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从文本生成复杂统计信息图的方法，填补了现有AI在生成多子图表信息图方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI技术仅能生成简单图表，无法处理需要深度理解内容的复杂信息图。

Method: 提出Infogen框架，分两阶段生成信息图元数据并转换为代码，同时创建了首个基准数据集Infodat。

Result: Infogen在Infodat数据集上表现优于其他开源和闭源LLM，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Infogen为复杂统计信息图的自动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

### [32] [A Tensor-Based Compiler and a Runtime for Neuron-Level DNN Certifier Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20055)
*Avaljot Singh,Yamin Chandini Sarita,Aditya Mishra,Ishaan Goyal,Gagandeep Singh,Charith Mendis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种编译器框架，自动将DNN验证器的神经元级规范转换为基于张量的层级实现，解决了设计与实现之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNN的不可解释性，基于抽象解释的验证成为建立信任的实用方法，但现有验证器开发困难，设计与实现之间存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 通过一种基于栈的中间表示（IR）和形状分析，将神经元级语义转换为张量操作，并引入g-BCSR格式优化稀疏张量计算。

Result: 编译器框架实现了与手工优化实现相当的性能，同时简化了新验证器的开发。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN验证器的开发提供了灵活性和高效性，填补了设计与实现之间的语义鸿沟。

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG系统在多样化检索场景中表现有限，需自适应策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG在多样化知识源中的实际效果。

Method: 使用MassiveDS评估RAG系统。

Result: 检索对小模型有益，重排器效果有限，LLMs难以路由异构知识源。

Conclusion: 需开发自适应检索策略以提升RAG实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can
be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProsodyLM提出了一种新的语音语言模型训练方法，通过改进的标记化方案更好地学习韵律信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型在训练时通常将语音转换为离散标记，但这种方法难以有效捕捉韵律信息。

Method: ProsodyLM采用了一种简单的标记化方案，先将语音转录为文本，再添加词级韵律标记。

Result: ProsodyLM通过预训练即可学习多样化的韵律处理能力，如生成语音中的韵律细节、理解情感和重音等。

Conclusion: ProsodyLM在韵律信息保留和处理能力上优于传统方法，为语音语言模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型生成高质量古英语文本的框架，结合参数高效微调、数据增强和双代理流程，显著提升了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古英语资源稀缺，限制了现代自然语言处理技术的应用，亟需一种方法扩充其语料库并提升可访问性。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（LoRA）、数据增强（反向翻译）和双代理流程（内容生成与翻译分离）。

Result: 自动评估指标（BLEU、METEOR、CHRF）显著提升，BLEU分数从26增至65以上，人工评估也证实了高准确性和风格保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩充了古英语语料库，还为其他濒危语言的复兴提供了实用方案，结合了AI创新与文化保护目标。

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

TL;DR: Sem-DPO改进DPO方法，通过语义一致性加权提升文本到图像提示优化的效果，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法在自动提示工程中存在语义不一致问题，需改进以保持用户意图。

Method: 提出Sem-DPO，通过余弦距离加权损失函数，约束语义漂移。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Sem-DPO的CLIP相似度和人类偏好评分均优于DPO及现有方法。

Conclusion: 语义加权应成为提示优化的新标准，并为语言模型的语义感知优化奠定基础。

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Motivation: 长上下文场景中复杂布局的文档理解（DU）是视觉语言研究的重大挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注且低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）数据稀缺。

Method: 采用多代理交互框架，自动生成长上下文问题（单页和多页），覆盖英语和阿拉伯语文档。

Result: 生成的英语和阿拉伯语问题（AraEngLongBench）对主流开源和闭源LVLMs具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升LVLMs的长上下文理解能力提供了高效的数据生成方法，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在多轮对话中难以保持目标导向行为，限制了其在对话AI中的可靠性。

Method: 提出了用户目标状态跟踪（UGST）框架，并开发了一种三阶段方法，用于生成目标一致的用户模拟器。

Result: 在MultiWOZ 2.4和{\tau}-Bench两个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: UGST填补了对话AI中的关键空白，成为开发目标一致用户模拟器的重要框架。

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

TL;DR: SGPO是一种新型对齐框架，通过自生成偏好数据优化语言模型，无需外部标注数据，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法依赖人工标注数据和分布偏移问题，提出自生成偏好数据的优化框架。

Method: SGPO利用自改进机制生成偏好数据，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）统一改进器和策略模型。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard上，SGPO显著优于DPO和其他自改进方法。

Conclusion: SGPO为语言模型对齐提供了一种高效且无需外部数据的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Method: 引入意图树概念，提出数据集构建流程，构建SessionIntentBench基准，包含四个子任务，利用大量会话数据（1,952,177意图条目、1,132,145会话意图轨迹）进行实验。

Result: 实验表明当前L(V)LMs在复杂会话设置中难以捕捉和利用意图，但意图注入能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过意图树和SessionIntentBench基准填补了意图建模的空白，为未来研究提供了数据和评估方法。

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

Conclusion: 多样性增强训练在大型推理模型中具有潜力，MultiRole-R1展示了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

Result: 识别出一小部分潜在技能，这些技能能解释大部分性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用工具，用于识别冗余任务、辅助模型选择，并分析模型的潜在技能。

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

Conclusion: 结合多视角新闻表示和双尺度用户建模是有效的，模型已开源。

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合交互式叙事治疗师（INT）和创新时刻评估（IMA）的框架，用于提升语言模型在心理健康支持中的真实性和治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在心理健康支持中缺乏真实性和治疗进展的模拟，叙事疗法因访问限制和社会污名而未被充分利用。

Method: 通过INT模拟专家叙事治疗师，规划治疗阶段并生成专家级回应；IMA通过追踪“创新时刻”评估治疗效果。

Result: 实验显示，INT在治疗质量和深度上优于标准语言模型，并能生成高质量支持对话。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理健康支持提供了更真实和有效的解决方案，具有广泛的社会应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何利用语言特征建模和评估专家提问中的专业性，提出了一种新的注释框架，并通过实验证明语言特征能有效区分专家提问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业性在专家沟通中至关重要，但在高风险领域（如金融）中研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入新的注释框架量化金融分析师提问中的结构和语用元素，构建两个数据集（专业性和问题来源），并训练分类器。

Result: 语言特征与人类判断和问题来源高度相关，分类器性能优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 专业性是可学习的、领域通用的概念，可通过语言建模捕捉。

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

*Xiang Fei,Siqi Wang,Shu Wei,Yuxiang Nie,Wei Shi,Hao Feng,Can Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Post-Completion Learning (PCL)的新训练框架，利用模型输出完成后的序列空间，提升推理和自评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型训练在遇到结束标记时终止学习，忽略了完成后的潜在学习机会。

Method: 设计了白盒强化学习方法，模型根据奖励规则评估输出内容，并通过双轨SFT和RL混合优化推理和评估能力。

Result: 在不同数据集和模型上的实验表明，PCL优于传统SFT和RL方法。

Conclusion: PCL为语言模型训练提供了新路径，在提升输出质量的同时保持了部署效率。

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估框架，关注对话模型中隐含意见的表达，通过响应立场验证规范性对齐，以促进更包容的模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖表面特征（如人口统计或行为属性），忽略了对话中隐含的意见表达，可能导致模型输出强化有害刻板印象。

Method: 引入基于响应立场的对齐评估框架，结合PU在线学习和指令调优语言模型，评估隐含意见的规范性对齐。

Result: 框架揭示了隐含意见的（错误）表达方式，为模型行为的包容性改进提供了路径。

Conclusion: 通过关注隐含意见和响应立场，能够更全面地评估和促进对话模型的包容性和规范性对齐。

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

*Kang Yang,Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Tianxiang Zhang,Qianchun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoL-RL是一种新的训练范式，通过双目标优化框架将多步环境反馈信号集成到LLM中，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效利用多步离散的环境反馈信号，导致信息丢失或未能充分利用反馈。

Method: 结合MoL持续训练和GRPO后训练，通过双目标优化框架整合反馈信号。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中表现优异，Qwen3-8B模型达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MoL-RL为利用多步文本反馈增强LLM推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

TL;DR: 研究分析了多语言大模型Aya-23-8B在代码混合、填空和翻译任务中的表现，发现其语言处理机制与单语言模型不同，揭示了多语言训练对模型内部结构的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多语言大模型（如Aya-23-8B）的内部语言处理机制，并与单语言模型（如Llama 3和Chinese-LLaMA-2）进行对比。

Method: 使用logit lens和神经元专业化分析技术，研究模型在代码混合、填空和翻译任务中的表现。

Result: 发现Aya-23在翻译时激活类型相关的语言表示，代码混合的神经元激活模式受基础语言影响更大，且语言特定神经元集中在最后几层。

Conclusion: 多语言训练显著影响大模型的内部结构，为未来的跨语言迁移研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言阿拉伯语与标准阿拉伯语的差异限制了数字服务和教育资源的获取，阻碍了阿拉伯语机器翻译的发展。

Method: 评估了六种大型语言模型的提示技术，并开发了资源高效的微调管道。

Result: GPT-4o在提示技术中表现最佳，量化Gemma2-9B模型在微调中优于零样本GPT-4o，多方言联合训练模型性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源环境下实现高质量DA-MSA翻译提供了实用方案，推动了阿拉伯语NLP的包容性。

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

Motivation: 开发一个能够模拟和可视化语音发音过程的动态模型，以支持语音学教育和言语治疗。

Method: 基于UK-DYNAMO框架，整合发音未指定性、分段和手势控制以及协同发音原理，模拟六个关键发音器，使用连续和离散控制参数生成发音配置。

Result: 实现了DYNARTmo模型，并嵌入到基于网络的应用程序SpeechArticulationTrainer中，提供矢状面、声门和腭视图。

Conclusion: 当前模型专注于静态建模，未来将扩展动态运动生成和发音-声学模块集成。

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize
speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model
builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory
underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.
DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with
articulatory-acoustic modules.

Motivation: 现有基准多采用角色为中心的方法，简化用户与角色的互动为问答任务，无法反映实际应用需求。

Method: 引入RMTBench，基于用户动机构建对话，并设计多轮对话模拟机制和LLM评分。

Result: RMTBench通过关注用户意图实现，填补了学术评估与实际应用之间的差距。

Conclusion: RMTBench为评估LLMs角色扮演能力提供了更有效的框架，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）通过多头注意力机制内部编码输出序列长度信息，并能通过调整特定隐藏单元控制长度，而不影响文本信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部如何控制输出序列长度的机制，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过实证分析LLMs的内部表示，特别是多头注意力机制，研究输出长度信息的编码方式。

Result: 发现多头注意力机制是关键，长度信息与语义信息部分解耦，且某些隐藏单元对长度提示更敏感。

Conclusion: LLMs具备无需外部控制的、稳健且适应性强的内部机制来控制输出长度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

TL;DR: CoCoT是一种基于认知分阶段的提示策略，显著提升视觉语言模型在社交任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CoT在视觉社交任务中因同时需要感知、理解和判断而失效的问题。

Method: 提出CoCoT，分三阶段（感知、情境、规范）引导模型推理。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中平均提升8%，优于CoT和直接提示。

Conclusion: CoCoT增强模型的可解释性和社交意识，推动更安全可靠的多模态系统发展。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

TL;DR: CONCAP是一种多语言图像描述模型，通过结合检索到的描述和图像特定概念，减少对多语言训练数据的依赖，提升低资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中表现不如英语模型，主要由于多语言训练数据有限和大规模模型参数化的高成本。检索增强生成（RAG）是一种替代方案，但依赖从英语翻译的检索描述可能引入语言偏差。

Method: 提出CONCAP模型，将检索到的描述与图像特定概念结合，增强输入图像的上下文理解，并减少多语言训练需求。

Result: 在XM3600数据集上的实验表明，CONCAP在低资源和中资源语言上表现优异，且数据需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 概念感知的检索增强能有效缩小多语言性能差距，为多语言图像描述任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

Result: 发现当前基准测试在命名规范和语言现象覆盖上存在不足，提出了建立全球语言现象层次结构的必要性。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究应致力于制定统一的NLU诊断评估标准，以提升模型比较的深度和准确性。

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

Conclusion: 显式结构化NER指令（如代码提示）能有效提升模型表现，结合链式思维提示可进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

Motivation: 解决封闭领域（如教育、医疗和法律）中问答系统对透明推理和可解释决策的需求，同时克服现有神经符号框架在大规模模型和自然语言到形式逻辑转换效率上的不足。

Method: 提出Text-JEPA框架，模拟双系统认知理论：System 1生成逻辑表示，System 2（Z3求解器）进行推理。引入三个自定义指标评估NL2FOL到推理的流程。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上，Text-JEPA性能与大型LLM系统相当，但计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理框架（如Text-JEPA）在构建高效、可解释的封闭领域问答系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能数学推理大语言模型受限于缺乏新颖且困难的训练数据。

Method: 通过生成高质量数学问题并使用“难度提升”步骤系统增加问题复杂度。

Result: SAND-Math 数据显著提升模型性能，在 AIME25 基准上优于其他合成数据集 17.85 分。难度提升步骤将平均问题难度从 5.02 提高到 5.98，性能从 46.38% 提升到 49.23%。

Conclusion: SAND-Math 提供了一个实用且可扩展的工具包，用于构建更高效和强大的数学推理大语言模型。

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty
Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key
findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰等）对平台安全和社福祉构成挑战，现有研究缺乏统一的分类和方法综述。

Method: 通过系统综述49项研究，提出五种核心任务分类法，并分析建模技术（从经典机器学习到预训练语言模型）及数据集特征。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架组织该领域，为未来研究提供了方向，包括多语言建模、跨平台泛化和人机协同系统。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的KGC方法依赖隐式知识表示，容易传播错误知识，限制了推理的准确性和决定性。

Method: OL-KGC利用神经感知机制嵌入结构信息，并通过自动提取算法将本体知识转化为LLM可理解的文本格式。

Result: 在FB15K-237、UMLS和WN18RR三个基准测试中，OL-KGC显著优于现有主流方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OL-KGC通过结合结构信息和本体知识，显著提升了LLM在知识图谱补全中的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理异常重要性加权奖励时存在策略更新不稳定的问题，GMPO旨在通过几何平均优化解决这一问题。

Method: GMPO通过最大化几何平均奖励替代算术平均，减少对异常值的敏感性，保持重要性采样比的稳定范围。

Result: GMPO-7B在多个数学和多模态推理基准测试中平均表现优于GRPO，分别提升4.1%和1.4%。

Conclusion: GMPO通过几何平均优化提高了稳定性和性能，为语言模型推理提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

Motivation: 多语言错误信息的快速传播需要能够处理细粒度真实性评估的自动化事实核查系统，但目前大型语言模型在此任务中的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 在X-Fact数据集（涵盖25种语言和7种真实性类别）上评估了五种最先进的语言模型，包括小型编码器模型（XLM-R、mT5）和大型解码器模型（Llama 3.1等），采用提示和微调方法。

Result: XLM-R（2.7亿参数）显著优于所有测试的大型模型（70-120亿参数），宏F1分数达到57.7%，比之前的最佳性能（41.9%）提高了15.8%。

Conclusion: 对于细粒度多语言事实核查任务，小型专用模型可能比通用大型模型更有效，这对事实核查系统的实际部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: Text2VLM是一个多阶段管道，将纯文本数据集转换为多模态格式，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLM）对排版提示注入攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估数据集偏向纯文本提示，忽略了视觉漏洞，需要填补这一空白以提升VLM的安全性。

Method: 通过识别原始文本中的有害内容并将其转换为排版图像，生成多模态提示，评估VLM的脆弱性。

Result: 开源VLM在引入视觉输入时更易受提示注入攻击，且性能与闭源前沿模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Text2VLM为全面安全评估提供了可扩展工具，有助于开发更强大的VLM安全机制。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过结构剪枝和高效恢复训练直接压缩多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，以解决其计算和内存需求高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽然功能强大，但其高计算和内存需求限制了实际部署。现有参数缩减方法灵活性不足且计算成本高。

Method: 研究了两种结构剪枝范式（层间和宽度剪枝），结合监督微调和知识蒸馏，并评估了在少量数据下进行恢复训练的可行性。

Result: 宽度剪枝在资源有限时表现更好；仅微调多模态投影器即可在小压缩级别（<20%）下恢复性能；5%的训练数据可保留95%的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩MLLMs提供了实用指导，无需大量计算资源或数据，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多语言环境中的普及，需要无需大量标注数据的跨语言忠实度评估方法。

Result: 框架在跨语言评估任务中表现优于现有基线，包括最先进的英语评估器和机器翻译方法。

Conclusion: LLM的通用语言能力与其在语言特定评估任务中的表现存在一致关系，框架在多语言环境中具有潜力。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

Conclusion: 该综述为研究者提供了GPTE的现状与未来潜力的参考，强调了PLMs在推动GPTE发展中的重要性。

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动分析PFD报告的低效和不可扩展性问题，验证自动化语言模型在公共卫生数据分析中的可行性。

Method: 使用开源语言模型工具PFD Toolkit自动处理4,249份PFD报告，识别儿童自杀案例并进行主题编码。

Result: 工具识别出72份儿童自杀报告（比手动多一倍），与临床标注一致性高（Cohen's κ = 0.82），处理时间仅8分钟。

Conclusion: 自动化语言模型分析可高效、可靠地替代手动主题分析，为公共卫生提供可扩展的及时洞察。

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

TL;DR: DEP框架通过潜在空间建模用户差异，避免依赖语言提示，显著提升个性化输出效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖用户历史或语言提示，难以有效捕捉用户间差异，影响个性化效果。

Method: DEP通过对比用户嵌入与相似内容交互的同行嵌入，构建软提示，结合稀疏自编码器过滤任务相关特征。

Result: 在个性化评论生成任务中，DEP在多指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DEP通过潜在空间建模用户差异，提供了一种更有效的个性化方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多样性在NLP中日益受到重视，但缺乏系统化的理论支持，且术语不一致。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过调查ACL Anthology中相关文章，提出统一的多样性测量分类法，并基于Stirling框架（多样性、平衡性和差异性）进行分析。

Result: 发现多样性测量在不同场景中高度专业化且术语不一致，通过系统化框架揭示了趋势。

Conclusion: 本研究为NLP中多样性的形式化提供了基础，有助于更好地理解和比较不同方法。

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

TL;DR: 研究评估了九种开源生成式大语言模型（LLM）在荷兰语临床信息提取任务中的表现，发现部分14B参数模型表现优异，且原生语言处理优于翻译后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告信息丰富但结构复杂，专有LLM存在透明度和隐私问题，因此研究开源LLM在临床信息提取中的潜力。

Method: 使用公开框架llm_extractinator，在零样本设置下评估模型在DRAGON基准（28个荷兰语任务）中的表现。

Result: 部分14B参数模型（如Phi-4-14B）表现优异，Llama-3.3-70B性能略高但计算成本更大；翻译至英语会降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLM结合该框架可为低资源临床信息提取提供高效、可扩展且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

### [75] [Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20906)
*Jungwon Park,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Soft Injection的新方法，通过任务嵌入和软混合注意力头激活来减少提示长度并提升任务性能，显著优于传统ICL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICL方法需要多示例提示，效率低且效果不明确，因此探索更高效的任务信息传递方式。

Method: 使用少量示例构建任务嵌入，通过软混合参数将其注入注意力头激活，无需提示示例即可执行任务。

Result: 在57个任务和12个LLM上评估，平均性能提升10.1%-13.9%，同时减少内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: Soft Injection为减少提示长度和提升性能提供了新范式，揭示了注意力头的任务特定功能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset
designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical
recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains
32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical

Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as
Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial
gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

Motivation: 社交媒体中性别歧视问题日益严重，需开发有效识别与分类方法。

Method: 采用SCBM（基于形容词的可解释模型）、SCBMT（结合形容词与Transformer的模型）和微调XLM-RoBERTa模型。

Result: XLM-RoBERTa在部分任务中排名靠前，SCBMT表现中等但提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 模型在性能与可解释性上取得平衡，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在需要事实可靠性的高风险领域（如金融）中的幻觉问题。

Method: 构建合成数据集，插入标记错误，并微调四个语言模型（Phi-4、Phi-4-mini、Qwen3-4B、Qwen3-14B）以检测和编辑事实错误。

Result: 微调后的Phi-4模型在二元F1分数上提升了8%，整体检测性能提升了30%；Phi-4-mini模型在参数较少的情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融文本生成中的事实不一致问题提供了实用解决方案，并提出了一个可推广的框架，增强大语言模型的可信度和对齐性。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and

Result: 指令微调显著降低多样性，DPO影响最大；符合性解码能恢复多样性并保持质量。

Conclusion: 符合性解码是一种有效的方法，可在指令微调后恢复模型输出的多样性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Motivation: 医疗领域数据隐私敏感，研究旨在理解微调LLM时记忆化的风险，以平衡模型性能与隐私保护。

Method: 采用成员推理攻击检测记忆数据，并通过生成任务评估逐字复制。分析了Transformer架构中不同权重矩阵、困惑度与记忆化的关系，以及LoRA微调中秩的影响。

Result: 发现Value和Output矩阵对记忆化贡献更大；低困惑度与高记忆化相关；高LoRA秩增加记忆化，但边际效益递减。

Conclusion: 研究为微调LLM时的性能与隐私权衡提供了见解，有助于制定更有效的隐私保护策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

Motivation: 现实世界NLP应用需要多维度评估，但人类评估资源稀缺且昂贵，现有LLM评估方法存在角色设计随意和通用性不足的问题。

Method: 提出MAJ-EVAL框架，自动从文本构建多维度评估者角色，利用LLM代理进行群体辩论生成多维反馈。

Result: 在教育与医疗领域的实验中，MAJ-EVAL生成的评估结果比传统自动评估指标和现有LLM评估方法更符合专家评分。

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL通过多代理角色和群体辩论，显著提升了评估的多样性和与人类专家的一致性。

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Conclusion: WARPP显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

Conclusion: 本文总结了超博弈理论在动态多智能体系统中的趋势、挑战和未来方向，为其应用提供了新路线图。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在序列长度增加时计算量呈二次增长，现有动态注意力剪枝方法不适合边缘设备。DeltaLLM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DeltaLLM采用精度和内存感知的delta矩阵构建策略，引入时间稀疏性，并结合局部上下文窗口的完整注意力和外部delta近似。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上，DeltaLLM在预填充和解码阶段分别实现高达60%和57%的注意力稀疏性，且精度几乎无损。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM为边缘设备提供了一种高效部署LLM的解决方案，无需微调且兼容现有推理流程。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Conclusion: 为避免LLM的退化路径，需更重视对问题结构特征的洞察与理解。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏中的奖励稀疏性使强化学习面临挑战，内在动机方法虽能促进探索，但可能引发奖励黑客行为，目前其影响尚不明确。

Method: 在MiniGrid环境中实证评估了三种内在动机技术对RL代理行为的影响，并与GRM方法进行对比。

Result: 内在动机显著改变了代理的行为，提高了初始奖励，但也导致奖励黑客行为；GRM在某些场景中缓解了这一问题。

Conclusion: 内在动机确实影响RL代理的行为，GRM为缓解奖励黑客提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

*Yuzhang Xie,Xu Han,Ran Xu,Xiao Hu,Jiaying Lu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypKG框架通过整合电子健康记录（EHRs）和知识图谱（KGs），生成上下文知识表示，提升医疗预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对知识准确性和数据互联性要求高，但通用KGs缺乏患者特定上下文信息，而EHRs提供了丰富的个人数据。

Method: 使用实体链接技术连接KGs和EHRs，利用超图模型和超图变换器学习上下文化表示。

Result: 实验表明，HypKG在医疗预测任务中显著提升性能，并能调整KGs中实体和关系的表示。

Conclusion: HypKG通过整合外部上下文，提升了知识质量和实用性，适用于精准医疗。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

Result: 成功将船只历史数据转化为马尔可夫链模型，预测未来状态，并提出改进的概率模型。

Conclusion: 本体结构知识图谱结合马尔可夫链模型能有效预测未来事件，改进的概率模型更贴合实际动态现象。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

TL;DR: ASPBench是一个全面的ASP基准测试，揭示了当前大型语言模型在ASP求解中的局限性，尤其是在答案集计算任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补当前对大型语言模型在ASP中能力评估的不足，提供更全面的ASP任务基准测试。

Method: 引入ASPBench基准测试，包含三个ASP特定任务：ASP蕴含、答案集验证和答案集计算。

Result: 14个先进的大型语言模型在前两个简单任务上表现较好，但在核心的答案集计算任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要更有效地整合符号推理能力的新方法，以提升大型语言模型在ASP求解中的表现。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非稳态市场中供应链优化的复杂问题，同时平衡经济、环境和社会目标。

Method: 采用多目标强化学习（RL）方法，与改进的单目标RL算法和基于多目标进化算法（MOEA）的方法进行对比。

Result: 主要方法在最优性、多样性和密度之间实现了最平衡的权衡，复杂场景下超体积比MOEA方法高75%，解决方案密度是改进单目标RL方法的11倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在稳定生产和库存水平的同时，显著提升了供应链优化的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散的反事实提示学习框架DiCap，通过理论推导生成因果不变提示，显著提升了跨类别任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法因缺乏理论基础，难以生成因果不变的提示，导致特征提取不鲁棒。

Method: 采用扩散过程迭代采样梯度，生成满足最小充分性准则的反事实，并结合对比学习框架优化提示。

Result: 实验表明，DiCap在图像分类、图文检索和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，尤其在未见类别上优势明显。

Conclusion: DiCap通过理论驱动的反事实生成，显著提升了提示学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

*Olivia Guest*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了以人为中心的人工智能（AI）本质上是技术与人类认知劳动的关系，分析了AI对人类认知的替代、增强或中性影响，并强调必须直面人类在AI中的作用以避免认知科学的扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI与人类认知劳动的关系，揭示AI对人类认知的影响，并呼吁在AI设计中真正以人为中心。

Method: 通过对比技术与人认知劳动的例子（如算盘与心算、闹钟与敲门人等），提出新的定义和分析框架，将社会技术关系分为替代（有害）、增强（有益）或中性。

Result: 所有AI都涉及人类认知，忽视这一点会导致认知科学的扭曲和AI设计的局限性。

Conclusion: 必须直面人类在AI中的作用，才能真正实现以人为中心的AI设计。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

TL;DR: 该研究开发并评估了基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征的方法，通过微调开源LLM，实现了与GPT-4o相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取PCL特征耗时且限制了大规模研究，因此需要自动化工具。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成的链式思维（CoT）数据微调开源LLM（LLaMA和DeepSeek），并基于指南映射风险类别。

Result: 微调后，LLaMA和DeepSeek的特征提取准确率分别提升至97%和98%，风险分类F1分数接近GPT-4o（0.97），且与放射科医生的评估一致。

Conclusion: 微调的开源LLM在PCL研究中实现了高效、准确的表型分析，性能与GPT-4o相当。

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用（如全息通信、自动驾驶和工业物联网）对6G网络的资源分配提出了严格的要求，传统方法在动态环境中可能无法达到最优性能。

Method: 利用DTC预测信道状态信息（CSI），并通过轻量级博弈论算法进行在线资源分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比基于导频的理想CSI方案吞吐量提升高达11.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来6G网络提供了可扩展、低开销且环境感知的通信解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Conclusion: 目标是开发透明、可信的AI系统，不仅提供答案，还能展示答案的生成过程。

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

Motivation: 现实应用中稳定室友问题不一定总有解，因此需要找到“足够好”的匹配方案。

Method: 结合代理人的习惯偏好和社交网络，提出个性化解决方案。

Result: 通过示例和实证评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决稳定室友问题提供了实用且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

TL;DR: PITA框架通过直接整合偏好反馈到LLM的token生成中，无需预训练奖励模型，降低了计算成本并提高了稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练奖励模型，可能导致不稳定，PITA旨在消除这一依赖。

Method: PITA通过偏好分布学习小型指导策略，在推理时调整token概率，无需LLM微调。

Result: 在数学推理和情感分类等任务中，PITA有效对齐LLM输出与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA提供了一种高效且稳定的方法，直接利用偏好反馈优化LLM输出。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中神经网络缺乏透明性和可解释性的问题，尤其是隐式合作机制的不透明性。

Method: 提出CMQ方法，通过学习可解释的合作概念（表示为监督向量），并利用全局状态嵌入条件化个体动作值来表示每个概念。

Result: 在StarCraft II和LBF任务中，CMQ性能优于现有方法，并能捕捉有意义的合作模式，支持概念干预检测偏差。

Conclusion: CMQ突破了性能与可解释性的权衡，为多智能体合作提供了透明且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Motivation: 当前RL在大型语言和推理模型（LLMs/LRMs）中常产生脆弱和不稳定的策略，导致虚假推理、欺骗性对齐和指令不服从等问题，缺乏统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过数学框架分析奖励函数到最优策略的映射稳定性，探讨非唯一最优动作的影响，并将分析扩展到多奖励RL和熵正则化。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计更安全、可信的AI系统提供了理论基础，将政策稳定性分析从经验启发提升为原则性理论。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

promising direction for automated theorem proving and Math AI assistant.

Result: HFrame能区分更多非同态图对，速度提升显著，平均准确率高。

Conclusion: HFrame在子图同态问题上表现出色，为图神经网络应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical
databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information
from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is
currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical
information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model
(MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction.
We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics
from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score:
35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction
image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.
This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction
into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical
research.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine
that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances
decision making in complex R&D environments.

Result: 降维能保留足够对齐信息，同时显著降低通过表示工程越狱的易感性。

Conclusion: 高维度表示在安全对齐中既是优势也是隐患，降维是一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Conclusion: VLMPlanner通过视觉上下文和动态推理优化，显著提升自动驾驶规划的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

Motivation: 解决城市环境中移动资源（如共享单车、电动滑板车）的动态分配问题，以平衡供需关系。

Method: 采用分层自适应分组参数共享（HAG-PS）方法，结合全局和局部信息，动态调整智能体分组，并使用可学习的ID嵌入实现智能体专业化。

Result: 基于纽约共享单车数据的实验表明，HAG-PS在提高单车可用性方面优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: HAG-PS为多智能体强化学习在移动资源分配中的应用提供了高效且动态的解决方案。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Motivation: 随着LLM在自主代理中的应用增多，了解其空间推理能力对实际部署至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对无视觉线索下空间导航能力的评估。

Method: 通过坐标反馈和距离信息设计迷宫导航任务，评估8种LLM在英语和冰岛语中的表现。

Result: 模型性能差异显著，部分模型在小迷宫中表现完美，但在大迷宫中完全失败；冰岛语下性能明显下降。

Conclusion: LLM的空间推理能力受训练数据和语言影响，需架构创新以实现跨语言可靠导航。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Result: 在基准和实际问题中，MeLA生成的启发式比现有方法更有效、更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用认知科学设计AI架构（如元认知调节）能显著提升自动启发式设计的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

<details>

Motivation: 现有知识图谱（KGs）中存在过时或错误的知识需要移除，但现有遗忘方法（精确遗忘和近似遗忘）存在高成本或信息移除不完全的问题。

Method: GraphDPO将遗忘问题重构为偏好优化问题，通过DPO训练模型偏好重构的替代三元组，并引入边界外采样策略和边界回忆机制。

Result: 在四个流行KGs上的实验表明，GraphDPO在MRR_Avg和MRR_F1上分别比现有基线方法提高了10.1%和14.0%。

Conclusion: GraphDPO通过偏好优化和边界知识保护，有效解决了知识图谱遗忘中的信息移除不完全和剩余知识弱化问题。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

*Lijian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应模糊时间序列和部分不对称卷积架构的新方法，用于更准确地捕捉时空依赖性和全局信息，实现时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的预测模型在学习阶段缺乏捕捉时空依赖性和综合全局信息的能力。

Method: 1. 改进传统模糊时间序列构建策略，提取短期和长期时间相关性；2. 设计双边Atrous算法以减少计算需求；3. 设计部分不对称卷积架构以灵活挖掘数据特征。

Result: 在多个流行时间序列数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应模糊化和部分不对称设计，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

TL;DR: 论文研究了动态多智能体路径规划（D-MAPF）问题，提出了一种通用定义、新框架和基于ASP的解决方法，并通过实验评估了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，智能体和障碍物的动态变化（如进出或移动）需要动态路径规划，尤其是在仓库等有人环境。

Method: 1）提出D-MAPF的通用定义；2）设计新框架（支持多轮计算和多种方法）；3）开发基于ASP的方法（结合重规划和修复方法，引入隧道概念）。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在计算性能和解决方案质量方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 提出的D-MAPF框架和方法适用于动态环境，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within
a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles.
Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the
environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of
real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平性研究是静态的，而现实中的AI系统是动态演变的，因此需要研究公平性作为运行时属性。

Method: 使用动态演变的硬币投掷模型，分析监控和强制执行公平性的策略，参数化环境动态、预测范围和置信阈值。

Result: 总结了监控和执行策略，提供了简单或最小假设下的通用结果，并调查了现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 公平性需作为动态运行时属性研究，框架为不同动态环境提供了灵活的监控和执行策略。

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于启发式深度聚类的方法，用于学习社会共享的价值基础和多组价值系统，以更好地代表社会多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将社会价值系统视为个体价值系统的简单聚合，而社会科学和人文学科研究表明，社会价值系统应视为不同群体的价值系统集合。

Method: 提出了一种启发式深度聚类方法，通过观察代理样本的定性价值偏好，学习社会共享的价值基础和多样化的价值系统。

Result: 在旅行决策的实际用例中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地捕捉社会的多样性价值系统，为伦理AI的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

TL;DR: AI干预通过提高收听率，显著改善了母婴健康行为和知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动语音呼叫项目中受益者参与度低和流失的问题，并验证AI干预是否能转化为健康行为改善。

Method: 使用AI模型（如多臂老虎机模型）识别最需要干预的受益者，并进行实时服务呼叫。

Result: AI干预显著提高了收听率，并改善了健康行为（如补充铁和钙）和健康知识。

Conclusion: AI在改善母婴健康方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CoT提示如何增强模型推理的内部机制。

Method: 通过反向追踪信息流（解码、投影和激活阶段）进行定量分析。

Result: CoT可能作为解码空间剪枝器，利用答案模板引导输出生成，且任务依赖的神经元调制（开放任务减少激活，封闭任务增加激活）。

Conclusion: 研究提供了CoT的机制解释框架，为设计更高效和鲁棒的提示提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标（如BLEU和ROUGE）无法捕捉领域特定细节，而人工评估成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 开发了evalSmarT框架，结合约40种LLMs和10种提示策略，支持400多种评估配置。

Result: 结果显示提示设计显著影响与人类判断的一致性，LLM评估提供了可扩展且语义丰富的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLM评估为智能合约注释生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的评估方法。

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

Result: 在DocBench和MMLongBench数据集上达到最先进性能，展现强领域适应性和清晰推理路径。

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG有效解决了多模态RAG的局限性，提升了生成质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的离线算法POMCGS，用于解决大规模POMDP问题，通过动态折叠搜索树减少计算量，并支持连续POMDP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间或能量受限的应用中，离线策略更受欢迎，但现有离线算法无法扩展到大规模POMDP。

Method: POMCGS通过动态折叠搜索树构建策略图，结合动作渐进扩展和观测聚类方法。

Result: POMCGS能处理现有离线算法无法解决的最具挑战性POMDP，其策略值与最先进的在线算法相当。

Conclusion: POMCGS为大规模POMDP提供了一种高效的离线解决方案，适用于连续POMDP。

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大型神经语言模型在逻辑推理上的局限性，尤其是为何会出现幻觉、重复和有限规划等现象。

Method: 方法是将神经网络视为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，证明每层最多只能编码一个额外的逻辑推理层级。

Result: 结果表明，特定深度的神经网络无法忠实表示更高阶逻辑的谓词，如复杂谓词上的简单计数。

Conclusion: 结论是这种限制解释了模型的一些现象，并为未来语言模型的架构扩展和可解释性策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

Result: 在部分可观测环境中证明单轮和多步修正性，安全性违规概率有界且确保人类净收益。

Conclusion: 框架将奖励黑客风险转化为评估质量问题，为当前LLM助手和未来自主系统提供更清晰的实现指导。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为交互环境中减少LLM代理的幻觉行为提供了系统化的方法和工具。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了交互式配置系统的性能，并通过ASP实现的用户界面展示了其实用性。

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

TL;DR: GenoMAS是一个基于LLM的团队协作系统，结合了结构化工作流的可靠性和自主代理的适应性，用于基因表达分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基因表达分析的自动化方法要么过于僵化，要么缺乏科学严谨性，GenoMAS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GenoMAS通过六个专业LLM代理的协作，采用类型化消息传递协议和引导规划框架，动态调整分析流程。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准测试中，GenoMAS在数据预处理和基因识别任务上分别比现有最佳方法提升了10.61%和16.85%。

Conclusion: GenoMAS不仅性能优越，还能发现生物学上合理的基因-表型关联，同时调整潜在混杂因素。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于属性-结构同步的交互式可视化图匹配框架，结合CCA统一嵌入空间表示，支持快速交互匹配和结果验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图检索工具仅依赖结构相似性，忽略了节点属性的价值，需结合结构和属性信息提升匹配效果。

Method: 开发属性-结构同步方法，利用CCA统一嵌入空间表示特征；提供可视化查询接口支持交互匹配和结果验证。

Result: 在真实数据集上的案例研究和定量比较表明，该框架在图匹配和大图探索中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构和属性信息，显著提升了图匹配的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: In traditional graph retrieval tools, graph matching is commonly used to
retrieve desired graphs from extensive graph datasets according to their
structural similarities. However, in real applications, graph nodes have
numerous attributes which also contain valuable information for evaluating
similarities between graphs. Thus, to achieve superior graph matching results,
it is crucial for graph retrieval tools to make full use of the attribute
information in addition to structural information. We propose a novel framework
for interactive visual graph matching. In the proposed framework, an
attribute-structure synchronization method is developed for representing
structural and attribute features in a unified embedding space based on
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). To support fast and interactive matching,
\revise{our method} provides users with intuitive visual query interfaces for
traversing, filtering and searching for the target graph in the embedding space
conveniently. With the designed interfaces, the users can also specify a new
target graph with desired structural and semantic features. Besides, evaluation
views are designed for easy validation and interpretation of the matching
results. Case studies and quantitative comparisons on real-world datasets have
demonstrated the superiorities of our proposed framework in graph matching and
large graph exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究在理解用户意图一致性方面取得进展，但仍存在重复推荐问题，需解决。

Method: 使用统计分析和实验设计发现重复与模型及解码策略相关，提出AR-Trip方法，包含循环感知预测器的三种机制。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上实验表明，AR-Trip有效减少重复并提高推荐精度。

Conclusion: AR-Trip成功缓解重复问题，同时提升推荐效果。

Abstract: Trip recommendation has emerged as a highly sought-after service over the
past decade. Although current studies significantly understand human intention
consistency, they struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes that need
resolution. We make two pivotal discoveries using statistical analyses and
experimental designs: (1) The occurrence of repetitions is intricately linked
to the models and decoding strategies. (2) During training and decoding, adding
perturbations to logits can reduce repetition. Motivated by these observations,
we introduce AR-Trip (Anti Repetition for Trip Recommendation), which
incorporates a cycle-aware predictor comprising three mechanisms to avoid
duplicate Points-of-Interest (POIs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in
alleviating repetition. Experiments on four public datasets illustrate that
AR-Trip successfully mitigates repetition issues while enhancing precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI领域竞争激烈，新的大语言模型（LLM）不断涌现，但许多研究未充分利用这些进展。本研究旨在通过模型替换提升推荐系统性能。

Method: 在LlamaRec框架中用Llama3替换Llama2，设置随机种子并使用相同输入数据进行预处理和训练。

Result: 实验结果显示，ML-100K、Beauty和Games数据集的性能分别平均提升了38.65%、8.69%和8.19%。

Conclusion: 模型替换是一种无需系统结构改动即可高效提升推荐质量的方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非参数方法LCM4Rec，通过学习用户选择模型而非假设，提高了推荐系统中用户偏好推断的鲁棒性和抗曝光偏差能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统选择模型基于特定用户行为假设，但其准确性及假设错误对推断的影响尚不明确，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用核密度估计的非参数方法LCM4Rec，推断用户选择模型，同时捕捉用户偏好和选择行为。

Result: 实验表明LCM4Rec能准确恢复数据集的选择模型，提供鲁棒的用户偏好推断，并更抗曝光偏差。

Conclusion: 学习而非假设选择模型能生成更鲁棒的预测，为理解用户选择行为提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Choice models predict which items users choose from presented options. In
recommendation settings, they can infer user preferences while countering
exposure bias. In contrast with traditional univariate recommendation models,
choice models consider which competitors appeared with the chosen item. This
ability allows them to distinguish whether a user chose an item due to
preference, i.e., they liked it; or competition, i.e., it was the best
available option. Each choice model assumes specific user behavior, e.g., the
multinomial logit model. However, it is currently unclear how accurately these
assumptions capture actual user behavior, how wrong assumptions impact
inference, and whether better models exist.
  In this work, we propose the learned choice model for recommendation
(LCM4Rec), a non-parametric method for estimating the choice model. By applying
kernel density estimation, LCM4Rec infers the most likely error distribution
that describes the effect of inter-item cannibalization and thereby
characterizes the users' choice model. Thus, it simultaneously infers what
users prefer and how they make choices. Our experimental results indicate that
our method (i) can accurately recover the choice model underlying a dataset;
(ii) provides robust user preference inference, in contrast with existing
choice models that are only effective when their assumptions match user
behavior; and (iii) is more resistant against exposure bias than existing
choice models. Thereby, we show that learning choice models, instead of
assuming them, can produce more robust predictions. We believe this work
provides an important step towards better understanding users' choice behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的会话推荐方法主要关注ID序列信息，忽略了丰富的语义信息，限制了模型对用户真实意图的推断能力。

Method: 利用预训练的GNN选择候选物品集，结合LLM推断多语义意图，并通过对齐机制将语义意图与GNN的结构意图融合。

Result: 在Beauty和ML-1M数据集上的实验表明，该方法能显著提升GNN框架的推荐性能。

Conclusion: LLM-DMsRec通过整合多语义意图，有效提升了会话推荐的准确性。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) is mainly based on anonymous user
interaction sequences to recommend the items that the next user is most likely
to click. Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily
leverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as
graph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most
GNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information
of session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded
within them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to
accurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper
proposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic
Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The
method utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate
item sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer
multi-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an
alignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by
the LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments
conducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
can be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its
recommendation performance.

Motivation: LLM生成的广告文本在点击率上不一定优于人工创作，存在生成质量与在线表现的差距，因此需要优化方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 通过检索增强生成和链式推理进行多样化文本采样；2) 基于CTR增益和置信度的偏好优化。

Result: 在离线和在线实验中均表现优异，应用于大型电商平台后显著提升了CTR。

Conclusion: 该方法能端到端生成高CTR广告文本，具有强适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Advertising text plays a critical role in determining click-through rates
(CTR) in online advertising. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant
efficiency advantages over manual ad text creation. However, LLM-generated ad
texts do not guarantee higher CTR performance compared to human-crafted texts,
revealing a gap between generation quality and online performance of ad texts.
In this work, we propose a novel ad text generation method which optimizes for
CTR through preference optimization from online feedback. Our approach adopts
an innovative two-stage framework: (1) diverse ad text sampling via one-shot
in-context learning, using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide
exemplars with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning; (2) CTR-driven preference
optimization from online feedback, which weighs preference pairs according to
their CTR gains and confidence levels. Through our method, the resulting model
enables end-to-end generation of high-CTR ad texts. Extensive experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online
metrics. Notably, we have applied our method on a large-scale online shopping
platform and achieved significant CTR improvements, showcasing its strong
applicability and effectiveness in advertising systems.

<details>

Motivation: Decision Transformer在推荐任务中面临轨迹拼接问题和状态表示的高计算成本，需要改进。

Method: 结合Return-To-Go信号和时间优势信号，引入对比状态抽象模块，采用TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization策略。

Result: 在公共数据集和在线推荐系统中验证了TADT-CSA的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: TADT-CSA模型显著提升了推荐系统的性能，优于基线方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
generative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the
accuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to
LLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied
to sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory
stitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high
dimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in
recommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and
struggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State
Abstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional
Return-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that
encourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential
trend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into
the DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations.
Within this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization
(TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to
incorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction
network and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to
ensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current
state and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results
on both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the
effectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.

Motivation: 在快速发展和跨学科的研究环境中，传统方法依赖合著和引用关系构建研究网络，但难以全面捕捉研究者的兴趣。

Method: 使用BERTopic和SciBERT模型构建主题网络，引入克隆策略处理出版物不平衡问题，将每个聚类视为独立节点。

Result: 克隆网络结构能生成更有意义的社区，并发现更广泛的合作机会。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了跨学科研究者推荐的准确性和全面性。

Abstract: Finding potential research collaborators is a challenging task, especially in
today's fast-growing and interdisciplinary research landscape. While
traditional methods often rely on observable relationships such as
co-authorships and citations to construct the research network, in this work,
we focus solely on publication content to build a topic-based research network
using BERTopic with a fine-tuned SciBERT model that connects and recommends
researchers across disciplines based on shared topical interests. A major
challenge we address is publication imbalance, where some researchers publish
much more than others, often across several topics. Without careful handling,
their less frequent interests are hidden under dominant topics, limiting the
network's ability to detect their full research scope. To tackle this, we
introduce a cloning strategy that clusters a researcher's publications and
treats each cluster as a separate node. This allows researchers to be part of
multiple communities, improving the detection of interdisciplinary links.
Evaluation on the proposed method shows that the cloned network structure leads
to more meaningful communities and uncovers a broader set of collaboration
opportunities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统依赖外部资源（如知识图谱或大语言模型），导致数据依赖和计算开销问题；而无需知识的模型因缺乏增强原语而表现不足。

Method: 提出NodeDiffRec框架，通过扩散技术生成伪物品及交互，并通过去噪偏好建模细化用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集和推荐算法上表现优异，Recall@5和NDCG@5分别提升98.6%和84.0%。

Conclusion: NodeDiffRec无需外部知识即可显著提升推荐性能，成为高质量范式替代。

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as
knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which
limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and
computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster
recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation
primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps
as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works
that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a
pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained
node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of
restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items
and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for
injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference
modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and
structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the
superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with
maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5
over selected baselines.

Motivation: LLMTS在时间序列分析中表现出色，但面临知识产权保护和数据滥用的挑战。

Method: 利用时间序列补丁嵌入与特定LLM标记（冷标记）的对齐特性，通过重连相似性统计嵌入水印，并使用相似性z分数检测水印。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验表明，Waltz在保持生成时间序列质量的同时，实现了高水印检测准确率。

Conclusion: Waltz是一种有效且兼容性强的水印框架，适用于LLMTS模型。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown
remarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing
a significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis. However,
this emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the
substantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise
urgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their
powerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce
misleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,
we explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding
imperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain
detectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking
framework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz
is inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are
rarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold
tokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the
similarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and
detects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side
effects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification
strategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise
within a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models
across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark
detection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time
series.

Motivation: 轮班工人占工业化社会劳动力的15-20%，但在传统交通调查和规划中代表性不足，导致其独特的出行需求被忽视。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型，结合周期性时间嵌入和过渡损失函数，从碎片化GPS数据中生成完整的活动模式。

Result: 生成的数据与洛杉矶县的GPS数据分布高度一致（平均JSD < 0.02），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为交通规划者提供了强大的数据增强工具，有助于更全面、精确地理解城市24/7的出行需求。

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

Motivation: 传统神经网络层（如卷积和注意力机制）计算复杂度高且参数过多，希望通过小波域的学习提供更高效、可解释的替代方案。

Method: 在小波域中应用可学习的非线性变换（如软阈值和增益-相位调制），并引入可微分的小波基选择机制。

Result: 在3D去噪和GLUE基准任务（如SST-2情感分类）中，模型性能接近Transformer基线（89.3% vs 90.1%），但参数减少72%，内存占用降低58%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于小波域的学习在视觉和语言任务中的可行性，为模型设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练结构健康监测系统的数据昂贵且难以获取，尤其是标注数据。不同结构间的分布差异限制了传统机器学习方法的泛化能力。

Method: 利用物理知识选择相似特征，采用模态保证准则（MAC）量化健康结构模态间的对应关系，并验证其与监督度量的相关性。

Result: MAC与衡量联合分布相似性的监督度量高度相关，可作为选择跨域一致性特征的指标。

Conclusion: 通过数值和实验案例验证了MAC在特征选择中的有效性，为跨域结构健康监测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

Abstract: Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons
(MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research
advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset
\textit{AbnormalHeartbeat} that contains audio signals obtained from the
stethoscope.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents promising
opportunities for automation and enhancement in Electronic Design Automation

real-world documentation, each QA pair undergoes rigorous expert review for
accuracy and relevance. Our benchmark uniquely categorizes questions by design
stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning,
computation), and difficulty level, enabling detailed analysis of model
capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant
performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and
complex computations, highlighting the critical need for targeted training
datasets and modeling approaches. MMCircuitEval provides a foundational

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效材料设计提供了新途径，并展示了自然语言在材料设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: Javed等人（2024）提出SwiftTD算法，优化了True Online TD(λ)的性能，并将其扩展到控制问题，开发了Swift-Sarsa算法。该算法在操作条件基准测试中表现出色，能有效区分相关信号与噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有TD学习算法的性能，并扩展其适用范围至控制问题，特别是在噪声环境中有效学习。

Method: 结合SwiftTD的关键思想与True Online Sarsa(λ)，开发Swift-Sarsa算法，并通过操作条件基准测试验证其性能。

Result: Swift-Sarsa在操作条件基准测试中成功区分相关信号与噪声，无需先验知识，且能高效处理大规模特征。

Conclusion: Swift-Sarsa为噪声环境中的强化学习提供了高效解决方案，并具备处理大规模特征的潜力。

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANTERN是一种模块化架构，通过融合自适应调查响应和上下文信号来建模用户行为，优于仅依赖调查的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调查方法因用户疲劳和不完整响应而受限，需要更有效的行为建模方法。

Method: LANTERN采用选择性门控、残差连接和跨注意力机制，以调查数据为主信号，辅以外部模态。

Result: LANTERN在多标签预测中优于仅调查的基线，并通过消融实验验证了选择性模态依赖的优势。

Conclusion: LANTERN为以调查为中心的应用提供了实用且可扩展的行为建模框架。

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积自编码器的深度学习框架，用于从心房颤动（AF）的心内电图中无监督提取特征，以检测AF驱动源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前消融疗法对持续性AF效果不佳，因非肺静脉驱动源的存在。需自动化分析心内电图以识别这些驱动源。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器从单极和双极心内电图中提取潜在特征，并通过下游分类器检测旋转和焦点活动。

Result: 模型在检测旋转和焦点活动时表现中等（AUC 0.73-0.76），识别心房电图纠缠时表现优异（AUC 0.93）。

Conclusion: 该方法可实时运行并集成到临床电解剖标测系统中，展示了无监督学习在心脏信号分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Result: 在回归和分类任务中验证了自主学习的有效性，适用于线性任务，非线性规则下性能最佳。

Conclusion: BEASTAL方案通过简单局部规则实现物理系统学习，无需复杂架构或大规模内存，为低功耗学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Motivation: 解决传统方法需要访问本地数据和重复解决质量传输问题的高复杂度问题，提出一种低复杂度的算法。

Conclusion: 该算法高效且可扩展，适用于计算Wasserstein重心。

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it
to the state-of-the-art methods on several examples of mixture models.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

Motivation: 股票市场高度波动，传统交易策略难以稳定盈利，需开发更有效的决策方法。

Method: 设计四种损失函数，结合买入和卖空策略，训练时间序列模型（如Crossformer）。

Result: 在2021-2023年测试中，Crossformer模型表现最佳，收益分别为51.42%、51.04%和48.62%，优于强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 新损失函数结合时间序列模型能有效提升股票交易策略的盈利能力。

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络为何在特定任务（如阶梯函数）上显著优于核方法，并提出特征质量的概念以衡量性能提升。

Method: 引入特征质量概念，并通过实证分析现有特征学习理论的局限性。

Result: 现有理论主要评估特征学习的强度，而非特征质量，无法为神经网络泛化理论提供充分基础。

Conclusion: 需要发展更全面的理论以解释神经网络的特征学习质量及其对泛化的影响。

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Method: 将CAN流量表示为图，使用多层GAT作为教师模型，训练紧凑学生模型，结合监督预训练与知识蒸馏。

Result: 在Car-Hacking和Car-Survival数据集上，学生模型准确率分别达99.97%和99.31%，但在不平衡数据集can-train-and-test上表现下降。

Conclusion: KD-GAT有效提升检测性能，但需解决数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

Conclusion: 商业语义对共访模式预测至关重要，提出的方法在性能和可扩展性上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Conclusion: 分离生成模型框架在隐私保护和数据效用间取得了良好平衡，适用于多种模型类型。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

Motivation: 传统近似最近邻（ANN）检索方法在语义多样性和上下文丰富性上表现不足，无法满足如检索增强生成（RAG）等应用的需求。

Method: 提出了基于图增强的向量检索方法，通过在向量空间上叠加语义图（如kNN或知识链接）实现多跳、上下文感知的搜索。

Result: 理论分析了高维集中性下基于距离检索的局限性，并展示了图结构如何提升语义覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究为以意义为中心的向量搜索系统奠定了基础，强调混合索引、多样性感知查询和结构化语义检索。

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM有效解决了灾害场景下人类移动性预测的挑战，为灾害预警和资源分配提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next

Motivation: 实验测定酶的耐热性耗时且昂贵，现有计算方法受限于数据不足和不平衡分布。

Method: 利用精心整理的温度稳定性数据集，开发了Segment Transformer模型，结合蛋白质序列的片段级表示进行预测。

Result: 模型在RMSE、MAE和相关性指标上表现优异，实验验证显示突变后的酶活性提高了1.64倍。

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

Abstract: Bladder cancer claims one life every 3 minutes worldwide. Most patients are
diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), yet up to 70% recur
after treatment, triggering a relentless cycle of surgeries, monitoring, and
risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and
unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour

Motivation: 探讨联邦学习在医学影像中因本地配置（如优化器和学习率）而表现不稳定的问题。

Result: 本地优化器和学习率的选择对性能影响更大，且本地训练轮数的效果因FL方法而异。

Conclusion: 在联邦学习中，合适的本地配置比算法复杂性更重要。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GNSP的持续学习方法，通过将任务特定梯度投影到先前知识的零空间，避免灾难性遗忘，并结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失，保持CLIP的零样本能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在持续学习多任务时会出现灾难性遗忘和嵌入对齐退化问题，影响其零样本能力。

Method: 提出梯度零空间投影（GNSP）方法，结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失，保持嵌入空间结构。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，同时保持了CLIP的模态间隙和跨模态检索性能。

Conclusion: GNSP方法有效解决了CLIP在持续学习中的遗忘问题，保持了其零样本能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Motivation: 协调异构分布式能源资源（DERs）的产消者在本地能源市场（LEM）中的参与，并探讨价格操纵对交易的影响。

Method: 采用基于MADDPG框架的数据驱动、无模型强化学习方法，并结合VAE-GAN模型研究价格操纵策略。

Conclusion: 模型能有效协调产消者决策，但需警惕价格操纵对市场公平性的潜在威胁。

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

Motivation: 当前强化学习算法未能平衡LLM的长时推理能力和多轮工具交互能力，需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ARPO算法，结合熵自适应机制和优势估计，动态平衡全局轨迹采样和步骤级采样。

Result: 在13个基准测试中，ARPO优于轨迹级强化学习算法，且仅需一半工具使用预算。

Conclusion: ARPO为LLM代理在动态环境中的对齐提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Motivation: LLM缺乏对物理动态的直观理解，限制了其在需要因果推理的现实场景中的有效性。

Method: 引入Causal World Model Induction（CWMI）框架，包含Causal Physics Module（CPM）和Causal Intervention Loss训练目标，从多模态数据中学习因果关系。

Result: CWMI在PIQA和PhysiCa-Bench数据集上显著优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: 诱导因果世界模型是实现更可靠、泛化性更强的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Conclusion: RestoreAI通过模式预测提升地雷清除效率，线性模式是高效且可行的选择。

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Result: CLoRA性能与基线方法相当或更优，同时显著降低硬件需求。

Conclusion: CLoRA通过资源高效设计，为资源受限环境下的持续学习提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

Conclusion: 研究强调了联邦图学习中客户端身份泄露的风险，呼吁设计具有抗归属性的GNN模型。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

Motivation: 传统一阶优化方法（如SGD和Adam）在复杂损失函数中表现不佳，而二阶方法计算成本过高。DEO旨在通过物理启发的曲率估计改进训练效率。

Method: DEO基于Dimer方法，利用两个邻近点的梯度信息估计局部曲率，避免计算完整的Hessian矩阵，并通过投影梯度逃离鞍点。

Result: 在Transformer玩具模型上的初步实验表明，DEO在复杂损失函数中表现优于传统一阶方法。

Conclusion: DEO展示了物理启发的一阶曲率估计在高维神经网络训练中的潜力。

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy,

on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

### [193] [Irredundant $k$-Fold Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20048)
*Jesus S. Aguilar-Ruiz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Irredundant k-fold交叉验证方法，确保每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，减少了冗余和过拟合，同时保持性能估计的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-fold交叉验证中，实例的重复使用可能导致冗余和不平衡，影响学习效果和模型评估。

Method: 引入Irredundant k-fold交叉验证，每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，保持分层且模型无关。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法性能估计与传统k-fold相当，但方差估计更保守，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Irredundant k-fold交叉验证是一种更高效、平衡的验证方法，适用于多种数据集和模型。

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: $K^4$是一个无监督且不依赖解析器的日志异常检测框架，通过高效k-NN统计将日志嵌入转换为四维描述符，实现高性能在线检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志异常检测方法速度慢、依赖易出错的解析，且评估协议不现实。

Method: 使用k-NN统计将日志嵌入转换为四维描述符（精确度、召回率、密度、覆盖度），支持轻量级检测器无需重新训练即可准确评分。

Result: 在更现实的在线评估协议下，$K^4$达到AUROC 0.995-0.999，显著优于基线方法，且速度快（训练<4秒，推理低至4μs）。

Conclusion: $K^4$在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为日志异常检测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact
four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using
efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a
more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art
(AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being
orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low
as 4 $\mu$s.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了持续学习中神经网络的特征学习动态如何帮助克服早期数据偏见，并提出通过提高有效学习率来加速特征学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究持续学习中神经网络的特征学习动态，以解决早期训练数据导致的偏见问题，并探索其在非平稳学习问题中的应用。

Method: 提出通过增加有效学习率（参数与更新范数的比率）来诱导特征学习动态，从而加速特征学习。

Result: 该方法在多种场景（如grokking、神经网络热启动和强化学习任务）中促进了特征学习并提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 特征学习动态是解决持续学习中早期偏见问题的关键，提高有效学习率是一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过引入偏移量保护联邦学习中模型隐私的方法，利用Fisher信息矩阵使窃听者难以估计模型参数，同时通过安全共享偏移量保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的模型隐私，防止窃听者通过模型更新推断敏感信息。

Method: 将模型学习视为参数估计问题，通过偏移量驱动Fisher信息矩阵趋于奇异，使窃听者难以估计；同时安全共享偏移量以保持模型准确性。

Result: 方案在数值实验中表现出更高的模型偏移量，且所需带宽更少。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护隐私，同时保持模型准确性，优于噪声注入方案。

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了社交媒体上用户生成内容（UGC）的监管问题，提出通过机制设计优化言论自由与社会扭曲之间的平衡，并提供了近似最优解的方法和数据需求分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的UGC容易受到煽动和操纵，需要有效监管，但自动化内容审核会引发用户的策略性反应，需平衡言论自由与社会扭曲。

Method: 通过机制设计优化言论自由与社会扭曲的权衡，提出近似最优解的实用方法，并分析所需离线数据量。

Result: 虽然最优权衡问题是NP难的，但提出了近似最优解的实用方法，并提供了数据需求的泛化保证。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体内容审核提供了理论框架，平衡了言论自由与社会扭曲，并提供了实际可行的解决方案。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

TL;DR: 将最优传输（OT）引入偏微分方程（PDE）的算子学习，通过实例依赖的变形提升几何嵌入的灵活性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何学习方法通常将域表示为网格、图或点云，限制了复杂几何的处理能力。本文旨在通过OT方法改进几何嵌入，提升计算效率和精度。

Method: 将离散网格泛化为网格密度函数，通过OT问题将其映射到参考空间中的均匀密度。在3D表面模拟中，将几何嵌入2D参数化潜在空间，直接在2D表示上进行计算。

Result: 在ShapeNet-Car、DrivAerNet-Car和FlowBench数据集上，方法在精度和计算效率（时间和内存）上优于现有机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 基于OT的实例依赖变形方法在处理复杂几何时具有显著优势，为PDE算子学习提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，可靠的策略价值估计不确定性量化至关重要，而现有方法在使用数据增强时缺乏这一能力。

Method: 第一种方法通过新的共形预测方法为高维状态MDP构建策略性能的置信区间；第二种方法结合双重稳健估计和预测驱动推断，估计多初始状态的平均策略性能。

Result: 在机器人、医疗和库存管理的模拟器及真实医疗数据集MIMIC-IV上，新方法能利用增强数据并覆盖真实值，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效量化不确定性，适用于高风险领域，为策略价值估计提供可靠置信区间。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

Result: 通过模拟和脑电图数据分析验证了SEM的有效性，揭示了任务特异性的大脑连接模式。

Conclusion: SEM为复杂系统的动力学建模提供了新工具，尤其在脑连接分析中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练Transformer模型在代码处理任务中表现优异，但传统微调方法未能充分结构化嵌入空间以反映类内语义关系，影响等效代码突变检测等任务的性能。

Method: 提出Cluster Purge Loss，结合交叉熵损失和深度度量学习目标，动态调整类内边界以优化嵌入空间结构。以UniXCoder为基础模型。

Result: 在等效突变检测任务中达到最先进性能，并生成更具解释性的嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 新框架通过优化嵌入空间结构，显著提升了等效代码突变检测任务的性能，同时增强了嵌入空间的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic

Result: Meta Fusion在仿真和实际应用（如阿尔茨海默病检测和神经解码）中均优于传统融合方法。

Conclusion: Meta Fusion是一种模型无关的灵活框架，能显著提升多模态数据融合的预测性能。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

Conclusion: EcoTransformer是一种高效节能的Transformer架构替代方案。

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

Conclusion: Graded Transformer通过融合几何代数原理与注意力机制，为结构化深度学习提供了数学基础，推动高效可解释系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

Result: 离线算法有常数近似保证，在线算法遗憾界限为O(√T + ln²T)，下界证明紧致性。

Conclusion: PUCS框架及算法在实际应用中有效，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

Result: SVM在属性和产地预测中表现最优，准确率和F1分数超过91%；关键波长集中在250-420 nm。

Conclusion: 该技术为葡萄酒行业整合大数据和物联网提供了新思路，推动“智能酒庄”发展。

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AMLP的无监督框架，通过使MLP适应聚合而非直接设计聚合函数，解决了GNN中固定聚合函数在异质性下性能不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN通常采用固定的聚合函数（如Mean、Max、Sum），缺乏理论依据，尤其在异质性情况下表现不佳。现有方法依赖大量标注数据，而实际任务中标注数据稀缺。

Method: 提出AMLP框架：1）利用图重构方法实现高阶分组效果；2）使用单层网络编码异质性程度，提升模型能力。

Result: 在节点聚类和分类任务上的实验表明，AMLP性能优越。

Conclusion: AMLP为多样化的图学习场景提供了潜力，解决了固定聚合函数的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

TL;DR: MEVO是一个进化框架，通过结合VQ-VAE、扩散模型和进化策略，解决了结构药物设计中数据稀缺问题，生成了高亲和力配体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在结构药物设计中因数据稀缺而受限的问题。

Method: MEVO框架包含VQ-VAE、扩散模型和进化策略，结合药效团引导和物理评分优化分子。

Result: MEVO成功生成了高亲和力配体，并在KRASG12D抑制剂设计中表现出与已知高活性抑制剂相当的亲和力。

Conclusion: MEVO为结构配体设计提供了高效且数据节约的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

TL;DR: ASNN通过学习神经网络结构与测试准确率的关系，提出改进架构，优于随机搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络架构对性能至关重要，但目前缺乏通用的设计方法，主要依赖启发式或搜索。

Method: 构建数据集训练ASNN，输入准确率，输出架构参数，迭代预测高性能架构。

Result: ASNN在2层和3层架构中均提出优于原始数据的架构，提升平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: ASNN为神经网络架构优化提供高效替代方案，有望实现自动化设计。

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重要性采样的偏移校正方法（IS$^2$C），用于解决部分域适应（PDA）中的标签分布偏移问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域适应（PDA）中，现有的样本加权方法无法充分探索潜在结构，容易导致模型在源域上过拟合。

Method: 提出IS$^2$C方法，通过从构建的采样域中采样新数据来校正标签分布偏移，并结合最优传输理论进行条件分布对齐。

Result: 理论证明IS$^2$C能有效控制泛化误差，实验结果表明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS$^2$C通过采样和条件分布对齐，显著提升了PDA任务的性能。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Conclusion: TINs将传统技术指标与现代AI结合，推动了算法交易的发展，为金融分析开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in
financial analysis are, in essence, special cases of neural networks with fixed
and interpretable weights. It is shown that nearly all such indicators, such as
moving averages, momentum-based oscillators, volatility bands, and other
commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as
modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: TLRS通过密集奖励和奖励中心化机制，有效解决了稀疏奖励问题，提升了强化学习在金融领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且无需保留数据的后处理不确定性量化方案，适用于神经网络回归任务。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

Result: 在八项聚合物性质预测任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MIPS框架能有效预测聚合物性质，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 微调后的模型在教学帮助性、个性化和创造力方面显著提升。

Conclusion: EduAlign为开发更具教学对齐性的AI导师提供了可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

Conclusion: MH-GIN通过捕捉多尺度依赖关系显著提升了填补精度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Motivation: 现代半导体制造涉及数千个工艺步骤，传统的Shapley值方法无法处理序列化工艺和参考点选择问题。

Method: 扩展了Shapley值（SV），提出TSA框架，考虑了工艺的时序性并改进了参考点选择。

Result: 在NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab的实验性前端工艺中，TSA成功识别了与缺陷相关的关键测量项。

Conclusion: TSA为半导体制造中的缺陷根源分析提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法存在参数调优困难、计算复杂度高、可解释性差或准确性不足等问题。

Method: 利用预训练的先验数据拟合Transformer网络（PFN），通过预聚类样本引导整个数据集的聚类过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无预聚类样本时能成功聚类，少量预聚类样本可显著提升性能，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，是现有聚类技术的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Result: 在真实网络数据测试中，WBHT的F1分数提升1.65%至58.76%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: WBHT高效且能检测未知异常，适用于关键网络的主动监控和安全。

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical
networks.

Conclusion: DPPF通过平衡推拉力量，有效提升分布式训练的效率和泛化能力，理论支持其稳定性和收敛性。

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

Conclusion: ResCap-DBP展示了将全局蛋白质表示与先进深度学习架构结合的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Conclusion: 嵌入驱动的任务相似性估计具有潜力，能高效提升迁移学习效果。

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological
systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions
pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced
multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant
relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for
representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools
specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations

BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end
network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional
representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular
networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of
multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction
techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of
downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN
architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,
scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick
adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively
documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics
network analysis in precision medicine.

Motivation: 探索Transformer在复杂非线性任务中的ICL能力，填补现有研究在简单任务上的局限性。

Method: 分析注意力机制在训练中的阶段动态，引入新的证明技术，研究Lipschitz常数对注意力权重的影响。

Result: 注意力分数在早期快速增长并逐渐收敛，Lipschitz常数决定收敛时间，Transformer在收敛时能正确关注相关特征。

Conclusion: Transformer在复杂非线性任务中具备ICL能力，Lipschitz常数是关键影响因素。

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

Result: 实验显示BOASF在速度和预测性能上优于现有方法，且适应不同时间预算。

Conclusion: BOASF为自动化机器学习提供高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Result: 在信号和图像去噪任务中，WEEP表现优于L1范数和其他非凸稀疏正则化器。

Conclusion: WEEP解决了统计性能与计算可处理性之间的冲突，为稀疏正则化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

Conclusion: DGMM是一种在高维数据中平衡统计效率和计算复杂度的有效方法，为矩估计问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

Result: 基于Shapley值的稀疏化在保持预测性能的同时显著降低图复杂度。

Conclusion: Shapley值方法为图稀疏化提供了更优策略，兼顾效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法应用于超图时，会破坏高阶结构信息，导致性能不佳。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上，HIAL显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HIAL为超图主动学习提供了高效且强大的新范式。

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and

*Enjun Du,Siyi Liu,Yongqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoKGR是一个基于专家混合框架的知识图谱推理方法，通过个性化路径探索提升推理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在知识图谱推理中采用固定路径探索策略，难以适应多样化的语言上下文和语义细微差别。

Method: MoKGR包含两个互补组件：长度专家（自适应选择路径长度）和剪枝专家（评估并保留最有信息量的路径）。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，MoKGR在传递和归纳设置下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 个性化路径探索能有效提升知识图谱推理的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以适应多样化和高度可定制的用户策略，且需要大量重新训练或受限于上下文长度。

Method: 引入‘先例’概念，采用批判-修订机制收集高质量先例，并利用两种策略进行稳健预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本和全数据集场景下优于现有方法，且对新策略具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于先例的方法显著提升了护栏的灵活性和适应性，适用于动态用户需求。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

TL;DR: 提出DmC框架，解决跨域离线强化学习在目标数据有限时的数据集不平衡和部分域重叠问题，通过k-NN和扩散模型提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域离线强化学习方法需要大量目标数据，不适用于现实场景。DmC旨在解决目标数据有限时的数据集不平衡和部分域重叠问题。

Method: 使用k-NN估计域接近度避免过拟合，并结合最近邻引导的扩散模型生成与目标域更匹配的源样本。

Result: 在多种MuJoCo环境中，DmC显著优于现有方法，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: DmC为跨域离线强化学习提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其在目标数据有限时表现优越。

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

TL;DR: MPCCL模型通过多尺度权重粗化和对比学习，解决了图聚类中的长程依赖、特征崩溃和信息丢失问题，显著提升了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕获高阶图特征、特征多样性和结构细节保留方面存在不足，MPCCL旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 采用多尺度粗化策略和一对多对比学习范式，结合图重建损失和KL散度，确保节点表示的一致性。

Result: 在ACM数据集上NMI提升15.24%，在Citeseer、Cora和DBLP等小规模数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: MPCCL通过创新方法显著提升了图聚类的性能，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

Result: 在九个现成光学系统上训练，位置误差约1微米，角度偏差约0.01度。

Conclusion: 神经表示可作为光学光线追踪的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,

computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

Motivation: 黑盒优化中采样成本高，现有方法通过核学习减少样本需求，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 在变分自编码器的潜在空间中构建连续核空间，通过辅助优化选择最佳核。

Result: KOBO在合成基准和实际应用（如助听器个性化、生成模型）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KOBO能显著降低样本需求，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

Result: 早期MLP层处理语义内容，中间MHA层塑造输出；发现某些注意力头对种族和肤色身份特别关注。

Conclusion: 角色信息通过MLP和MHA层的协作影响模型推理，揭示了模型处理身份信息的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

Conclusion: STAFF是改善张量分解中群体公平性的有效方法。

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

Conclusion: DAG-AFL通过优化共识机制和验证策略，有效解决了FL中的资源消耗和效率问题，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少参数使用的同时，性能达到或超越现有PEFT基准。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR框架通过双系统分区和两阶段微调，有效提升模型性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: 论文结论是双阶段近似遗忘框架有效降低了隐私风险，同时计算成本仅为完全重新训练的2-12%。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

Result: 在NAS-Bench-Macro基准测试中表现优异，图像分类任务搜索时间减少86%，目标检测任务生成更高mAP的YOLOv8变体。

Conclusion: PhaseNAS在多种视觉任务中实现了高效、自适应和通用的神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically

*Julia Siekiera,Christian Schlötterer,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度生成神经网络的方法，用于模拟和估计等位基因频率轨迹的分布，解决了传统统计模型的简化假设问题，并在Pool-Seq数据中实现了竞争性的连锁不平衡估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于传统统计模型（如Wright-Fisher模型）在模拟等位基因频率轨迹时存在简化假设和参数不确定性的问题，而深度生成神经网络能够整合多变量依赖和降噪，但尚未在群体基因组学中广泛应用。

Method: 论文提出了一种深度生成神经网络模型，通过嵌入单核苷酸多态性（SNPs）及其邻近位点的信息，模拟基于时间经验观察的进化概念，估计等位基因频率轨迹的分布。

Result: 在模拟的E&R实验中，该模型成功捕捉了等位基因频率轨迹的分布，并展示了深度生成模型在连锁不平衡（LD）估计中的表现力，其LD估计结果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为Pool-Seq数据中的进化研究提供了新的工具，尤其在连锁不平衡估计方面表现出色，展示了深度生成模型在群体基因组学中的潜力。

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

*Filip de Roos,Fabio Muratore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Cholesky分解枢轴选择策略，通过连接贝叶斯非参数推断中的贪婪熵最大化，推导出新的枢轴策略，提高了算法效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cholesky分解在对称正定矩阵的线性系统中广泛应用，但其数值稳定性可通过枢轴策略改进。传统方法选择对角线上的最大值作为枢轴，但在贝叶斯非参数推断中，这与贪婪熵最大化相关，论文探索了这种联系。

Method: 提出新的枢轴选择策略，基于贪婪熵最大化的思想，优化Cholesky分解的枢轴顺序，并实现定制化算法。

Result: 新策略在稀疏回归和基于预处理迭代求解器的高斯过程推断任务中表现优异，多数情况下优于传统基线，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 论文通过连接Cholesky分解与贝叶斯非参数推断，提出了更高效的枢轴策略，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

Method: 提出数学方法（如熵或最优传输投影）修改经验分布以满足公平性约束，并研究如何检测数据操纵。

Result: 验证了通过操纵数据可以人为满足公平性标准，同时提供了检测此类操纵的建议。

Conclusion: 研究为审计人员提供了检测数据操纵的工具，同时揭示了潜在规避公平性检查的方法。

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance
(F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing
critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在不同领域表现不一，且确定性集成方法未考虑模型不确定性，限制了鲁棒性。

Method: UEC将确定性嵌入转化为概率嵌入，基于不确定性计算自适应权重，并引入不确定性感知的相似性评分。

Result: 在检索、分类和语义相似性任务中，UEC显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UEC通过不确定性建模为文本嵌入集成提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Method: 利用RAGTruth语料库和标记级注释，分析了幻觉信号如何依赖于标记在幻觉跨度中的位置。

Result: 研究发现，第一个幻觉标记的信号更强且更容易检测。

Conclusion: 论文提供了分析框架和工具，有助于改进标记级幻觉检测。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

Result: 证明在特定条件下，该流形的维度与动作空间维度同阶，并通过实验在MuJoCo环境和玩具环境中验证了这一理论。

Conclusion: 通过引入局部流形学习层，改进了高自由度控制环境的性能，验证了理论结果的实用性。

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主观或依赖专业设备，需开发客观、数据驱动的检测方法。

Method: 使用124名参与者的数据（PDFOG+、PDFOG-、健康对照），提取EEG信号和临床变量，训练BiSAM模型，测试不同模态和通道子集。

Result: 多模态模型（BiSAM-8和BiSAM-4）分类准确率达88%，显著优于单模态模型（信号55%，临床68%）。

Conclusion: 多模态BiSAM模型为PDFOG+检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于临床监测和早期诊断。

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

Motivation: 多标签数据流中的分布演变、高维标签空间和标签依赖性问题需要新的解决方案。

Method: iHOMER通过在线聚类和树学习器动态分区标签空间，并集成漂移检测机制。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在在线多标签分类中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

Conclusion: 该方法为CPI预测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于数据稀缺的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 解决PINNs在四阶偏微分方程中精度受限的问题，提升其在工程应用中的实用性。

Method: 结合截断傅里叶级数和深度神经网络，采用两阶段优化策略（Adam和L-BFGS）和自适应权重平衡。

Result: L2误差降至1.94×10^-7，比标准PINNs提升17倍，比传统数值方法提升15-500倍。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计，机器学习可以在科学计算中达到或超越传统数值方法的精度。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:

*Rongyao Cai,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Kexin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARSD是一种新的无监督域适应（UDA）框架，通过表示空间分解实现域适应，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列分析中域偏移问题，现有方法未考虑特征的内在组成。

Method: DARSD包含三个组件：对抗学习的公共不变基、原型伪标签机制和混合对比优化策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于12种UDA算法，35/53场景中表现最优。

Conclusion: DARSD通过分解表示空间有效实现域适应，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: SAE Debias是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于减少T2I扩散模型中的性别偏见，通过稀疏自编码器识别并抑制性别相关方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决T2I扩散模型中存在的性别偏见问题，特别是职业与性别之间的刻板关联。

Method: 利用预训练的k稀疏自编码器在稀疏潜在空间中识别性别相关方向，并在推理过程中抑制这些方向。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion系列）中显著减少性别偏见，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SAE Debias为构建社会责任的生成AI提供了可解释且模型无关的工具，支持公平的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 挑战现有大语言模型依赖GPU云基础设施的范式，为本地设备设计高效、低资源消耗的模型。

Method: 采用两级稀疏结构（MoE与稀疏前馈网络）、预注意力路由器和NoPE-RoPE混合稀疏注意力机制，优化计算、存储和内存效率。

Result: SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B和SmallThinker-21B-A3B在性能上超越更大模型，并在普通CPU上实现每秒20个令牌的高效推理，内存占用极低。

Conclusion: SmallThinker证明了本地设备上高效运行大语言模型的可行性，减少了对昂贵GPU硬件的依赖。

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用非结构化数据估计个性化治疗效果的方法，通过引入基于神经表示的近似'插件'方法，并进一步提出两种理论基础的估计器以避免混杂偏差，同时针对非代表性子集的采样偏差提出了回归校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖结构化协变量，限制了其在非结构化数据（如医疗领域的临床笔记或医学图像）中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出了一种基于神经表示的近似'插件'方法，并引入两种理论基础的估计器以利用混杂因子的结构化测量，同时针对采样偏差提出了回归校正。

Result: 实验表明，插件方法在大型非结构化数据集上表现优异，尽管其简单。

Conclusion: 该方法为非结构化数据在因果推断中的应用提供了有效解决方案，同时解决了混杂和采样偏差问题。

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器学习模型需要不断更新、组合和选择性撤销，但现有方法存在任务干扰、灾难性遗忘和不可逆等问题。

Method: 将任务特定模型编码为共享基础的增量，并通过正交子空间投影消除冲突，再通过梯度优化合并为统一模型。

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MDM-OC在准确性、反向迁移和撤销保真度上优于现有基线，且内存高效。

Conclusion: MDM-OC为模块化和合规的AI系统设计提供了理论解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNNs）性能强大但缺乏透明性，限制了其在高风险领域的应用。CFNs旨在构建既高性能又可解释的模型。

Method: CFNs通过组合基本数学函数（支持顺序、并行和条件组合模式）构建模型，并利用标准梯度下降进行训练。

Result: CFNs在多个领域（如符号回归和图像分类）表现出色，例如在CIFAR-10上达到96.24%的准确率，优于现有可解释模型。

Conclusion: CFNs结合了深度学习的表达能力和数学函数的可解释性，为需要高性能和透明性的应用提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for

Result: 数值实验表明，改进的FMA能以更少的函数评估获得更低成本的解。

Conclusion: 限制数据集大小能有效提升FMA的优化性能。

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

Result: 在两个基准MI-EEG数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了BFM选择的可扩展性和高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了EEG信号解码中的域适应问题，提升了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer提供了一种新的概率解释，并展示了图扩散步骤的实际有效性。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

Method: Rep-MTL通过表示层任务显著性量化任务间交互，利用熵惩罚和样本级跨任务对齐来减少负迁移并促进互补信息共享。

Result: 在四个多任务学习基准测试中，Rep-MTL即使与基本等权重策略结合，也能取得竞争性性能提升，并通过幂律指数分析验证了其在任务特定学习和跨任务共享间的平衡能力。

Conclusion: Rep-MTL通过表示层操作补充现有优化器，有效减少了负迁移并促进了任务间互补性，在多任务学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

Conclusion: FPO为强化学习提供了一种灵活且高效的流模型策略优化方法，适用于复杂任务和多模态动作分布场景。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison

TL;DR: AutoSign是一种自回归解码器转换器，直接翻译姿态序列为自然语言文本，绕过传统对齐机制，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用1D CNN进行时间压缩处理姿态序列，结合预训练阿拉伯解码器AraGPT2直接生成文本（glosses）。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，AutoSign将WER分数提升了6.1%，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过直接学习特征与glosses之间的映射，避免了传统对齐机制的局限性，显著提升了手语识别的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

*Abdelrahman Mohamed,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS（序列结束）标记的偏见，生成长度更长、细节更丰富的图像描述，无需复杂奖励函数或监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述任务中表现良好，但生成的描述往往简短且缺乏细节。研究发现，这是由于交叉熵训练中引入的对EOS标记的偏见导致的。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，鼓励生成更长的描述。该方法简单且适用于任何预训练模型。

Result: 在三个VLMs和三个详细描述基准测试中，实验结果显示生成的描述长度和细节显著增加，但幻觉率也有所上升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了图像描述任务中描述简短的问题，且无需复杂监督或奖励函数，但需注意幻觉率的增加。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLM）在电子商务中产品属性预测任务中标注成本高的问题，探索如何利用未标记数据提升模型性能。

Method: 采用低秩适配器（PEFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）策略，通过自一致性生成偏好对，迭代微调模型。

Result: 在12个电子商务垂直领域的数据集上，DPO微调显著优于监督模型，且性能随未标记数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用未标记数据实现了高效收敛和性能提升，为标签稀缺场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和独立变异，并在ADNI数据中发现了生物学上合理的协变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Result: 研究发现嘴巴是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提升了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 强调了在ASLR中纳入面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Motivation: 解决颜色视频处理中QSVD计算成本高和四元数矩阵无法有效分离颜色通道的问题，以增强深度模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用四元数黎曼流形降低QSVD复杂度，提出uQRPCA框架平衡目标分割和背景恢复，并通过CR1B方法优化低秩背景。

Result: uQRPCA+在移动目标检测和背景恢复任务中表现优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: uQRPCA+框架高效且性能优越，为颜色视频处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其是对细粒度视觉元素的处理不准确，需要改进。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代优化，实现自我修正和逐步提升预测质量。

Result: $A^2R^2$在六个评估指标上显著优于基线方法，且推理轮次增加带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 实验和人工评估验证了$A^2R^2$的有效性及其核心组件的协同作用。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

<details>

Motivation: 现有融合方法依赖实例提案或密集BEV网格，缺乏全局场景理解或受限于网格结构，需更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用3D高斯分布表示场景，通过FLI初始化高斯位置，IMA融合语义和几何信息，MGF生成多级BEV特征用于检测。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态资源分配和灵活表示，实现了高效且全面的3D目标检测。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，全局模型显著优于单个客户端模型，仅比集中训练模型低2 mIoU。

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效提升了合成到真实语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉-语言Transformer在目标定位任务中的性能，特别是针对语义相关但被抑制的token。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端值并放大中等激活值，重新加权最终层注意力，使语义相关但被抑制的token能够指导预测。

Result: 在15个开源VLM中的11个上，RCA显著提升了FitAP指标，最高提升26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA不仅提高了性能，还增强了多模态Transformer的可解释性，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上表现优于其他先进方法，性能接近全批量方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为DSC提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，尤其适用于大规模预训练编码器的微调。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio

projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Conclusion: TTAL为安全关键应用（如自动驾驶和医疗诊断）提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization

### [299] [FaRMamba: Frequency-based learning and Reconstruction aided Mamba for Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20056)
*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器，解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息缺失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长程结构建模困难等挑战，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能建模全局依赖，但导致局部高频信息缺失和空间结构退化。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）恢复高频信息，自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）恢复空间相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于现有方法，提升了边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

*Ankit Sanjyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的局部提示适应方法（LPA），通过分解提示为内容和风格标记，并在不同阶段选择性注入U-Net的注意力层，提升了文本到图像生成中的布局控制和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂提示下生成图像时缺乏风格一致性和空间连贯性，限制了可控内容生成的实用性。

Method: LPA方法将提示分解为内容和风格标记，并在生成过程的不同阶段选择性注入U-Net的注意力层。

Result: 在50个风格丰富的提示上评估，LPA在CLIP分数和风格一致性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达性强的基于扩散的生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了医学影像数据稀缺问题，提出了一种通过控制特征差异来优化数据池化和数据添加的方法，提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺，数据池化和数据添加虽能提升模型性能，但可能引发分布偏移问题，影响模型表现。

Method: 利用因果框架控制深度网络中前景-背景特征差异，优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集（包括新贡献的超声数据集）上实现了最先进的分割性能，定性结果显示更精细的分割图。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了数据添加困境，提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

TL;DR: NeuroVoxel-LM框架通过动态分辨率体素化和轻量级元嵌入技术，解决了3D语言模型在处理稀疏大规模点云时的效率与精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言模型在稀疏大规模点云上表现不佳，特征提取慢且表示精度有限。

Method: 提出动态分辨率多尺度体素化（DR-MSV）和基于注意力的轻量级元嵌入机制（TAP-LME）。

Result: DR-MSV显著提升了点云特征提取的效率和精度，TAP-LME在捕捉细粒度语义上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM框架有效提升了3D场景感知的语言驱动认知能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）整合视觉数据带来新挑战，数据质量对性能至关重要，需高效过滤方法。

Method: 利用小型VLM对图像和标题质量及对齐性进行评估和过滤，避免额外模块和训练开销。

Result: 过滤后的数据集性能优于或等同于大规模噪声数据，提升图像-文本对齐和标题流畅性。

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM过滤方法为构建高质量视觉语言训练数据提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,
training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely

Motivation: 现实应用（如自动驾驶和人形机器人操作）需要精确的空间感知，但VLMs的空间关系识别能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建合成数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解，并对多种先进VLMs进行实验。

Result: 人类在所有任务中表现近乎完美，而VLMs仅在两个最简单任务中达到人类水平，其余任务表现显著较低，部分任务接近零分。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs的空间理解能力仍有显著提升空间，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算机视觉模型的快速发展，对计算资源的需求不断增加，但在资源受限的环境中部署模型时，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 通过三个方向实现目标：1) 优化数据输入输出；2) 改进核心神经网络架构（如受限注意力机制）；3) 利用标准化流的自然结构。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的神经网络架构可以提高算法效率，使模型更小、更快、更经济。

Conclusion: 通过架构优化，可以在减少计算资源的同时提升模型性能，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉方法在手语数据集中的表情分类表现良好，尤其是在上半脸识别上优于人类，为聋哑人群的情绪研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Conclusion: 论文展示了语义分割在印度驾驶数据集上的有效性，为自动驾驶研究提供了实用参考。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）近年来发展迅速，但在空间推理任务中仍表现不佳，因此需要一种方法来提升其空间推理能力。

Method: SpatialVTS方法分为空间视觉思维和空间文本思维两个阶段：前者生成与位置相关的特定标记，后者基于视觉线索和对话进行长期推理。同时，对数据集进行了人工修正和格式重构。

Result: 在不引入额外信息（如掩码或深度）的情况下，模型在多个空间理解任务中的平均表现显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: SpatialVTS方法通过视觉和文本双重思维有效提升了空间推理能力，为VQA和机器人技术提供了更强大的基础能力。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的人工智能变得至关重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性，影响了可靠性。

Method: 通过量化目标与偏差特征的线性相关性（协方差矩阵），利用白化模块消除这些相关性。该方法无需正则化项或对抗学习，避免了优化不稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过调整加权系数，有效平衡了算法效用与公平性，同时简化了实现过程。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感、需要反复优化且缺乏明确反馈的问题，同时避免现有技术需要额外训练或可控性有限的限制。

Method: 系统包含三个代理：输入解析器（解析和标准化提示）、生成引擎（选择模型并组织生成）、质量评估器（评估生成质量并提供反馈）。

Result: 在开源模型上，T2I-Copilot的VQA分数接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%且性能提升6.17%，优于其他开源模型。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作实现了高效、低成本的文本到图像生成，支持全自动和人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要额外先验信息（如说话者类别标签或3D面部网格）的问题，以更实用地反映说话风格。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1阶段存储和检索通用运动（记忆），2阶段通过音频驱动的说话风格特征进行个性化面部运动合成（动画）。

Result: MemoryTalker无需额外先验信息即可生成可靠的个性化面部动画，定量、定性评估及用户研究均显示其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker在仅需音频输入的情况下，实现了逼真且准确的3D面部动画合成，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐地面真实数据最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致动画抖动和不自然。

Method: 提出了一种新的语音上下文感知损失，通过引入音素协同发音权重，根据时间动态变化为面部运动分配自适应重要性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在语音驱动的3D面部动画合成中，显式建模语音上下文依赖音素的重要性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

TL;DR: SparseVAR是一种无需额外训练的加速框架，通过动态排除低频token减少计算开销，保持图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分辨率阶段中低频token对图像质量影响小且相似度高，计算开销大。

Method: 使用轻量级MSE指标识别低频token，保留锚点token维持区域保真度。

Result: 在Infinity-2B中实现2倍加速，质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR高效减少计算成本，适用于高分辨率图像生成。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

*Ao Li,Yuxiang Duan,Jinghui Zhang,Congbo Ma,Yutong Xie,Gustavo Carneiro,Mohammad Yaqub,Hu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的令牌修剪方法TransPrune，通过令牌转移变化和指令引导注意力提高推理效率，性能接近原始LVLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因视觉令牌数量多导致计算成本高，现有基于注意力的方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），需探索新视角。

Method: 提出TransPrune方法，结合令牌转移变化（TTV）和指令引导注意力（IGA）评估令牌重要性，逐步修剪。

Result: 在八个基准测试中性能接近原始LVLMs（如LLaVA-v1.5），推理TFLOPs减少一半以上，TTV单独使用效果媲美基于注意力的方法。

Conclusion: TransPrune是一种高效且无需训练的令牌修剪方法，显著提升推理效率，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at
https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测玩家移动对游戏中的机器人导航、策略推荐等应用至关重要，但复杂环境和玩家互动增加了建模难度。

Method: 采用U-Net架构生成终点位置概率热图，结合多模态特征编码器和多头注意力机制处理异构数据。

Result: 该架构能有效利用图像、数值和动态数据，为预测玩家位置提供基础。

Conclusion: 该技术为机器人行为预测和异常检测等任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Method: 采用多掩码查询网络（MMQ-Net），整合模态查询、类别查询和干扰查询机制，分别用于数据重建、情感特征提取和噪声分离。

Conclusion: MMQ-Net通过多查询机制有效解决了生理数据情感识别中的关键问题，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from
incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and
interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data
incompleteness.

TL;DR: ReSoRA提出了一种自适应正则化低秩适应子空间冗余的方法，通过显式建模和约束特征分布，提升了参数高效迁移学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法在训练中投影矩阵不受限制，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降，缺乏灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: ReSoRA将低秩子矩阵分解为多个等效子空间，并系统地对不同投影间的特征分布应用去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明，ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上提升了现有PETL方法的性能，且无需额外推理成本。

Conclusion: ReSoRA作为一种训练监督方法，可无缝集成到现有方法中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为远程、非接触式检测多个密封容器液位提供了首个解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Motivation: 探讨合成数据是否能在人脸识别系统中同时实现高准确性和公平性。

Method: 使用Flux.1-dev和Stable Diffusion v3.5生成平衡数据集FairFaceGen，结合多种身份增强方法，并在标准数据集上评估性能和偏见。

Result: 合成数据在IJB-B/C上泛化能力不及真实数据，但SD35生成的平衡数据集显示出减少偏见的潜力。

Conclusion: 合成数据在公平性上有潜力，但需优化增强方法以提高准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病影响全球超过5500万人，现有诊断方法无法同时满足准确性、泛化性、鲁棒性和可解释性的临床需求。

Method: OmniBrain整合多种数据模态（脑MRI、放射组学、基因表达、临床数据），采用交叉注意力和模态丢弃技术构建统一模型。

Conclusion: OmniBrain为阿尔茨海默病的实际诊断提供了鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Motivation: 解决计算病理学中模型因扫描仪差异导致的性能不一致问题，这对实际临床应用至关重要。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个用5台扫描仪扫描）和SimCons框架（结合增强技术和一致性损失）。

Result: SimCons提高了模型在不同扫描仪下的一致性，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: SCORPION和SimCons为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的关键资源，设定了可靠性测试的新标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD通过冻结预训练参数，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时显著提升了伪造检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled

multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLM容易受到有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 引入安全张量，通过文本或视觉模态在推理时应用可训练输入向量，无需修改模型参数。优化数据集包含恶意、对比性和一般良性样本。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLM拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时保持对良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全张量成功激活语言模块的文本“安全层”，将文本安全扩展到视觉模态。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

Motivation: 随着DeFi的发展，区分用户行为（流动性提供与主动交易）对风险建模和链上声誉至关重要。

Method: 采用规则分解行为特征（如交易量、频率、持有时间等），并结合深度残差神经网络处理边缘情况和特征交互，同时引入池级上下文（如TVL、费用层级等）。

Result: 实验证明该框架在Uniswap v3数据上有效，支持用户分群和协议对齐的声誉系统。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了上下文感知和可扩展的DeFi用户评分，有助于改进风险评估和激励设计。

Abstract: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user
behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for
risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring
framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity
Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap
Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and
discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that
decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal
patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a
deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the
U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value
locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate
similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework
enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk
assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its
usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems.
Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and
methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et
al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using
blueprint logic and supervised learning.

Method: 提出两种调优方法：Method A（顺序优化）和Method B（基于初始评估的优先级优化）。

Result: Method A提升1.47倍，Method B提升1.65倍。

Conclusion: 算法组合方法有效提升了CIMs中超参数调优的效率。

Abstract: Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have recently gained attention as a promising
computing model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In particular,
the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution
quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of
hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present
an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing
Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method
incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective
adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we
propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A
optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials,
while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before
applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the
Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and
Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline
performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x
improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing
the tuning process for CIMs.

Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a
continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a
noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response
equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional
analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von
Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective
regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions
and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding
index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential
depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for
convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory
yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and
uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies,
and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability
phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous
mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the
utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接解决SF-LQ和DFT-LQ问题的方法，避免了惩罚方法的缺点，如参数调整困难和虚假驻点问题。通过重新表述问题并采用ADMM算法，实现了理论保证的群稀疏反馈增益设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 惩罚方法在解决DFT-LQ和SF-LQ问题时存在参数调整困难和虚假驻点的缺点，本文旨在直接解决这些问题，避免惩罚方法的局限性。

Method: 首先从epi-composition函数角度重新表述SF-LQ和DFT-LQ问题，然后采用ADMM算法，并在理论层面分析其收敛性。若假设不成立，则结合次梯度下降和DC松弛方法。

Result: 实现了直接设计群稀疏反馈增益的理论保证，无需依赖凸替代、限制性结构假设或惩罚公式。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效解决了惩罚方法的缺点，为群稀疏反馈增益设计提供了直接且理论可靠的途径。

Abstract: This work is a companion paper of [8], where the distributed linear-quadratic
problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ
problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization
problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in
\cite{feng-part1}, and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization)
algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper,
we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the
challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious
stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the
DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve
the constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we
revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish
its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When
these assumptions do not hold, we can effectively utilize alternative
approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation
methods. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions, or penalty formulations that
incorporate constraints into the cost function.

*Yu-Jui Huang,Zachariah Malik*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于密度依赖温度的Langevin扩散方法，用于非凸优化，通过自调节的随机扰动更好地适应局部极小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非凸优化中，传统的Langevin扩散方法可能无法有效应对复杂的优化地形，因此需要一种能够根据密度动态调整温度的方法。

Method: 引入密度依赖温度的Langevin扩散，形成自调节的均值场随机微分方程（SDE），并通过Wasserstein次微分分析证明其Fokker-Planck方程的唯一解。

Result: 证明了SDE的弱解存在性，并显示其密度随时间收敛到一个显式表达的Lambert W函数形式的稳态分布。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自调节机制有效应对非凸优化问题，为复杂优化地形提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a
Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The
rationale is that the induced density reveals to some extent the landscape
imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a
density-dependent temperature can provide location-wise random perturbation
that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local
minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density,
it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii
type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on
Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding
(nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution
to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by
Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show
that the density induced by the SDE converges to an invariant distribution,
which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function.

Motivation: 现有方法假设数据流形平滑，无法处理多义词嵌入空间的几何奇异点，导致表示不稳定。

Result: 证明了新空间的几何正则化定理，解决了原始病理问题。

Conclusion: 建议从静态查找转向动态几何计算的新范式。

Abstract: Recent work has provided compelling evidence challenging the foundational
manifold hypothesis for the token embedding spaces of Large Language Models
(LLMs). These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around
polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing
methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to
address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this
problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by
applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure
replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional
divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space
of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token.
This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new
geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the
geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original
pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of
our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic,
geometrically-grounded computation.

TL;DR: CleANN系统解决了动态图索引在更新和查询质量上的问题，通过三种创新组件实现了高效的并发操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图索引在数据更新时存在查询质量下降或更新成本高的问题，需要一种高效且质量稳定的解决方案。

Method: CleANN包含三种组件：工作负载感知链接、查询自适应邻域整合和半惰性内存清理。

Result: 在7个数据集上，CleANN在完全动态工作负载下保持了与静态索引相当的查询质量，并实现了7-1200倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: CleANN是首个在完全动态环境下保持高效和查询质量的并发ANNS索引。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential
algorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.
Graph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,
query efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based
indexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the
data after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,
deletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in
applications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently
supports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based
indexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query
quality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to
maintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve
these problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main
components: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to
combat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood
consolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory
cleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the
work spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse
datasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at
least as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding
data. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of
queries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x
throughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency
while maintaining quality under full dynamism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界网络中的边通常带有时间戳，需要时间模体挖掘来分析复杂网络行为，但现有算法难以处理大规模时间模体计数问题。

Method: TIMEST采用时间生成树采样器和加权采样技术，结合随机估计方法，高效计算时间模体数量。

Result: TIMEST在实验中表现出色，比现有算法快28倍（与GPU精确算法相比）和6倍（与近似算法相比），误差通常低于5%。

Conclusion: TIMEST为时间模体计数提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，适用于金融欺诈等实际应用场景。

Abstract: The mining of pattern subgraphs, known as motifs, is a core task in the field
of graph mining. Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there
is a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure
that imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have
been used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological
networks.
  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with
millions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge
can occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of
possibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more
than four vertices.
  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation
algorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our
approach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted
sampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method
carefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be
jointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques
to obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.
  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation
guarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show
that TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU
implementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU
implementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate
algorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For
example, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal
motif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two
days.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词的数据增强方法生成的声音不真实，且依赖人工标签；高级音频生成模型需要异常训练数据，限制了其适用性。

Method: 利用LLM解析故障文本描述，自动选择音频转换函数，将正常机器声音转换为多样且合理的异常声音。

Result: 实验表明，合成异常与真实异常在检测难度上趋势一致，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成方法为UASD系统的相对评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies
to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection
(UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real
anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often
produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels,
limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced
audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend
on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous
examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual
descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions,
converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds.
We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal
sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data.
Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty
across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding
supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.

Motivation: 现有视频到音乐生成方法仅依赖视觉特征或文本输入，生成过程不透明且难以满足用户需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段通过细粒度特征选择和渐进时间对齐机制实现灵活特征对齐；第二阶段通过动态条件融合模块和控制引导解码器整合多条件并精确指导音乐生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于现有方法，显著提升了控制性和用户期望对齐。

Conclusion: 多条件引导框架有效解决了现有方法的不足，为视频到音乐生成提供了更高控制性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic
video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely
on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a
black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework
that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over
music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables
learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while
meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we
introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal
alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the
second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a
control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately
guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective
evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user
expectations.

Result: 实验表明ChoreoMuse在视频质量、节奏对齐、舞蹈多样性和风格一致性上达到领先水平。

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse为广泛创意应用提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,
environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an
assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain

for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

*Matin Aghaei,Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Mahdi Biparva*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究发现，在目标导航任务中，几何启发式方法（DWFE）比大型语言模型（LLM）更能提升性能，而轻量级语言先验（SHF）进一步优化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在目标导航任务中的实际贡献，验证几何启发式方法的有效性。

Method: 移除InstructNav的复杂组件，替换为简单的几何启发式方法（DWFE）和轻量级语言先验（SHF），并在HM3D-v1数据集上测试。

Result: DWFE将成功率从58.0%提升至61.1%，SPL从20.9%提升至36.0%；SHF进一步优化路径。

Conclusion: 几何启发式是性能提升的主要驱动力，LLM的贡献有限，需进一步优化提示或语义图才能体现其价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Motivation: 室内环境（如长直走廊）会导致SLAM严重的退化问题，传统监督学习方法存在数据获取瓶颈、样本质量下降和标注协议设计模糊等挑战。

Method: 使用PPO训练DOA，设计奖励函数引导代理感知退化环境，动态调整传感器贡献，并通过迁移学习实现跨环境泛化。

Conclusion: 提出的DOA能有效解决SLAM退化问题，具有跨环境泛化能力，为室内定位任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 本研究为LLM在自动控制领域的应用开辟了新方向，具有更高的实用性和部署潜力。

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.

Result: 仿真和真实实验中，该方法优于基线，展示了多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为四足机器人提供了高效的多任务交互能力。

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to

designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,
tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF
identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest

deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated
LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p
< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in
tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced
autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential
for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative
potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species
management and improved environmental outcomes.

Conclusion: 新框架为自动驾驶与行人交互提供了更现实的动态模拟和决策支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Result: 在12个真实网络中，1D-CGS在排名准确性和运行速度上显著优于传统方法和深度学习基线。

Conclusion: 1D-CGS是一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于大规模网络应用。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a
wide range of applications across different domains. However, existing
approaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
To address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective
hybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural
networks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for
efficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built
on two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and
average neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions
to extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate
neighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression
problem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate
ground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic
networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world
networks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve
real world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms
traditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking
accuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an
average improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard
Similarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves
an average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank
distributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.
Furthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly
reasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning
methods, making it suitable for large scale applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open
Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS),
where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient
processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies
between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge
servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission
dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle
cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.
First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,
namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline
for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double
Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and
multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment
time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations
reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall
benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN
achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and
12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient
task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance
parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the
Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the
increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex,
large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for
optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm,
inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for
parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This
study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP
framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts,
scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and
strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to
rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer
insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable
references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking
forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies
at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and
optimization.

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex,
with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance
computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across
nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling
and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks
such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support
diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling
algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable
algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling
algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across
six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are
capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require
significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.
Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less
exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a
specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based
learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling
algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP
applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling
optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study
successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with
confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of
data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework
to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision
and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where
the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this
work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel
self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral
continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a
model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging
global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training
strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the
factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and
joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled
samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19,
significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our
results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task
for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant
challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In
this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features
from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based
embeddings. Using the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we benchmark our ResNet-50 baseline
(AUC: 78.1%) and demonstrate that fusing handcrafted features with deep
ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak
recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our
experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep
representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based
embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and
computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for
clinical decision support.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同架构中的一致性改进，并在竞赛中获得第一名。

Conclusion: 输入空间标准化是解决多机构医学影像域偏移的鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair
cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining
Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling
(KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain
robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space
standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and
cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and
temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping
disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment
mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network
optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements
across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself.
The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a
competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and
practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Method: 通过领域特定的LoRA微调和多目标损失函数联合优化，使Stable Diffusion-2.0能一步生成临床相关图像和分割掩码。

Result: 合成图像质量接近真实图像（FID验证），混合数据集显著提升模型性能（准确率和F1-score提高8%-15%）。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像数据挑战提供了可扩展解决方案，提升了罕见疾病诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of
diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class
imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We
propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model
to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding
segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification
and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of
multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate
clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual
descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated
images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A
hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the
performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial
improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive
gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach
offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data,
contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于正弦激活的深度学习模型，用于恢复稀疏和带宽受限的3D光声断层扫描（3D-PAT）数据，通过简化训练策略和模拟数据，提高了图像质量和带宽恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D-PAT中因传感器稀疏和带宽受限导致的图像质量下降问题。

Method: 引入正弦激活的深度学习模型，结合随机球形吸收体模拟数据进行训练，以恢复宽带光声射频（PARF）信号。

Result: 模型在多种测试中表现良好，显著提高了高频内容恢复能力，减少了伪影，并实现了2体积/秒的快速成像。

Conclusion: 正弦激活模型结合简化训练策略，有效提升了3D-PAT的图像质量和实用性。

Abstract: 3D photoacoustic tomography (3D-PAT) using high-frequency hemispherical
transducers offers near-omnidirectional reception and enhanced sensitivity to
the finer structural details encoded in the high-frequency components of the
broadband photoacoustic (PA) signal. However, practical constraints such as
limited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in
sparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we
revisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA
radio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into
the DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed
band-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training
data, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical
absorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is
designed to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model
was evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom
and in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed
training mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the
different tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the
spatiotemporal bandwidth. Qualitatively, the sine-activated model uniquely
enhanced high-frequency content that produces clearer vascular structure with
fewer artefacts. Quantitatively, the sine-activated model exhibits full
bandwidth at -12 dB spectrum and significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio
with minimal loss of structural similarity index. Lastly, we optimized our
approach to enable fast enhanced 3D-PAT at 2 volumes-per-second for better
practical imaging of a free-moving targets.

Motivation: 开发神经影像生物标志物以预测精神和神经疾病的行为变量，需要提取合适的特征。

Method: 比较了九种特征子类型（包括功能活动区域测量、功能连接和GSP衍生指标）在行为预测中的表现，研究了样本量和扫描时间的影响。

Result: FC在预测认知、年龄和性别方面表现最佳；GSP和变异性特征在某些情况下也有潜力。样本量和扫描时间的平衡对预测性能至关重要。

Conclusion: FC是行为预测的稳健特征，但GSP和变异性特征也值得关注。未来研究应考虑数据采集和样本构成的策略。

Abstract: Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of
neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial
processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can
differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction
scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes
extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction,
ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional
connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a
principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional
features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult
dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing
speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the
features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan
time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex.
Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and
age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When
predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the
simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The
scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing
features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and
scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as
a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP
and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future
prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample
composition.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in
near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve
cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep
learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel
estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and
utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of
channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba
architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This
network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural
advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of
local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach
with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover,
sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel
estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

Motivation: 甲基苯丙胺依赖的评估和治疗效果常依赖主观报告，存在不确定性；现有神经影像技术（如EEG和fNIRS）因各自局限和传统特征提取方法可靠性不足。

Method: 提出NeuroCLIP框架，通过渐进学习策略整合EEG和fNIRS数据，生成可靠生物标志物。

Result: NeuroCLIP显著优于单模态模型，能客观评估rTMS疗效，且与心理测量验证的渴求分数强相关。

Conclusion: NeuroCLIP提供更稳健可靠的生物标志物，对成瘾神经科学研究和临床评估有重要价值。

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet
its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which
may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on
conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the
reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded
EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach
offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.
Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves
discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and
healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.
Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based
evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in
neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,
we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by
showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.
These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP
offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,
providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially
improving clinical assessments.

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring
respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled
healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely
studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in
children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental
changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of
respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches
tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid
CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an
attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using
scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our
model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and
0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to
address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of
0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores
outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This
approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease
diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a
critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code
assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to
privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose
PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation,

domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and
computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in

device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously
evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset,
achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the

Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to
instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing
invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a
promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from
high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware
noise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning
framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application
focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn
the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial
memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a
compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data
storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw
simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then
incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such
as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical
fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent
channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior
performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This
hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems
using near-term quantum hardware.

Motivation: 随着ZS-TTS技术的快速发展，高保真语音合成引发了隐私和伦理问题。目前缺乏从预训练模型参数中选择性移除特定说话人知识的研究。

Method: 提出了TGU框架，通过引入随机性防止遗忘说话人声音的复制，并设计了新的评估指标spk-ZRF。

Result: 实验表明，TGU能有效阻止模型复制遗忘说话人的声音，同时保持对其他说话人的高质量语音生成。

Conclusion: TGU为ZS-TTS系统的说话人身份遗忘提供了有效解决方案，解决了隐私和伦理问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has
enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy,
research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual
voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,
we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.
To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for
ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the
model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to
generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate
randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,
assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a
new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses
the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers,
effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments
conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model
from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for
other speakers. The demo is available at https://speechunlearn.github.io/

Motivation: 零样本音频分类依赖文本描述生成嵌入，但文本描述对多样声音类别的准确性有限。

Method: 通过将音频嵌入按类别分组并处理，替代噪声文本嵌入。

Result: 少样本分类通常优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 少样本方法在音频分类中具有潜力，能有效提升准确性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art audio classification often employs a zero-shot approach,
which involves comparing audio embeddings with embeddings from text describing
the respective audio class. These embeddings are usually generated by neural
networks trained through contrastive learning to align audio and text
representations. Identifying the optimal text description for an audio class is
challenging, particularly when the class comprises a wide variety of sounds.
This paper examines few-shot methods designed to improve classification
accuracy beyond the zero-shot approach. Specifically, audio embeddings are
grouped by class and processed to replace the inherently noisy text embeddings.
Our results demonstrate that few-shot classification typically outperforms the
zero-shot baseline.

Motivation: 现有CNN模型难以捕捉全局上下文，而Transformer模型计算成本高，需要一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: 结合CNN和轻量级自注意力机制，引入FBS模块抑制噪声和非信息频率区域，并开发年龄特异性模型。

Result: 在SPRSound和ICBHI数据集上达到新基准，计算量减少50%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CNN-TSA框架适合资源受限环境下的实时呼吸音分析，FBS模块可作为通用增强手段。

Abstract: Accurate classification of respiratory sounds requires deep learning models
that effectively capture fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal
dependencies. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for
extracting local time-frequency patterns but are limited in modeling global
context. In contrast, transformer-based models can capture long-range
dependencies, albeit with higher computational demands. To address these
limitations, we propose a compact CNN-Temporal Self-Attention (CNN-TSA) network
that integrates lightweight self-attention into an efficient CNN backbone.
Central to our approach is a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) module that
suppresses noisy and non-informative frequency regions, substantially improving
accuracy and reducing FLOPs by up to 50%. We also introduce age-specific models
to enhance robustness across diverse patient groups. Evaluated on the
SPRSound-2022/2023 and ICBHI-2017 lung sound datasets, CNN-TSA with FBS sets
new benchmarks on SPRSound and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI,
all with a significantly smaller computational footprint. Furthermore,
integrating FBS into an existing transformer baseline yields a new record on
ICBHI, confirming FBS as an effective drop-in enhancement. These results
demonstrate that our framework enables reliable, real-time respiratory sound
analysis suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: JAM是一种基于流匹配的歌词到歌曲生成模型，首次实现了单词级时间和持续时间的控制，并通过美学对齐优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词到歌曲生成模型缺乏音乐工作流程中所需的细粒度单词级控制，且生成质量有待提升。

Method: 采用流匹配技术实现单词级控制，并通过直接偏好优化（DPO）进行美学对齐，无需人工标注数据。

Result: JAM在音乐特定属性上优于现有模型，并通过公开数据集JAME标准化评估。

Conclusion: JAM为歌词到歌曲生成提供了更精细的控制和更高的生成质量，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic
text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable
of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and
acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative
audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open
lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an
acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However,
these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by
musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our
flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing
and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control.
To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human
preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference
Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset,
eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to
standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public
evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in
terms of the music-specific attributes.

TL;DR: Music Arena是一个开放平台，用于通过用户偏好评估文本到音乐（TTM）模型，提供标准化、透明的评估方法和音乐特定功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TTM领域缺乏开放、可比较的人类偏好数据的问题，同时帮助研究人员改进模型和自动评估指标。

Method: 通过实时用户输入文本提示并比较两个TTM系统的输出，收集偏好数据，包括详细反馈和隐私保护的数据发布政策。

Result: Music Arena提供了一个标准化的评估协议和透明的数据访问政策，填补了TTM生态系统的关键空白。

Conclusion: Music Arena不仅解决了TTM领域的挑战，还展示了如何针对特定AI领域的特点进行实时评估。

Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference
evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via
listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies
are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may
differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align
their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and
renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these
gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users
input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,
and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena
follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with
key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the
heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*
preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also
propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a
renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.
Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,
and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in
the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully
adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在战略互动中的行为，发现其与人类行为存在显著差异，并提出了一种基于经济推理的监督微调方法，以对齐LLM的经济偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地自主参与经济和道德决策，理解其在战略互动中的行为变得至关重要。

Method: 使用经典经济游戏评估LLM偏好，提出基于合成数据集的监督微调方法，以对齐两种经济偏好结构（homo economicus和homo moralis）。

Result: 微调后，LLM行为更接近目标经济代理，并在自动驾驶道德困境和市场竞争定价中展示了不同规范性目标的影响。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种可复制、高效且基于经济原则的方法，用于对齐AI偏好，为经济和道德决策提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic
interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate
autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate
LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations
from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited
incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more
consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised
fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic
reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two
stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on
individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of
Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).
We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior
toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned
agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous
vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples
illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from
structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This
work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded
pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

Motivation: 利用反应时间数据提高偏好参数估计的准确性和预测能力。

Result: 在跨期选择实验中验证了方法的有效性，表明反应时间的使用提高了预测准确性并对经济相关参数的估计有重要影响。

Conclusion: 反应时间数据在偏好参数估计中具有重要价值，能够提升模型的预测能力和参数估计的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a general methodology for recovering preference parameters from
data on choices and response times. Our methods yield estimates with fast
($1/n$ for $n$ data points) convergence rates when specialized to the popular
Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), but are broadly applicable to generalizations of
the DDM as well as to alternative models of decision making that make use of
response time data. The paper develops an empirical application to an
experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times
delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically
relevant parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持急性护理环境中的知识表示和临床推理，以改善呼吸支持治疗的标准化和一致性。

Method: 使用OWL语义和Protege开发NIRS本体，添加SWRL规则支持逻辑推理，并通过17个假设患者场景和eICU数据库数据进行验证。

Result: 本体包含132个类、12个对象属性和17个数据属性，SPARQL查询成功验证了所有测试案例。

Conclusion: NIRS本体成功统一了领域概念，支持规则推理和治疗建议，为临床数据模型集成和高级分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology to
support knowledge representation in acute care settings.
  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology
Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and
relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical
structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated
logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used
SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)
Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data
properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To
standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive
definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully
validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,
for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours
due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,
including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,
and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the
ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy
recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,
integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.
  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and
demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient
scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.

Subsequently, we survey various PPI predictor types, including traditional
similarity-based approaches, and deep learning-based approaches with a
particular emphasis on the transformer architecture. Finally, we provide
examples of PPI prediction in systems-level proteomics analyses, target
identification, and design of therapeutic peptides and antibodies. We also take

Method: 使用1,664个用户设备和6个基站位置的实测数据，系统调整模拟参数（如路径深度、天线属性等），并通过Spearman相关性和kNN定位算法评估模拟效果。

Result: 天线位置和方向对模拟精度影响显著，优化后Spearman相关性提升5%至130%，kNN定位误差减少三分之一。

Conclusion: 精确的几何和天线模型是必要的，但捕捉城市环境中的残余噪声仍是高保真室外射频模拟的挑战。

Abstract: We study the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links
in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs)
and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we
systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth,
diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's
properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator
fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between
measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor
localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments,
solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On
the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple
greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for
various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated
data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while
staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and
credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully
capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable,
high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

Motivation: 传统网络指标（如延迟和数据包丢失）无法满足现代智能应用对信息质量的复杂需求，因此需要新的度量标准。

Method: 通过引入一个系统化的四维分类框架（时间、质量/效用、可靠性/鲁棒性、网络/通信维度），分析信息指标的相互依赖关系。

Result: 研究发现人工智能技术（如深度强化学习）能够优化信息质量目标，并在六个关键应用领域中展示了多维信息指标的潜力。

Conclusion: 多维信息指标对满足多样化操作需求具有革命性意义，但仍面临显著的实现挑战。

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted
from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs
that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information,
rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency
and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the
nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications,
including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In
this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of
Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic
framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility,
reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the
increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness
triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal,
ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that
artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning,
multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive,
context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our
extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous
transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications,
LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise
of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.

Motivation: 现有合成流量数据方法难以捕捉复杂时空模式，导致生成的流量数据与真实数据相似度不足，影响机器学习模型的检测效果。

Method: 采用双流结构：场流通过空间映射将网络数据特征与预训练的稳定扩散模型结合；时空流动态建模网络流量的时间模式。

Result: 实验表明，生成的数据在统计上与真实数据更相似，并能显著提升下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: DSTF-Diffusion能有效生成高质量合成流量数据，为DDoS攻击检测提供更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research
efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose
effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To
address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces
is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle
to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in
emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces
and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we
propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view,
multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models,
featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge
network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion
models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that
stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic
temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal
patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data
generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals
compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a
wide range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 6G网络中支持原生AI是重要目标，联邦学习（FL）因其隐私保护特性成为有前景的范式，但数据异构性和频繁客户端参与带来挑战。

Method: 提出FedABC算法，基于注意力机制评估客户端对全局模型的贡献，并通过优化问题动态调整客户端选择阈值。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的实验显示，FedABC比现有方法表现更优，模型精度更高且客户端参与效率显著提升。

Conclusion: FedABC为在异构、资源受限环境中部署联邦学习提供了有效解决方案，支持6G网络的原生AI能力。

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with
Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows
decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly
sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private
data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the
global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data
heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client
participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection
algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and
optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms,
\textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model
similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover,
considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an
optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process.
Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts
the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later
training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that
\textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy
and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\%
fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher
accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a
step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments,
thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for
inverse materials design. Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential
chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to
chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator
with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical
rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a
transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced
compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The
valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence
checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When
fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability
and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of
functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal
conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as
a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative
pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically
grounded path for materials discovery.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a
fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In
this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that
combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative
evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate
that domain specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance
the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task
of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data which is a
key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By
aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as
those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training
ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally
leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为动态一致的期望提供了数学基础，并通过Feynman-Kac公式与完全非线性PDE建立了联系。

Abstract: The canonical theory of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, founded on
sub-additivity, is insensitive to non-convex uncertainty structures, leading to
an identifiability impasse. This paper develops a mathematical framework for an
identifiable calculus sensitive to non-convex geometry. We introduce the
$\theta$-BSDE, a class of backward stochastic differential equations where the
driver is determined by a pointwise maximization over a primitive, possibly
non-convex, uncertainty set. The system's tractability is predicated not on
convexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and
globally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this
hypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish
well-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically
regular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under
non-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique
along any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify
the fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global
regularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator
defines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection
to fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.

interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents
has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex
investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present
\textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading
that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and
generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news,
candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial
reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment
recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A
central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to
continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time
report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment
strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches
technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow
signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment
framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

### [386] [A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Microphysical Properties of Ice Crystals from Cloud Particle Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19759)
*Joseph Ko,Jerry Harrington,Kara Sulia,Vanessa Przybylo,Marcus van Lier-Walqui,Kara Lamb*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，从二维图像预测冰晶的三维微物理特性，包括有效密度、有效表面积和子弹数量，并通过合成数据验证了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰晶的微物理特性对云的辐射特性和分布有重要影响，进而影响地球气候，但直接测量这些特性具有挑战性。

Method: 使用3D建模软件生成合成冰晶，并利用机器学习模型从二维图像预测三维特性，测试了单视角和双视角模型的性能。

Result: 单视角模型在预测有效密度和有效表面积时R²值分别为0.99和0.98，子弹数量的平衡准确率和F1分数为0.91；双视角模型进一步提升了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该研究为从原位图像估计冰晶微物理特性提供了新的机器学习框架，有助于改进微物理参数化模型。

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

*Nicola Croce,Tobin South*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文揭示了MCP协议的安全漏洞，展示了一种低门槛的攻击方式，利用MCP的信任模型窃取敏感金融数据，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MCP协议在AI工具集成中的安全风险，特别是其信任模型可能被低技术攻击者利用的问题。

Method: 通过概念验证攻击，展示恶意MCP服务器如何伪装成合法功能，利用银行工具窃取用户数据。

Result: 发现MCP生态系统中存在严重安全漏洞，攻击门槛极低，普通编程技能即可实施。

Conclusion: 当前MCP实现易受跨服务器攻击，需立即采取缓解措施并改进协议以增强安全性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in
AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and
external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors
that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated
threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can
exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a
proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as
benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal
user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical
knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a
critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers
may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server
attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume
sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for
MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level
Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit
the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool
providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by
demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server
attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to
secure this emerging ecosystem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI数据空间中隐私、性能与政策合规的挑战。

Method: 综述了联邦学习、差分隐私等技术，并提出分类法。

Result: 分析了性能指标，识别了研究缺口，并提出了未来方向。

Conclusion: 为开发可信、高效且合规的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: As AI-driven dataspaces become integral to data sharing and collaborative
analytics, ensuring privacy, performance, and policy compliance presents
significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated
Learning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic
Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation, alongside strategies for
aligning AI with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act. We
propose a novel taxonomy to classify these techniques based on privacy levels,
performance impacts, and compliance complexity, offering a clear framework for
practitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics
-- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and
explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization
required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including
the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI
for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory
fragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework
for policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized
benchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and
Eclipse EDC. By synthesizing technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives,
this work lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy, efficient, and
compliant AI systems in dataspaces, fostering innovation in secure and
responsible data-driven ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hot-Swap MarkBoard的高效水印方法，用于保护大规模分布式设备上的深度学习模型知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型在终端设备上的部署增加，模型的知识产权保护面临更大风险，现有水印方法无法满足大规模分发场景的需求。

Method: 通过在多分支低秩适应（LoRA）模块中独立嵌入多个水印，实现高效定制化水印，无需重新训练，支持黑盒验证。

Result: 在多种任务和模型上验证了方法的有效性，实现了100%的验证准确率。

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard是一种高效、适应性强的水印方法，适用于大规模模型分发场景。

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: DynamiX是一个新型大规模社交网络模拟器，专注于动态社交网络建模，通过动态层次模块和特定用户类型的社交关系建模策略，显著提升了态度演化和集体行为分析的模拟效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注扩大代理群体规模，忽视了社交关系的动态演化，因此需要一种能够准确模拟现实世界中用户角色自适应切换和社交关系动态变化的工具。

Method: DynamiX采用动态层次模块选择核心代理，并为不同用户类型设计动态社交关系建模策略：对意见领袖使用基于信息流的链接预测方法，对普通用户使用不平等导向的行为决策模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，DynamiX在态度演化和集体行为分析方面优于静态网络，并为意见领袖培养提供了新的理论视角和实证证据。

Conclusion: DynamiX填补了动态社交网络建模的空白，为社交平台机制研究提供了有效工具，并展示了在模拟和预测方面的显著优势。

Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent
demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides
significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude
dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly
focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of
social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel
large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network
modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents
with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of
real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct
dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For
opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method
recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous
connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we
construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively
addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of
relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental
results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude
evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static
networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower
growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders
cultivation.

Method: 使用密度、连通性和空间配置等结构指标，结合无监督学习对城市形态分类，并通过统计方法分析其与交通行为的关系。

Result: 不同城市形态显著影响交通选择，如网状形态与公共交通使用增加（边际效应0.49）和汽车依赖减少（-0.41）相关。

Conclusion: 城市形态是交通规划的关键变量，研究为可持续城市规划提供了分类框架和实证依据。

Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility,
yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan
areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and
advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built
environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as
density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological
types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal
effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that
distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility
behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher
public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence
(-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44),
and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility
(-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19), highlighting that
the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping
transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a
reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added
value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results
suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility
planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies
into sustainable urban policy design.

all those generalized Legendre transforms on functions correspond to the

That is, generalized convex conjugates are convex conjugates of affine-deformed
functions. We conclude this note by sketching how this result can be
interpreted from the lens of information geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的解决方案，用于预测和管理用户中心化无蜂窝大规模MIMO（UC-mMIMO）网络中移动用户的连接切换（HO），以减少频繁切换带来的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在UC-mMIMO网络中，用户移动性导致频繁的切换操作，带来资源分配和释放的开销。本文旨在通过DRL技术优化切换策略，平衡用户速率和切换开销。

Method: 采用Soft Actor-Critic算法，设计了连续动作空间的切换策略，并提出了结合切换惩罚的奖励函数。开发了两种系统变体：基于用户移动模式的DA观测和基于大尺度衰落历史的HA观测。

Result: 仿真结果表明，连续动作空间的DRL方法比离散空间更具扩展性，且切换策略能自动学习在特定时隙集中切换以最小化开销。系统响应时间小于0.4毫秒。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DRL方法有效减少了UC-mMIMO网络中切换操作的开销，同时保持了用户速率，且具备实时操作能力。

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.

Motivation: 当前HCI研究过于关注AI艺术的检测和自动化，忽视了艺术价值源于人类创作过程中的挣扎与选择。

Method: 通过历史案例研究，分析艺术风格的形成与人类创作挣扎的关系。

Result: 指出AI系统将人类创作选择简化为可复制模式，缺乏对创作过程的记录。

Conclusion: 建议HCI研究转向自动记录艺术风格的起源和演化，而非仅追求美学效果的复制。

Abstract: As AI art generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, HCI research has
focused primarily on questions of detection, authenticity, and automation. This
paper argues that such approaches fundamentally misunderstand how artistic
value emerges from the concerns that drive human image production. Through
examination of historical precedents, we demonstrate that artistic style is not
only visual appearance but the resolution of creative struggle, as artists
wrestle with influence and technical constraints to develop unique ways of
seeing. Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible
patterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies
not only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the
origins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual
traces. This reframing suggests new technical directions for HCI research in
generative AI, focused on automatic documentation of stylistic lineage and
creative choice rather than simple reproduction of aesthetic effects.

Motivation: AI系统虽然能增强认知能力，但也可能导致用户因过度依赖而停滞成长，即“舒适-成长悖论”。

Result: 研究表明，该框架能加速技能获取、提升自我调节能力和高阶思维。

Conclusion: 增强认知支架通过平衡便利性与认知发展，为人类与AI协作提供了更健康的路径。

Abstract: AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to
active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these
systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and
creativity - they present a fundamental "comfort-growth paradox": AI's
user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive
friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and
provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency
rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to
resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to
dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding
principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)
Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence
increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual
needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing
mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.
Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains
supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved
self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes
safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias
amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in
human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward
genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and
continuous learning.

Abstract: Scalable oversight protocols aim to empower evaluators to accurately verify
AI models more capable than themselves. However, human evaluators are subject
to biases that can lead to systematic errors. We conduct two studies examining
the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the
model is "correct most of the time, but not all of the time". We find no
overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing
arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model
is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in
the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers
are incorrect. We also reanalyze data from prior work that was more optimistic
about simple protocols, finding that human evaluators possessing knowledge
absent from models likely contributed to their positive results--an advantage
that diminishes as models continue to scale in capability. These findings
underscore the importance of testing the degree to which oversight protocols
are robust to evaluator biases, whether they outperform simple deference to the
model under evaluation, and whether their performance scales with increasing
problem difficulty and model capability.

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -

behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus
primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our
work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the
Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately
simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling
module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term,
medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple
Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the
Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions,
needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily
life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence,
one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological
experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates
more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully
replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more
accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and
offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for tailored healthcare
communication but face challenges in interpretability and multi-task
integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their
real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated.
Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text
and image-based inquiries related to myopia. To achieve this, ChatMyopia
integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge
base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic
maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations
validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to
myopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a
randomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly
improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing
patient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare
practitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as
a valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction
with medical services in primary eye care settings.

Conclusion: 结论认为，通过量化凝视压力并设计包容性AI，可以促进社会心理空间的多样性和真实性。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to
create psychological spaciousness in society. Spaciousness is defined as the
ability to hold diverse interpersonal interactions and forms the basis for
vulnerability that leads to authenticity that leads to prosocial behaviors and
thus to societal harmony. This paper demonstrates an attempt to quantify, the
human conditioning to subconsciously modify authentic self-expression to fit
the norms of the dominant culture. Gaze is explored across various marginalized
and intersectional groups, using concepts from postmodern philosophy and
psychology. The effects of gaze are studied through analyzing a few redacted
Reddit posts, only to be discussed in discourse and not endorsement. A
mathematical formulation for the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite
Metric is presented to model the analysis of two sets of conversational spaces
in relation to one another. The outcome includes an equation to train Large
Language Models (LLMs) - the working mechanism of AI products such as Chat-GPT;
and an argument for affirming and inclusive HCI, based on the equation, is
presented. The argument is supported by a few principles of Neuro-plasticity,
The brain's lifelong capacity to rewire.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit
algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active
learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a ``black
box'', hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual
analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision
mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It
comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors,
evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis,
and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at
fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex
binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring
interpretable decision-making.

Motivation: 现有张量分解方法不支持灵活的对比分析，限制了复杂数据的理解。

Result: TULCA方法有效支持张量比较分析，并通过计算评估和案例研究验证了其效果。

Conclusion: TULCA方法及其可视化工具为张量分析提供了灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Comparing tensors and identifying their (dis)similar structures is
fundamental in understanding the underlying phenomena for complex data. Tensor
decomposition methods help analysts extract tensors' essential characteristics
and aid in visual analytics for tensors. In contrast to dimensionality
reduction (DR) methods designed only for analyzing a matrix (i.e., second-order
tensor), existing tensor decomposition methods do not support flexible
comparative analysis. To address this analysis limitation, we introduce a new
tensor decomposition method, named tensor unified linear comparative analysis
(TULCA), by extending its DR counterpart, ULCA, for tensor analysis. TULCA
integrates discriminant analysis and contrastive learning schemes for tensor
decomposition, enabling flexible comparison of tensors. We also introduce an
effective method to visualize a core tensor extracted from TULCA into a set of
2D visualizations. We integrate TULCA's functionalities into a visual analytics
interface to support analysts in interpreting and refining the TULCA results.
We demonstrate the efficacy of TULCA and the visual analytics interface with
computational evaluations and two case studies, including an analysis of log
data collected from a supercomputer.

Motivation: 探讨实践者在选择降维技术时是否偏向视觉吸引力而非结构忠实性，并验证这种偏见的存在及其原因。

Method: 通过用户研究验证偏见存在并分析其原因，重点关注颜色标签和曝光时间的影响。

Result: 研究发现视觉趣味性偏见确实存在，且在颜色标签和短暂曝光时间下更为显著。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了减少降维投影感知和解释偏见的策略。

Abstract: Selecting the dimensionality reduction technique that faithfully represents
the structure is essential for reliable visual communication and analytics. In
reality, however, practitioners favor projections for other attractions, such
as aesthetics and visual saliency, over the projection's structural
faithfulness, a bias we define as visual interestingness. In this research, we
conduct a user study that (1) verifies the existence of such bias and (2)
explains why the bias exists. Our study suggests that visual interestingness
biases practitioners' preferences when selecting projections for analysis, and
this bias intensifies with color-encoded labels and shorter exposure time.
Based on our findings, we discuss strategies to mitigate bias in perceiving and
interpreting DR projections.

Motivation: 现有工作仅能预测低维统计量，而本文旨在为更广泛的算法类建立状态演化预测。

Method: 提出了状态演化方法，适用于包含一阶和鞍点更新的算法，并开发了技术工具包，包括希尔伯特空间提升技术和Bolthausen条件方法。

Result: 证明了状态演化的严格预测，即使更新不可分离，并提供了有限样本偏差的保证。

Conclusion: 开发的技术工具包可应用于相关问题，扩展了高维非凸优化问题的分析能力。

Abstract: We develop a toolbox for exact analysis of iterative algorithms on a class of
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems with random data. While prior
work has shown that low-dimensional statistics of (generalized) first-order
methods can be predicted by a deterministic recursion known as state evolution,
our focus is on developing such a prediction for a more general class of
algorithms. We provide a state evolution for any method whose iterations are
given by (possibly interleaved) first-order and saddle point updates, showing
two main results. First, we establish a rigorous state evolution prediction
that holds even when the updates are not coordinate-wise separable. Second, we
establish finite-sample guarantees bounding the deviation of the empirical
updates from the established state evolution. In the process, we develop a
technical toolkit that may prove useful in related problems. One component of
this toolkit is a general Hilbert space lifting technique to prove existence
and uniqueness of a convenient parameterization of the state evolution. Another
component of the toolkit combines a generic application of Bolthausen's
conditioning method with a sequential variant of Gordon's Gaussian comparison
inequality, and provides additional ingredients that enable a general
finite-sample analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究矩阵去噪问题中低秩信号结构的精确估计，特别是在噪声干扰下如何准确恢复奇异向量及其子空间。

Method: 结合矩阵扰动分析、极值理论、鞍点近似方法和随机矩阵理论，提出了一种基于两到无穷范数的假设检验方法。

Result: 证明了样本与总体奇异向量的对齐差异的最大欧几里德行范数趋近于Gumbel分布，并展示了该方法在检测结构化替代假设时的更高功效。

Conclusion: 该方法在矩阵去噪中表现出优越性，尤其适用于检测局部差异，且对非高斯噪声具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper studies fine-grained singular subspace estimation in the matrix
denoising model where a deterministic low-rank signal matrix is additively
perturbed by a stochastic matrix of Gaussian noise. We establish that the
maximum Euclidean row norm (i.e., the two-to-infinity norm) of the aligned
difference between the leading sample and population singular vectors
approaches the Gumbel distribution in the large-matrix limit, under suitable
signal-to-noise conditions and after appropriate centering and scaling. We
apply our novel asymptotic distributional theory to test hypotheses of low-rank
signal structure encoded in the leading singular vectors and their
corresponding principal subspace. We provide de-biased estimators for the
corresponding nuisance signal singular values and show that our proposed
plug-in test statistic has desirable properties. Notably, compared to using the
Frobenius norm subspace distance, our test statistic based on the
two-to-infinity norm has higher power to detect structured alternatives that
differ from the null in only a few matrix entries or rows. Our main results are
obtained by a novel synthesis of and technical analysis involving entrywise
matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation
methods, and random matrix theory. Our contributions complement the existing
literature for matrix denoising focused on minimaxity, mean squared error
analysis, unitarily invariant distances between subspaces, component-wise
asymptotic distributional theory, and row-wise uniform error bounds. Numerical
simulations illustrate our main results and demonstrate the robustness
properties of our testing procedure to non-Gaussian noise distributions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了金融领域大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识冲突问题，提出了一种实验框架来量化分析LLMs在投资分析中的确认偏误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在金融投资服务中因预训练知识与实时市场数据的不一致而产生知识冲突，可能导致不可靠的投资建议。目前缺乏对LLMs实际投资观点的研究。

Method: 通过假设性场景（平衡与非平衡论点）提取模型的潜在偏好，并测量其持续性，重点关注行业、规模和动量。

Result: 研究发现大多数模型对大盘股和逆向策略有持续偏好，且容易固化为确认偏误。

Conclusion: LLMs在投资分析中存在明显的确认偏误，需进一步研究以优化其金融应用。

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场的高波动性给投资者带来挑战，需要一种自适应的方法来管理动态投资组合。

Method: 使用多智能体系统实现两种投资策略（静态等权重和动态优化），基于现代投资组合理论（MPT）指标进行优化。

Result: 动态优化策略在样本内和样本外均表现出显著更好的风险调整后收益。

Conclusion: 自适应技术在加密货币市场等波动性高的环境中具有优势，多智能体系统为金融自动化提供了可扩展、可审计和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of crypto markets has opened new opportunities for
investors, but at the same time exposed them to high volatility. To address the
challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper
presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to
autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on
daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to
2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal
weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented
to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such
as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility.
Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a
collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic
optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of
risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the
benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in
volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology
proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable,
auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.

Conclusion: 随着深度学习的进一步发展，特别是大型语言模型和视觉变换器的应用，结构生物学将迎来更高效的自动化和更广泛的可访问性，从而彻底改变对生物大分子结构和功能的理解。

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

Conclusion: 自适应重置神经元有效解决了信息丢失和统一处理问题，性能优越且节能。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

Conclusion: MPaGE为多目标优化提供了一种高效、自动化的启发式生成方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Motivation: 探讨AI建议如何影响人们对自私行为的感知和惩罚，以及责任如何分配给决策者和建议者。

Method: 结合社会心理学理论和行为经济学方法，通过预注册的经济激励实验，评估者对接受不同建议（AI、人类或无）并表现出自私或亲社会行为的决策者进行惩罚和责任分配。

Result: 亲社会行为几乎不受惩罚，自私行为则受严厉惩罚；自私行为在亲社会建议后惩罚更严厉，在自私建议后更宽容；决策者遵循AI建议时被认为责任更大，但惩罚无差异。

Conclusion: 行为内容和建议类型是惩罚的主要决定因素，建议来源不影响惩罚程度。

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such
advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by
selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study
this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine
machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered,
financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real
decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii)
encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved
selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further
assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed
that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior
was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to
receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after
prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas
selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI
compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not
vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice
source does not.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem comprises both technical and normative dimensions.
While technical solutions focus on implementing normative constraints in AI
systems, the normative problem concerns determining what these constraints
should be. This paper examines justifications for democratic approaches to the
normative problem -- where affected stakeholders determine AI alignment -- as
opposed to epistocratic approaches that defer to normative experts. We analyze
both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better
outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent
illegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative
uncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill
through political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify
significant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the
prevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests
that neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be
sufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert
judgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI
monopolization.

### [416] [Rainbow Noise: Stress-Testing Multimodal Harmful-Meme Detectors on LGBTQ Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19551)
*Ran Tong,Songtao Wei,Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对LGBTQ+仇恨模因的鲁棒性基准，测试了两种先进检测器（MemeCLIP和MemeBLIP2）的性能，并引入轻量级文本去噪适配器（TDA）提升MemeBLIP2的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨模因通过修改文本或图像逃避检测，现有模型在此类攻击下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 构建了包含四种文本攻击和三种图像扰动的基准测试，测试了MemeCLIP和MemeBLIP2的性能，并引入TDA增强MemeBLIP2。

Result: MemeCLIP表现更稳定，MemeBLIP2对文本攻击敏感，但TDA显著提升了其鲁棒性，使其成为最优模型。

Conclusion: 当前多模态安全模型存在漏洞，轻量级模块（如TDA）是提升防御能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: PEMUTA是一个基于教育理论的框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）对本科生毕业论文（UGTE）进行多维度评估，填补了自动化评估中教育理论应用的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在评估UGTE时通常只提供一个单一分数，忽略了多维度标准和教育目标，而教育理论在自动化评估中未得到充分利用。

Method: PEMUTA结合Vygotsky理论和Bloom分类法，采用分层提示方案，从六个维度（SLOWPR）评估UGTE，并结合少量样本提示和角色扮演提示技术。

Result: 实验表明，PEMUTA与专家评估高度一致，展现了在多维度、教育理论指导的UGTE评估中的潜力。

Conclusion: PEMUTA为自动化UGTE评估提供了教育理论支持的多维度方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a
student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years.
Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence,
they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation
score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting
their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and
diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long
informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of
cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet
remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we
pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates
domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided
by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical
prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions:
Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR),
followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie,
few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further
enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a
dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to
support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong
potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将质量模型与绿色AI倡议结合的可持续质量模型，并设计了一种领域特定语言（DSL）来定义ML模型的可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ML模型和数据集的增长，能源成本急剧上升，绿色AI成为重要研究课题。当前缺乏将能源描述与质量模型结合的自动分析方法。

Method: 提出可持续质量模型，结合质量模型和绿色AI倡议，设计DSL定义ML模型的可持续性。

Result: DSL可精确描述ML模型的可持续性，并扩展Model Cards，支持自动处理。

Conclusion: 该研究为ML模型的可持续性评估和自动比较提供了初步框架。

Abstract: The growth of machine learning (ML) models and associated datasets triggers a
consequent dramatic increase in energy costs for the use and training of these
models. In the current context of environmental awareness and global
sustainability concerns involving ICT, Green AI is becoming an important
research topic. Initiatives like the AI Energy Score Ratings are a good
example. Nevertheless, these benchmarking attempts are still to be integrated
with existing work on Quality Models and Service-Level Agreements common in
other, more mature, ICT subfields. This limits the (automatic) analysis of this
model energy descriptions and their use in (semi)automatic model comparison,
selection, and certification processes. We aim to leverage the concept of
quality models and merge it with existing ML model reporting initiatives and
Green/Frugal AI proposals to formalize a Sustainable Quality Model for AI/ML
models. As a first step, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language to precisely
define the sustainability aspects of an ML model (including the energy costs
for its different tasks). This information can then be exported as an extended
version of the well-known Model Cards initiative while, at the same time, being
formal enough to be input of any other model description automatic process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI和LLMs在医疗领域的潜力与挑战，强调其可能带来的效率提升与信息泄露风险。

Method: 分析AI和LLMs在医疗培训、临床实践及研究中的应用及其局限性。

Result: AI和LLMs可提升医疗效率，但需注意其缺乏客观真实性和信息泄露风险。

Conclusion: 医疗领域应用AI和LLMs需深思熟虑，以确保安全性和有效性。

Abstract: The medical ecosystem consists of the training of new clinicians and
researchers, the practice of clinical medicine, and areas of adjacent research.
There are many aspects of these domains that could benefit from the application
of task automation and programmatic assistance. Machine learning and artificial
intelligence techniques, including large language models (LLMs), have been
promised to deliver on healthcare innovation, improving care speed and
accuracy, and reducing the burden on staff for manual interventions. However,
LLMs have no understanding of objective truth that is based in reality. They
also represent real risks to the disclosure of protected information when used
by clinicians and researchers. The use of AI in medicine in general, and the
deployment of LLMs in particular, therefore requires careful consideration and
thoughtful application to reap the benefits of these technologies while
avoiding the dangers in each context.

TL;DR: AI在药物发现中的潜力在于构建可编程虚拟人类，以模拟药物从分子到表型的作用，填补早期发现与后期开发之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法仅数字化现有高通量实验，未能解决预测药物在人体中效果的根本挑战，导致药物发现的高失败率。

Method: 利用AI、高通量扰动分析及单细胞和空间组学技术，构建动态多尺度模型（可编程虚拟人类），模拟药物作用。

Result: 可编程虚拟人类能够从分子到表型层面模拟药物作用，优化疗效和安全性。

Conclusion: 可编程虚拟人类为药物发现提供了新范式，但仍需解决关键挑战以实现其潜力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery,
but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments.
They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not
address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans.
Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and
mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the
resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences,
limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early
discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates
in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current
experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real
world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent
advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and
spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable
virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from
molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable
virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and
safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of
programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug
discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities,
challenges, and roadmaps for their realization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs（如GPT-4）的碳足迹、水资源消耗和电子垃圾问题，呼吁关注其生态影响。

Method: 通过案例研究（如GPT-4和Mistral 7B）量化环境成本，分析行业实践和政策缺失。

Result: 训练单个LLM的碳排放相当于数百辆汽车的年排放，数据中心加剧水资源短缺。

Conclusion: 提出技术、政策和文化变革以实现可持续NLP，强调全球合作和伦理责任的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural
language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously
overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying
their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case
studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral
7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of
cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in
vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model
development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening
marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for
sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum
computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and
cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry
leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the
urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate
action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article
concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary
boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems
that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

Motivation: 当前评估方法依赖明确披露内部状态的客户模拟器，无法测试LLM心理咨询师是否能挖掘未表达的观点。

Method: 引入MindVoyager框架，包含可控且动态适应的客户模拟器，以及评估LLM心理咨询师探索能力的指标。

Result: MindVoyager提供了一个更真实和具有挑战性的评估环境，能够衡量LLM心理咨询师对客户信念和思想的深入理解。

Conclusion: MindVoyager填补了现有评估方法的不足，为LLM心理咨询师的能力评估提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Understanding clients' thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet
current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability.
Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose
internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an
LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation,
we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable
and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the
ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging
evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the
exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding
of client's beliefs and thoughts.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨技术（如大型语言模型）对人类意义创造的影响，以及佛教哲学如何应对这种挑战。

Method: 方法是通过生成虚构佛经文本，并从哲学和文学角度进行详细分析。

Result: 生成的文本具有概念微妙性、丰富意象和密集引用，难以因其机械起源而被轻易否定。

Conclusion: 结论认为佛教哲学可能适应技术对人类意义创造的挑战，并引发社会对这一问题的思考。

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to
generate a fictional Buddhist "sutr"', and offers a detailed analysis of the
resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual
subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard
to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions
about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially
unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making.
We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to
adapt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中缺乏对BC和RL在训练G&CNETs中的直接比较，因此本文旨在系统评估这两种方法在连续推力航天器轨迹优化任务中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种针对G&CNETs的RL训练框架，结合了分离的动作与控制频率以及奖励重新分配策略，并与BC方法进行对比。

Result: BC训练的G&CNETs能精确模仿专家策略，但受限于训练数据质量；RL训练的G&CNETs在随机条件下表现更优，并能发现优于专家演示的全局最优策略。

Conclusion: BC适合确定性环境，而RL在适应性和发现全局最优策略方面更具优势。

Abstract: Guidance & control networks (G&CNETs) provide a promising alternative to
on-board guidance and control (G&C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a
differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control
architecture. When training G&CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge:
behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement
learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors.
Although both approaches have been adopted in G&CNET related literature, direct
comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&CNETs on continuous-thrust
spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training
framework tailored to G&CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control
frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training
and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&CNETs
excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal
control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively
constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast
RL-trained G&CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic
conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert
demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the
generation of training samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数网页不符合可访问性指南，导致部分用户无法访问内容，手动修正成本高，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出新分类法（句法、语义、布局），结合现有工具和LLM，通过提示策略修正违规。

Result: AccessGuru在真实基准测试中平均违规分数降低84%，远超之前方法的50%。

Conclusion: AccessGuru为网页可访问性提供了高效自动化解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web
accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities
from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users
requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page
providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to
automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.
While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of
accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting
accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We
introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three
key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a
structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and
redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which
combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to
correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a
benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies
syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through
comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our
benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score
decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，LLMs因其性能和灵活性在APR工具链中流行，但训练成本高。微调技术能以较低成本适配预训练模型，但其对APR任务的影响尚需实证研究。

Method: 实验评估了六种预训练LLMs（如CodeGen、CodeT5等）在三种APR基准（QuixBugs、Defects4J、HumanEval-Java）上的表现，比较了无微调、完全微调和PEFT（LoRA和IA3）三种训练方案。

Result: 完全微调因数据分布差异和过拟合导致性能下降，而PEFT通过限制可训练参数取得了更好效果。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调方法在APR任务中表现更优，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help
developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在代码补全中难以有效利用未显式导入的内部API信息，影响了准确性。

Method: 扩展API表示，构建使用示例和语义描述，形成知识库供LLMs生成补全。同时提出ProjBench基准。

Result: 在ProjBench和CrossCodeEval上，代码精确匹配提升22.72%，标识符匹配提升18.31%。与现有基线结合后，提升更显著。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了代码补全的准确性，尤其在处理内部API信息时表现优异。

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

Result: 确定了11个ES-CodeGen维度，包括新增的代码质量维度，并揭示了相关后果和阶段。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁关注ES-CodeGen中的伦理问题，并发现从业者常忽视社会相关维度。

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and
effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are
growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing,
privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching
goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing
attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we
introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to
refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development
from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices.
To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review
where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code
generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of
ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of
ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who
submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users
have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation
models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension
on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified
consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey
reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related
dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or
strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen.
Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

Conclusion: FreeLog解决了零标签条件下的跨系统日志异常检测问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large
amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world
applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified
as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve
promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However,
their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start
problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we
explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly
detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we
propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that
eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log
anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three
public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the
target system.

Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the
unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises
must adapt their organisational structures and operations. This organisational
shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key
innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This
paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in
designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in
Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of
steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The
construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge
artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations.
The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders

*Sourena Khanzadeh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AgentMesh是一个基于Python的框架，利用多个协作的LLM驱动代理自动化软件开发任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件开发需要多领域专家协作，复杂且耗时。

Method: 通过Planner、Coder、Debugger和Reviewer四个专业代理协同工作，将高级需求转化为完整代码。

Result: 案例研究表明，AgentMesh能处理非平凡开发任务，通过任务分解、代码生成、调试和审查实现自动化。

Conclusion: 多代理协作能发挥LLM优势并缓解单代理限制，未来需解决错误传播和上下文扩展等问题。

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally
requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose
AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered
agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents
- a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a
high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first
decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements
each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the
Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We
describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,
and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow
orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial
development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative
debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities
among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while
mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations -
such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward
more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering
automation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了CrossPL基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）生成跨编程语言（CPL）互操作代码的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在软件工程中的应用增加，生成跨语言互操作代码的能力尚未充分研究，这对构建复杂系统至关重要。

Method: 通过分析GitHub多语言仓库和开发LLM自动提取代码的流程，构建了包含1,982个任务的CrossPL基准，并评估了20种LLM。

Result: 结果显示，即使是表现最好的模型在CPL场景中也表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对CPL互操作代码生成进行更多针对性研究的必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software
engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating
correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability.
This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components
written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication
(IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code.
CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used
programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct
this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using
156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based
pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task
instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the
past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even
the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need
for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/crosspl-2814.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了SFT和DPO在不同代码偏好场景中的作用，提出了APO方法，动态整合策略以优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过SFT和DPO更好地对齐LLMs与不同代码偏好，以解决最优训练策略不明确的问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验观察，提出APO方法，动态整合SFT和DPO，适应不同场景。

Result: APO在六项代表性代码偏好任务中表现优于或匹配现有SFT和S&D策略。

Conclusion: APO为不同代码偏好对齐场景提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear
across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically
investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code
preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we
hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal
solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore
superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal
solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive
Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively
amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages
exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive
experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our
theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or
surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides
both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate
training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成任务中对模糊、不完整或矛盾的任务描述的鲁棒性，发现即使是微小的描述缺陷也会显著降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中任务描述常存在模糊性，而现有研究多在理想条件下评估LLMs，因此需探究模型在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 扩展HumanEval和MBPP基准，通过系统化引入任务描述缺陷，评估不同规模和架构的LLMs的功能正确性和失败模式。

Result: 任务描述的微小缺陷会导致性能显著下降，矛盾描述引发逻辑错误；大模型虽更稳健，但仍受描述不清晰影响。

Conclusion: 需开发对自然用户任务缺陷更具鲁棒性的LLMs，改进训练策略和评估基准，以提升实际部署的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code
generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear
and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit
ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we
present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art
code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We
extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing
realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing
a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We
evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their
functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories.
Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing
can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task
descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger
models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to
the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error
patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior,
and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs
that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in
natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model
training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and
ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

*Maria Camporese,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动漏洞修复（AVR）中的表现，探讨其成功是否源于训练数据泄漏或完美故障定位等隐藏因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs在AVR中的优势是否依赖于记忆人类修复方案，而非真正的修复能力。

Method: 通过故意在提示中引入错误位置偏移，测试LLMs生成修复补丁的能力，并使用双重LLM流程和手动审核验证结果。

Result: 通过实验分析LLMs在不同位置偏移下的修复表现，评估其是否仅依赖记忆。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在AVR中的潜在局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of
program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)
outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code
generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands"
such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM
reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by
deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the
prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large
localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because
any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans
benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.
A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the
result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually
audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the
Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.

Motivation: 传统方法仅最小化重建误差，忽略了降维模型在后续学习中的预测误差，可能导致嵌入不光滑或振荡。

Method: 采用贪婪训练方法，同时优化重建误差和预测误差，避免非光滑嵌入。

Result: 在传输和湍流问题中，新方法使降维模型精度提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: 贪婪训练方法显著提升了降维模型的准确性，优于仅优化重建误差的传统方法。

Abstract: Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained
to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the
error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is
ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into
account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction
error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns
quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it
avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning
accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow
problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy
approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher
accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction
error alone.

Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form
mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as
well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection
criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space.
Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an
alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information
theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach
establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit
approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic
approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to
consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.

Abstract: Solder joint reliability related to failures due to thermomechanical loading
is a critically important yet physically complex engineering problem. As a
result, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an
increasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design
schemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with
Gaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The
authors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting
thorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple
acquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational
cost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the
shortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel
heuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the
various optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to
regular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The
results show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing
regular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint
reliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep
strain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms
regular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold,
critically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical
result underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian
data-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related
expenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the
data-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Bag-of-Coins（BoC）的非参数统计测试方法，用于评估分类器内部预测一致性，发现ViTs的置信度校准效果显著优于CNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络的高精度往往伴随着置信度校准不佳的问题，限制了其在关键应用中的可靠性。现有方法通常仅对模型输出进行后处理，而忽略了预测的内部一致性。

Method: 引入BoC测试，将置信度估计重新定义为频率假设检验，检查模型的最高排名类别是否与其softmax概率一致。

Result: 在ViTs上，BoC实现了近乎完美的校准（ECE为0.0212），比基线方法提升了88%；而在CNNs（如ResNet）上，揭示了预测与内部logit结构的不一致性。

Conclusion: BoC不仅是一种校准方法，更是一种诊断工具，揭示了不同架构在不确定性表示上的差异。

Abstract: Modern neural networks, despite their high accuracy, often produce poorly
calibrated confidence scores, limiting their reliability in high-stakes
applications. Existing calibration methods typically post-process model outputs
without interrogating the internal consistency of the predictions themselves.
In this work, we introduce a novel, non-parametric statistical probe, the
Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, that examines the internal consistency of a
classifier's logits. The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a
frequentist hypothesis test: does the model's top-ranked class win 1-v-1
contests against random competitors at a rate consistent with its own stated
softmax probability? When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this
simple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy. On Vision Transformers (ViTs),
the BoC output serves as a state-of-the-art confidence score, achieving
near-perfect calibration with an ECE of 0.0212, an 88% improvement over a
temperature-scaled baseline. Conversely, on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) like ResNet, the probe reveals a deep inconsistency between the model's
predictions and its internal logit structure, a property missed by traditional
metrics. We posit that BoC is not merely a calibration method, but a new
diagnostic tool for understanding and exposing the differing ways that popular
architectures represent uncertainty.

Motivation: 传统DMD方法难以区分局部和全局模态，稀疏模式DMD旨在解决这一问题，并明确构建频谱的不同部分。

Result: 算法在合成和真实系统（如光波导、量子力学和海面温度数据）中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 稀疏模式DMD能够无监督地明确区分局部和全局模态，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven approach that extracts
the dominant features from spatiotemporal data. In this work, we introduce
sparse-mode DMD, a new variant of the optimized DMD framework that specifically
leverages sparsity-promoting regularization in order to approximate DMD modes
which have localized spatial structure. The algorithm maintains the
noise-robust properties of optimized DMD while disambiguating between modes
which are spatially local versus global in nature. In many applications, such
modes are associated with discrete and continuous spectra respectively, thus
allowing the algorithm to explicitly construct, in an unsupervised manner, the
distinct portions of the spectrum. We demonstrate this by analyzing synthetic
and real-world systems, including examples from optical waveguides, quantum
mechanics, and sea surface temperature data.

Abstract: Predicting Parkinson's Disease (PD) progression is crucial, and voice
biomarkers offer a non-invasive method for tracking symptom severity (UPDRS
scores) through telemonitoring. Analyzing this longitudinal data is challenging
due to within-subject correlations and complex, nonlinear patient-specific
progression patterns. This study benchmarks LMMs against two advanced hybrid
approaches: the Generalized Neural Network Mixed Model (GNMM) (Mandel 2021),
which embeds a neural network within a GLMM structure, and the Neural Mixed
Effects (NME) model (Wortwein 2023), allowing nonlinear subject-specific
parameters throughout the network. Using the Oxford Parkinson's telemonitoring
voice dataset, we evaluate these models' performance in predicting Total UPDRS

Conclusion: 本文为DP-SGD提供了统计推断的理论基础和方法支持，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in machine learning, particularly through Differentially
Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), is critical for sensitive data
analysis. However, existing statistical inference methods for SGD predominantly
focus on cyclic subsampling, while DP-SGD requires randomized subsampling. This
paper first bridges this gap by establishing the asymptotic properties of SGD
under the randomized rule and extending these results to DP-SGD. For the output
of DP-SGD, we show that the asymptotic variance decomposes into statistical,
sampling, and privacy-induced components. Two methods are proposed for
constructing valid confidence intervals: the plug-in method and the random
scaling method. We also perform extensive numerical analysis, which shows that
the proposed confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage rates while
maintaining privacy.

Abstract: While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is
unattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the
promise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional
guarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining
conditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing
heteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density
$\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this
vein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,
typically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,
we observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the
case of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly
conformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a
number of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how
to construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets
as partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal
sets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results
indicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely
approximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to
alternative methods.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms for functional data and have become
a key tool for emulating large-scale dynamical systems. Recent advances in deep
neural operators have dramatically improved the accuracy and scalability of
operator modeling, but lack an inherent notion of predictive uncertainty. We
introduce Local Spectral Conformal Inference (LSCI), a new framework for
locally adaptive, distribution-free uncertainty quantification for neural
operator models. LSCI uses projection-based depth scoring and localized
conformal inference to generate function-valued prediction sets with
statistical guarantees. We prove approximate finite-sample marginal coverage
under local exchangeability, and demonstrate significant gains in adaptivity
and coverage across synthetic and real-world operator learning tasks.

Motivation: 现有预训练策略在目标匹配和泛化能力上存在不足，IPIP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用迭代预训练框架和遗忘机制，避免陷入局部最优。

Result: 在Mo-S-O系统中，预测误差减少80%，速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: IPIP在轻量级架构下实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and have been applied across
various domains in physical science. However, their performance often relies on
large-scale labeled training data. While existing pretraining strategies can
improve model performance, they often suffer from a mismatch between the
objectives of pretraining and downstream tasks or rely on extensive labeled
datasets and increasingly complex architectures to achieve broad
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Pretraining
for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP), a framework designed to iteratively improve
the predictive performance of MLIP models. IPIP incorporates a forgetting
mechanism to prevent iterative training from converging to suboptimal local
minima. Unlike general-purpose foundation models, which frequently underperform
on specialized tasks due to a trade-off between generality and system-specific
accuracy, IPIP achieves higher accuracy and efficiency using lightweight
architectures. Compared to general-purpose force fields, this approach achieves
over 80% reduction in prediction error and up to 4x speedup in the challenging
Mo-S-O system, enabling fast and accurate simulations.
