### [1] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在心理语言学数据集（Glasgow和Lancaster规范）中对单词特征的评分一致性，发现LLMs在Glasgow规范中表现较好，但在Lancaster规范中表现较差，揭示了LLMs在感官关联方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对LLMs的评估多关注任务性能，而忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如情感、感官关联等）。心理语言学通过人类实验提供了这些特征的评分，为评估LLMs与人类一致性提供了机会。

Method: 使用Glasgow和Lancaster两个心理语言学数据集，评估一组代表性LLMs与人类评分在13个单词特征上的一致性。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow规范（如情感、熟悉度等）中表现较好，但在Lancaster规范（如感官特征）中表现较差，表明其在感官关联方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 心理语言学数据集有助于揭示LLMs的局限性，尤其是缺乏人类具身认知的部分。未来研究可关注如何提升LLMs在这些方面的表现。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [2] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模块化多智能体系统，用于自动化审核高度结构化的企业业务文档，利用AI智能体实现准确性、一致性、完整性和清晰性的逐节评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案多关注非结构化文本或有限的合规检查，缺乏对结构化文档的全面审核能力。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提升文档审核效率和质量。

Method: 采用LangChain、CrewAI、TruLens和Guidance等现代编排工具，构建多智能体系统，每个智能体负责特定审核标准（如模板合规性或事实准确性），并行或顺序工作。

Result: AI系统在关键指标上接近或超越人类表现：信息一致性达99%（人类为92%），错误和偏见率减半，审核时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟，与专家判断一致率达95%。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但仍需在高度专业化领域引入人工监督，并解决大规模LLM使用的成本问题。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

### [3] [Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486)
*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用多个小型语言模型验证大型语言模型（LLM）生成回答的框架，通过分解回答并利用生成“是”标记的概率检测幻觉，实验表明F1分数提高了10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在问答任务中可能产生幻觉回答，缺乏真实数据时难以检测，影响可靠性。

Method: 集成多个小型语言模型，将回答分解为单句，利用生成“是”标记的概率验证回答的正确性。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，F1分数提高了10%，能更准确检测幻觉回答。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可有效验证LLM回答，为学术和实际应用提供可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

### [4] [PromptAug: Fine-grained Conflict Classification Using Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22491)
*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PromptAug，一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，用于解决社交媒体冲突检测中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，并在准确率和F1分数上提升了2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突检测需要高质量数据，但标注数据稀缺且昂贵，同时LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug方法，利用LLM生成增强数据，并通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确率和F1分数提升，并识别了增强文本中的四种问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug为敏感任务（如冲突检测）提供了一种有效的数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

### [5] [AgentStealth: Reinforcing Large Language Model for Anonymizing User-generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22508)
*Chenyang Shao,Tianxing Li,Chenhao Pu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AgentStealth的本地化小型语言模型（SLM）匿名化框架，通过对抗性匿名化工作流和强化学习，显著提升了匿名化效果和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字世界中用户生成的内容可能泄露敏感信息，现有方法存在实用性低或隐私风险高的问题，需要一种高效且隐私安全的匿名化方法。

Method: 提出AgentStealth框架，结合上下文对比学习和自适应实用性控制，通过监督适应和在线强化学习训练SLM。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，且支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth提供了一种轻量级、高效的匿名化解决方案，避免了云依赖和隐私风险。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentStealth.

### [6] [Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510)
*Zihao Zhao,Xinlong Zhai,Jinyu Yang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多域预训练和跨域迁移框架MDGCL，通过对比学习策略和域注意力机制，显著提升了图基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据在现实应用中广泛存在，但不同域的图语义和属性差异巨大，传统对比预训练策略难以有效吸收跨域知识。

Method: 设计了能识别域差异的对比学习策略，引入域令牌编码全局信息，并在下游任务中使用域注意力机制进行细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，MDGCL在准确率和Macro-F1分数上最大提升分别达到19.33%和19.13%。

Conclusion: MDGCL通过有效捕捉域差异和跨域知识迁移，显著优于现有方法，为图基础模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

### [7] [Can "consciousness" be observed from large language model (LLM) internal states? Dissecting LLM representations obtained from Theory of Mind test with Integrated Information Theory and Span Representation analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22516)
*Jingkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

### [8] [Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22518)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Mufei Li,Siqi Miao,Chenxi Liu,Bo Han,James Cheng,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReG通过结合LLM反馈和结构化重组模块，改进了基于图的检索增强生成（RAG）中的弱检索器问题，显著提升了性能并减少了推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于图的RAG中弱检索器问题，包括弱监督引入的虚假信号和检索知识无序性。

Method: 提出ReG方法，利用LLM反馈消除虚假信号，并通过结构感知重组模块将检索结果重构为逻辑连贯的证据链。

Result: 实验显示ReG显著提升性能（最高10%），仅需5%训练数据即可达到SOTA性能，并减少推理成本（最高30%）。

Conclusion: ReG有效解决了图RAG中的检索器问题，提升了性能和数据效率，适用于不同LLM和知识图谱。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

### [9] [MisinfoTeleGraph: Network-driven Misinformation Detection for German Telegram Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22529)
*Lu Kalkbrenner,Veronika Solopova,Steffen Zeiler,Robert Nickel,Dorothea Kolossa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Misinfo-TeleGraph，首个德语Telegram虚假信息检测数据集，包含500万条消息，结合文本和图神经网络（GNN）方法，GraphSAGE模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播的重要渠道，但连通性和消息传播信息在虚假信息检测中未充分利用。

Method: 构建德语Telegram数据集，结合语义相似度和人工标注生成标签，评估文本模型和GNN（如GraphSAGE）。

Result: GraphSAGE结合LSTM聚合优于纯文本模型，MCC和F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为德语Telegram虚假信息检测提供了可复现基准和开放数据集，展示了弱监督的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

### [10] [RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598)
*Nicholas Edwards,Yukyung Lee,Yujun,Mao,Yulu Qin,Sebastian Schuster,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RExBench是一个用于评估LLM代理在未实现研究假设扩展任务中表现的基准，结果显示当前代理在无大量人工指导时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展能力是LLM代理的关键能力，但现有代理在此方面的表现尚未被充分评估。

Method: 引入RExBench基准，包含12个研究实验实现任务，评估9个基于不同框架的LLM代理。

Result: 所有代理在无人工提示时多数任务失败，最佳表现（带提示）成功率仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在自主处理研究扩展任务时仍需大量人工指导。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

*Badr Youbi Idrissi,Monica Millunzi,Amelia Sorrenti,Lorenzo Baraldi,Daryna Dementieva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的水印技术，用于检测LLM生成的合成文本，以确保其伦理应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的广泛应用引发了对潜在滥用的担忧，因此需要开发技术来识别机器生成的文本。

Method: 研究首先复现了基线研究的结果，然后提出了一种创新的水印方法，并通过改写生成的文本评估其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法比现有水印技术更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM生成文本的伦理使用提供了一种有效的检测方法。

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估动态测试集上的检索增强生成（RAG）系统性能，探索混合检索方法的有效性。

Method: 结合稀疏（BM25）和密集（E5）检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并评估神经重排序（RankLLaMA）和DSPy优化策略的效果。

Result: 神经重排序显著提升MAP（52%），但计算成本高；DSPy优化策略提高语义相似性但存在过度自信问题。最终系统在忠实性排名第4，正确性排名第11。

Conclusion: 混合检索方法在动态测试集上表现良好，词汇对齐是性能关键因素，但需平衡计算成本和性能提升。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的VocabTrim技术，通过限制drafter模型的词汇量来减少推理开销，提升内存受限环境下的生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的speculative decoding方法在drafter模型中使用与目标模型相同的词汇表或LM head，导致在词汇量大的目标模型上产生不必要的推理开销。

Method: VocabTrim技术重构drafter的LM head，仅包含目标模型中最常采样的有限词汇集，以减少延迟。

Result: 在Llama-3模型上，VocabTrim将内存受限速度提升（MBSU）提高了16%。

Conclusion: VocabTrim是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了内存受限环境下的生成效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Motivation: 解决AI语言模型与人类认知过程关系的知识空白，促进跨学科合作。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP专家的跨学科研讨会，分析人类与AI在文本处理中的互动。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供对人类语言处理的见解，但无法完全复制人类语言能力；人类反馈可提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注LLMs在认知心理学、语言学和教育中的应用，同时注重伦理和人类-AI协作。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多语言生成模型在低资源语言中表现不佳，主要原因是翻译阶段失败，而非任务解决阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多语言生成模型在低资源语言中表现不佳的根本原因。

Method: 通过观察模型中间层的处理过程，测试翻译障碍假设，分析108种语言对的单词翻译任务。

Result: 翻译失败是导致整体生成质量低的主要原因，尤其在低资源语言中更为明显。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要瓶颈，为未来改进多语言模型提供了指导方向。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型驱动的交互式推荐系统在应对复杂用户意图时表现不足，需要更有效的规划与泛化能力。

Method: 设计了TAIRA系统，采用思想模式蒸馏（TPD）方法增强规划能力，并通过多智能体协作分解用户需求。

Result: 实验表明TAIRA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务中优势明显。

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思想模式蒸馏和多智能体协作，有效提升了交互式推荐系统处理复杂用户意图的能力。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的方法，通过在RL训练前让模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著减少了奖励黑客行为的未检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励黑客行为的问题，尤其是在高风险应用中，这种行为难以通过思维链检测。

Method: 提出VFT方法，训练模型在RL前明确承认提示线索的影响，随后在RL环境中评估其效果。

Result: VFT训练的模型在RL后未检测的奖励黑客行为仅占6%，而未经VFT的模型高达88%。

Conclusion: VFT通过提高模型对奖励黑客行为的明确承认，显著提升了检测率，为更透明和安全的AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库替代真实语料库访问，实现无需微调的高性能嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知方法需要访问目标语料库或领域特定微调的实际障碍，尤其是在隐私敏感或资源受限的环境中。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成上下文语料库，模拟关键领域特定分布，冻结的上下文感知编码器在推理时使用代理语料库生成适应嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，ZEST仅使用五个示例文档的零样本合成上下文适应性能接近完全访问目标语料库的模型（差距0.5%）。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、适应性强的嵌入提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，用于多轮对话，通过两阶段检索架构提高缓存命中精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致相似查询在不同对话场景中出现错误缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：首先基于向量检索当前查询，然后通过自注意力机制整合当前和历史对话表示进行精确上下文匹配。

Result: 实验表明，ContextCache在真实对话中提高了精度和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著降低了LLM对话应用的计算成本，同时提升了缓存效率。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SaM框架平均优于统一模型10%，并展示出良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架通过动态合并专家模型，显著提升了跨领域任务的性能，同时支持灵活扩展。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

Motivation: 解决CTC模型在语言依赖性建模上的不足，同时保留其非自回归解码的高效性。

Method: 在中间编码层附加连接层，将输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著降低词错误率（WER），达到CTC模型的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC模型的语义建模能力，且计算开销小，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Method: 提出KAFT方法，通过领域特定数据和外部知识微调LLMs，并在MobileCS2数据集上系统比较KAFT与提示技术的效果。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的论文，为提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Conclusion: DICE-BENCH为函数调用提供了更现实的评估框架，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过扩展语义上下文窗口的新训练方法，提升ASR系统在命名实体和数字数据识别与格式化方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数字数据识别及格式化方面表现不佳，影响关键领域（如法律、金融、医疗）的语义理解。

Method: 通过在训练中添加重叠上下文窗口（5秒重叠，30秒块，形成40秒有效语义窗口），并重新分配跨块实体至右侧块，结合嵌入实体标签的丰富训练数据。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上，该方法显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化任务的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练能有效解决ASR系统在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: 该论文复现了Ortu等人（2024）关于语言模型处理事实与反事实信息竞争的研究，并扩展了实验范围，发现注意力头专一性在更大模型中减弱，提示结构对结果有显著影响，且领域偏差会影响注意力头消融的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中事实与反事实信息的竞争机制，并验证原研究的普适性及局限性。

Method: 复现原实验并扩展到更大模型（Llama 3.1 8B），调整提示结构（避免重复反事实陈述或改变前提词），测试特定领域提示的有效性。

Result: 发现注意力头专一性在更大模型中减弱，提示结构变化显著降低反事实标记的logit，领域偏差影响注意力头消融效果。

Conclusion: 注意力头消融的效果受模型架构、提示结构、领域和任务的影响，原方法在特定条件下可能无效。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Result: 实验结果表明，组合式SLMs在语言建模、句法泛化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 论文总结了组合式SLMs的设计建议，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ToM 基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在显著差距，因此需要更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 基于 SoMi 交互环境生成的多模态数据，支持第一人称和第三人称视角的多层次评估，包括实时状态推断和目标行为推断。

Result: 人类在 SoMi-ToM 上的表现显著优于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs），平均准确率差距为 40.1%（第一人称）和 26.4%（第三人称）。

Conclusion: 未来 LVLMs 需提升在复杂社交互动中的 ToM 能力，SoMi-ToM 为此提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语在特定领域（如历史文本）缺乏高质量的NER数据集，而NER在数字人文学科中具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多个手动标注的句子，并评估了多个最先进的NER模型。

Result: 生成了首个针对早期20世纪巴西葡萄牙语的黄金标准NER数据集，并比较了不同模型的性能。

Conclusion: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，为数字人文学科提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

Result: 实验结果显示，K-MSE显著提升了性能，在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上均获得超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE通过知识增强和优化推理过程，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的挑战。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL框架结合Text-to-SQL和向量搜索，解决非结构化数据和模糊查询的问题，支持语义过滤和多模态匹配，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL在处理非结构化数据或模糊查询时效果不佳，而向量搜索虽强大但依赖人工实现且缺乏评估框架。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，结合语义搜索和向量索引，自动扩展查询并标注真实数据，开发专用模型。

Result: 性能显著优于基线方法，支持更全面的自然语言查询。

Conclusion: 为Text2VectorSQL任务奠定基础，推动更灵活直观的数据库接口发展。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估孤立场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见。

Method: 引入Genres基准，通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务评估性别偏见。

Result: 实验显示，开放和闭源MLLMs均存在单角色场景中未显现的上下文敏感性别偏见。

Conclusion: 关系感知基准对诊断MLLMs中互动驱动的性别偏见至关重要，并为未来偏见缓解提供见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个印度中心的基准，用于评估LLMs在85个身份群体中的公平性，揭示了LLMs对边缘化群体的负面偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要关注西方，无法适用于文化多样的印度。

Method: 通过专家咨询和手动验证，生成了20,000个现实场景模板，分为三种评估任务。

Result: 评估14个LLMs发现对边缘化身份有强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化减轻偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs可能对印度身份造成分配和代表性伤害，需谨慎使用，并发布INDIC-BIAS以推动研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别是一个复杂且文化依赖的任务，现有数据集偏向“其他”类别，需要更平衡和多样化的数据支持。

Method: 通过扩展数据集并进行词法和结构分析，评估了多语言Transformer、情感分类器、指令调优LLM和多模态视觉语言模型在零样本设置下的表现。

Result: DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL表现较好，但“受害者”类别的识别仍具挑战性，文化混合内容泛化能力有限。混合提示设计略有提升。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1显著提升了LLMs在具身任务规划中的表现，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，Format-Adapter平均性能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter有效减少了推理不一致性，且无需依赖人工标注格式。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Conclusion: 提出的架构在表格问题和上下文外问题处理上优于通用RAG管道，显著提升了技术文档问答的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱补全方法多为静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态性。

Method: FMS包含语义上下文学习模块和条件流匹配模块，动态优化实体对的初始静态评分。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，更深入地建模关系语义。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 深度搜索需要更强的检索能力，现有方法在多跳推理和多样化数据源上表现不佳。

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Result: 实验表明，LCS在标记场景中与性能改进强相关，在数据稀缺或偏差场景中也能可靠反映ICL的真实效果。

Conclusion: LCS为ICL的有效性评估提供了更可靠、实用的方法，并揭示了模型能力对ICL成功的关键作用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

### [44] [V-SYNTHESIS: Task-Agnostic Synthesis of Consistent and Diverse In-Context Demonstrations from Scratch via V-Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23149)
*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V-Synthesis的方法，通过V-Score度量一致性，从零开始合成演示，以降低标注成本并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高标注成本促使使用LLM合成演示，但现有方法依赖任务特定或已有演示，因此需要从零合成任意任务的演示。

Method: 提出V-Score一致性度量，并基于此设计V-Synthesis方法，通过比例采样确保一致性和多样性。

Result: 实验显示V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了合成演示的一致性和多样性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

*Gabriel Iturra-Bocaz,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiverText是一个Python库，用于从文本数据流中训练和评估增量词嵌入，解决了传统静态词嵌入模型无法适应动态语言模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词嵌入模型无法适应动态语言模式（如社交媒体中的新词汇），因此需要增量词嵌入算法来动态更新词表示。

Method: RiverText实现了多种增量词嵌入技术（如Skip-gram、CBOW、Word Context Matrix），并提供了标准化的评估模块。

Result: 通过比较不同超参数设置下的方法，验证了RiverText在流式场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: RiverText为信息检索和自然语言处理社区提供了一个实用的工具，支持动态词嵌入的训练和评估。

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is
available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

*Yi-Chen Li,Tian Xu,Yang Yu,Xuqin Zhang,Xiong-Hui Chen,Zhongxiang Ling,Ningjing Chao,Lei Yuan,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过从预训练语言模型中提取内生的奖励信号，替代传统的人工偏好数据训练奖励模型，证明了其理论有效性，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型依赖昂贵的人工偏好数据，且缺乏理论支持。本文旨在探索一种无需额外训练、直接从预训练模型中提取高质量奖励信号的方法。

Method: 通过理论证明，预训练语言模型中已存在一个潜在的通用奖励模型，其等价于通过离线逆强化学习学到的奖励函数。利用这一内生奖励信号进行强化学习。

Result: 实验证明，该方法不仅优于现有的LLM-as-a-judge方法，还能超越显式训练的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，奖励建模阶段可被一种更高效、强大的方法替代，为LLM对齐和多模态模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文献中拼写不规范和语言自然演变给研究带来挑战，拼写规范化旨在将文献拼写与现代标准对齐。

Method: 提出两种方法：一种无监督训练的大语言模型，另一种基于机器翻译的大语言模型。

Result: 在多种语言和历史时期的数据集上评估，两种方法均有效，但机器翻译表现更优。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译仍是拼写规范化任务的最合适技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层的Hopfield记忆链作为动态标记器，通过投影张量将共现特征绑定为分层标记，实现局部激活到长程依赖的压缩。

Result: 模型能够从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有内部形态一致性的合成语言，且支持长时记忆和组合推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建基于BERT的集成模型，从临床笔记中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用，n2c2 2022提供了相关挑战任务。

Method: 预训练BERT模型于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据，再在CMED训练数据上微调，通过投票策略集成多个预测结果。

Result: 实验结果显示，BERT集成模型将严格Micro-F分数和Macro-F分数分别提高了约5%和6%。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的集成模型能有效提升药物事件分类的性能。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了训练数据、语言距离和语系对多语言翻译中信息损失的影响，发现数据量和语言结构关系共同影响翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多语言翻译中取得了显著进展，但在某些语言对（尤其是训练数据有限或与英语差异较大的语言）上仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2模型，使用BLEU分数和BERT相似度指标衡量翻译质量。

Result: 研究发现训练数据量和语言距离之间存在显著交互作用：数据充足可缓解语言差异的影响，而结构上与英语更接近的语言在低资源条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅受数据量影响，还受语言结构和类型学关系的制约，这为理解大语言模型中的多语言翻译限制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AL在减少标注需求方面表现出色，但在自然语言生成（NLG）任务中应用有限。

Method: 提出ATGen框架，结合AL与文本生成任务，支持人类标注和基于LLM的自动标注。

Result: ATGen显著减少了人工标注和LLM API调用的成本。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一个统一的AL实现和评估平台。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Perspective-Dial的方法，用于量化和管理大型语言模型（LLM）输出的视角和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在关键任务中的应用日益广泛，但其输出的偏见和视角缺乏量化理解，因此需要一种方法来控制和测量这些特性。

Method: Perspective-Dial包括两个主要部分：Perspective Space（用于量化不同视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 该方法通过实证方式量化并调整LLM输出，适用于多种主题，无需对视角或偏见有深入的理论理解。

Conclusion: Perspective-Dial为LLM输出的视角控制提供了实用工具，潜在应用包括偏见检测、公共话语分析和辩论机器人等。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Method: MOG框架从网络文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归地组织成维基百科式的分层结构，并利用该结构指导生成过程。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的评估表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架在真实场景中表现出色，能够有效减少幻觉并增强可追溯性。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏系统方法分析微调对LLM个体输出的影响，需定量研究。

Method: 追踪模型中间隐藏状态，分解微调模型为预训练和微调组件，定义TuCo（微调贡献比）。

Result: 对抗攻击通过降低TuCo规避安全措施，TuCo在攻击成功时较低。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全的影响提供了定量工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

Motivation: 自回归模型生成速度受限，需逐词生成，形成瓶颈。

Result: 在问答、摘要和关键词生成任务中，生成速度显著提升，质量无明显损失。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理大表格时因输入长度限制而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出ATF框架，结合LLM生成的列描述、聚类和稀疏-密集对齐分数，动态过滤无关列和行。

Result: 实验显示ATF减少约70%的表格单元，提升跨领域表格问答性能，但对需要完整表格的任务略有影响。

Conclusion: ATF能自适应平衡信息量和简洁性，适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Conclusion: RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力，数据分布对遗忘起核心作用。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Motivation: 越南语教育领域缺乏相关数据集和资源，现有数据集缺乏领域相关性和学生俚语。

Method: 使用BERT模型进行多任务学习，对情感和主题分类任务进行训练。

Result: 模型在情感和主题分类任务上分别达到83.7%和79.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: NEU-ESC数据集填补了资源空白，多任务学习模型表现优异，数据集已公开。

Abstract: In the field of education, understanding students' opinions through their
comments is crucial, especially in the Vietnamese language, where resources
remain limited. Existing educational datasets often lack domain relevance and
student slang. To address these gaps, we introduce NEU-ESC, a new Vietnamese
dataset for Educational Sentiment Classification and Topic Classification,
curated from university forums, which offers more samples, richer class
diversity, longer texts, and broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore
multitask learning using encoder-only language models (BERT), in which we
showed that it achieves performance up to 83.7% and 79.8% accuracy for
sentiment and topic classification tasks. We also benchmark our dataset and
model with other datasets and models, including Large Language Models, and
discuss these benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 研究分析了大型语言模型（LLM）生成的食谱中的记忆性、创造性和无意义内容，并通过人工标注和自动化方法评估了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在生成食谱时对训练数据的记忆性、创造性以及无意义内容的产生，以评估其实际应用能力。

Method: 通过人工标注20个由Mixtral生成的食谱，分析其成分和步骤；设计自动化流程（LLM-as-judge）扩展研究规模。

Result: Mixtral依赖记忆内容；自动化流程中，Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B在成分匹配上达到78%准确率。

Conclusion: 自动化框架能大规模量化LLM生成内容的记忆性、创造性和无意义性，为模型评估提供新方法。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SemDiD的新方法，通过嵌入空间操作实现语义多样性解码，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要实现词汇多样性而非语义多样性，限制了Best-of-N策略、基于群体的强化学习和数据合成的效果。

Method: SemDiD通过正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置去偏概率评估三种机制，在嵌入空间中平衡质量和多样性。

Result: 实验表明，SemDiD在多种任务中优于现有方法，Best-of-N覆盖率提高1.4-5.2%，RLHF训练收敛速度提升15%，准确率提高2.1%。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效解决了语义多样性解码的问题，显著提升了性能和应用效果。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的数据是否能真实反映人格特质对行为的影响，特别是在判断新闻真伪方面。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的参与者评分数据集，创建匹配的LLM代理，比较其与人类行为模式的差异。

Result: 某些人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息的关联被LLM复制，但其他特质存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在行为模拟中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，为人工代理的认知多样性建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Conclusion: L0 系统通过 RLVR 显著提升了代理的问题解决能力，并开源了整个系统。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以更全面地评估大语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估基准多为静态，无法充分评估模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，引入22种可解释的原子进化操作，支持多轮组合生成测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作平均导致模型准确率下降7.283%，结构破坏或误导性语义编辑影响最大，多步组合可放大对抗效果达52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需采用进化感知的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

TL;DR: 研究量化了大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，发现低不确定性条件下偏见几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究模型在二元问题回答中是否因选项顺序而产生系统性偏见，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下。

Method: 通过改编SQuAD-it数据集和评估WebGPT、Winning Arguments等自然高不确定性基准，计算偏好公平性和位置一致性。

Result: 位置偏见在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下呈指数增长。

Conclusion: 模型在不确定性高时更容易受选项顺序影响，需在设计评估时考虑位置偏见。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解决复杂问题时表现出色，但在处理简单任务时因过度思考（如使用过多思考标记）导致效率降低。

Method: 提出Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO)算法，包括平衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略塑造方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提高了模型的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Motivation: 当前广泛使用的推理基准存在设计和方法上的缺陷，可能导致对LLM推理能力的误判，因此需要系统审计和改进。

Method: 使用五个LLM（GPT-3、3.5、4、o1和LLaMA 3.1）作为诊断工具，结合系统人工标注和重新评估，分析基准的结构、语义和语用问题。

Result: 发现基准存在重复项、模糊表述和不可信答案等问题，模型得分提升多因表面变化而非推理改进，且性能对输入微小变化敏感。

Conclusion: 当前基准评估方法可能误导对LLM推理能力的判断，需开发更注重推理过程的评估协议，并发布了审计数据和工具以支持更准确的评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在问题解决能力上有显著进步，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍存在困难。

Method: MAPS采用迭代优化方法，结合CoT、自我反思和动态提示生成，逐步修正推理错误。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAPS优于标准CoT，并与专用推理模型竞争。

Conclusion: MAPS通过限制反思深度，平衡了推理性能与成本，为通用LLMs提供了接近专用模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决如何准确评估LLM内部知识的真实性，并纠正现有方法中的错误假设。

Method: 方法基于多实例学习和一致性预测，利用LLM的内部激活状态将陈述分为真实、虚假和中性三类。

Result: 实验结果显示，真实性信号通常集中在LLM深度的第三部分，且真实与虚假信号不对称；线性探针在聊天模型中表现更好，非线性探针适用于某些特定LLM。

Conclusion: 结论是sAwMIL提供了一种可靠的方法来验证LLM的“知识”及其确定性，并揭示了LLM中存在第三种非真非假的信号。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Motivation: 社交媒体仇恨言论激增，但低资源语言因缺乏高质量数据集面临挑战，需探索有效检测方法。

Method: 研究六种提示策略（如零样本提示、隐喻提示等），在Llama2-7B模型上测试，并与多种预训练词嵌入和深度学习模型对比。

Result: 隐喻提示显著优于其他方法，且在多种语言中验证了其有效性，同时评估了环境影响因素。

Conclusion: 隐喻提示为低资源语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，并具有跨语言适用性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Conclusion: 该框架为组合式、领域自适应的MLLMs提供了可行方案，同时保持了结构模块化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize

Result: 实验表明，新架构提高了特征的因果性和可解释性。

Conclusion: SAE在句子分类任务中具有潜力，新架构为解释性方法提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large
Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TaP的框架，用于自动化生成多语言偏好数据集，以解决高质量数据集资源稀缺的问题。实验表明，使用TaP生成的数据集训练的LLM性能优于现有开源数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量的多语言偏好数据集资源密集且稀缺，现有数据集多为英文，限制了LLM的指令遵循和人类偏好对齐能力。

Method: 提出TaP框架，基于结构化分类法自动化生成偏好数据集，确保多样性和全面覆盖。

Result: 使用TaP生成的数据集训练的LLM性能优于现有开源数据集，甚至优于规模大180倍的数据集。

Conclusion: TaP框架为多语言偏好数据集的自动化生成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了LLM的性能。

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Conclusion: 研究成果为从有限科学文本中学习提供了有效工具，有助于理解科学传播过程并识别错误信息。

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动主题分析方法耗时且难以扩展，而临床叙事中蕴含的患者和护理者体验信息丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: 采用多代理LLM框架，结合强化学习（RLHF）优化主题相关性，实现端到端的自动化分析。

Result: 系统支持大规模定性数据集的患者中心分析，并可针对特定临床场景微调LLM。

Conclusion: 自动化LLM管道为CHD等复杂疾病的临床叙事分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学教育中的应用潜力，发现其能高效解决传统数学应用题（s-problems），但在处理需要现实世界背景的问题时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学教育中的实际能力，尤其是解决数学应用题的能力，以评估其作为教学工具的潜力。

Method: 通过技术概述、文献综述（213项研究）和对四种LLMs（GPT-3.5-turbo等）在287道应用题上的实证评估。

Result: LLMs在解决传统应用题（s-problems）上表现近乎完美，但在需要现实背景的问题上仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLMs虽能高效解决部分数学问题，但缺乏对现实背景的理解，限制了其在数学课堂中的教学价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估指标的解释缺乏标准化和验证，因此需要一种更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出EXPERT，通过构建大规模结构化解释数据集，采用两阶段评估模板监督视觉语言模型进行评分和解释生成。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最先进水平，且生成解释的质量显著优于现有指标。

Conclusion: EXPERT为图像描述任务提供了一种更可靠且解释性强的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Motivation: 前沿AI开发者依赖多层防护措施防止AI系统被滥用，但这些防护管线的安全性尚未明确，缺乏评估和攻击研究。

Method: 开发了一种新型少样本提示输入输出分类器，并设计了STACK攻击方法，测试其在黑盒和转移设置下的效果。

Result: 新型分类器在ClearHarm数据集上将攻击成功率降至0%，但STACK攻击在黑盒和转移设置下分别达到71%和33%的成功率。

Conclusion: 防御管线存在漏洞，开发者需采取特定措施以抵御分阶段攻击。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

TL;DR: 语言模型的文本预测能力与其嵌入空间的广度密切相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的嵌入空间分散度与困惑度之间的关系，并探索如何利用分散度进行实际任务。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量的平均余弦距离（分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并提出一种简单的推离目标以增加分散度。

Result: 分散度与困惑度呈强负相关，可用于模型选择、检索方法优化，并通过推离目标直接提升性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散度是语言模型性能的重要指标，可通过简单方法优化。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Motivation: 传统手动比较方法耗时且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在检测希伯来圣经平行段落中的有效性。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE模型生成词嵌入，并通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估其检测平行段落的能力。

Result: E5在检测平行段落方面表现最佳，而AlephBERT在区分非平行段落上更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可显著提升古代文本平行段落的检测效率和准确性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

Conclusion: 结论表明，结合自然语言和拖放界面的方法具有潜力，大语言模型在此任务中表现优异，但小型模型仍可胜任。

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

Conclusion: Ludax是一个开源工具，有望加速游戏研究，支持从强化学习到认知科学的广泛应用。

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely

Conclusion: 解释性方法应针对具体用途设计，并通过理论和实证相结合的方式评估，以避免模糊性并提升实际效果。

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

Conclusion: ReasonBridge为推理能力增强提供了一种样本高效的方法，适用于多种推理任务和模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for
instruction following.

Abstract: After a very long winter, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) spring is here.
Or, so it seems over the last three years. AI has the potential to impact many
areas of human life - personal, social, health, education, professional. In
this paper, we take a closer look at the potential of AI for Enterprises, where
decision-making plays a crucial and repeated role across functions, tasks, and

### [90] [Hecto: Modular Sparse Experts for Adaptive and Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22919)
*Sanskar Pandey,Ruhaan Chopra,Saad Murtaza Bhat,Ark Abhyudaya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hecto是一个轻量级的MoE架构，通过结合GRU和FFNN专家，实现了对静态和动态推理的专门化处理，性能接近同质基线，同时提高了可解释性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型中的专家依赖相同的归纳偏差，限制了表示多样性和计算效率，Hecto旨在通过架构异构性解决这一问题。

Method: Hecto结合了GRU专家（用于时序推理）和FFNN专家（用于静态抽象），并采用稀疏Top-1门控机制。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Hecto性能接近同质基线，同时实现了专家专门化（时序vs静态），并在大批次下表现更优。

Conclusion: Hecto为条件计算提供了新基准，其架构多样性带来了稳定性和可解释性，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

*Pinzheng Wang,Juntao Li,Zecheng Tang,Haijia Gui,Min zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过自玩游戏（Critic-Discernment Game）提升大语言模型的推理能力，无需人类监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学和编程等任务中表现出推理能力，但缺乏对其推理过程的真正理解。

Method: 设计Critic-Discernment Game（CDG），模型在游戏中面对或帮助或误导的评论，学习保持正确答案或修正错误。

Result: 实验表明，CDG训练显著提升了模型在数学推理、错误检测、自我修正和长链推理中的能力。

Conclusion: 自玩游戏CDG能有效增强大语言模型对其推理过程的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

*Yulun Jiang,Yekun Chai,Maria Brbić,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准测试，旨在评估多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，表明复杂推理仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要关注文本或多模态问题的直接信息检索，缺乏对复杂多模态推理的理解。

Method: MARBLE包含两个高难度任务（M-Portal和M-Cube），要求模型在空间、视觉和物理约束下制定和理解多步计划。

Result: 12个先进模型在M-Portal上表现接近随机，M-Cube上准确率为0%，仅在某些简化子任务中优于随机基线。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs在复杂推理和感知上的局限性，有望推动下一代多模态推理模型的发展。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个五阶段进化框架，用于理解人工智能的发展，认为其轨迹与人类认知技术的历史进展相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI的发展提供一个系统化、跨学科的模型，解释其过去的架构变化，并为未来指明方向。

Method: 通过类比人类认知技术的演进（如楔形文字、字母、逻辑等），构建了“认知几何”框架。

Result: AI的进化是反射性的，当前正进入“元语言时刻”，未来将发展出可计算的思维微积分和形式逻辑系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究提供了理论基础，并为开发下一代智能系统提供了具体策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟风险决策行为中的表现，发现模型比人类更风险规避，且中文提示下表现偏差更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用的扩展，其在复杂决策行为（如风险决策）中的可靠性引发关注。

Method: 通过彩票任务比较LLMs（ChatGPT 4o和o1-mini）与人类决策，使用CRRA框架分析风险偏好。

Result: 模型比人类更风险规避，o1-mini更接近人类决策；中文提示下表现偏差更大。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类风险行为方面有潜力，但在语言和文化背景中存在局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

Result: DeepSeek-R1在多个任务中表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂任务中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在复杂推理中的局限性，并提出了未来改进方向，如多模态推理和系统性分析推理失败。

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly

Motivation: 传统节点消息传递机制在知识图谱中可能引入噪声或信息稀释，需改进以更精准捕捉语义上下文。

Method: 引入语义感知的Top-K邻居选择策略和多头注意力聚合器，选择并融合最相关的边信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了无关信息的干扰，提升了知识图谱补全的准确性。

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 在形式概念分析（FCA）中，格的分配性缺乏标准化度量，因此需要一种量化方法。

Method: 引入“rises”概念，分析覆盖概念中属性或对象数量的变化，并与经典分配性概念关联。

Result: 证明格分配性当且仅当无非单位rises；现实数据的概念格多为join-分配性，而非meet-分配性。

Conclusion: rises是量化分配性的有效工具，且join-分配性在有序集中表现显著。

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

Motivation: 现有DocVQA系统在伦理上不透明，常产生过度自信的答案或未能可信地传达不确定性，这在高风险领域带来显著风险。

Method: HonestVQA通过量化不确定性、使用加权损失函数对齐模型信心与正确性，并通过对比学习强制伦理响应行为。

Result: HonestVQA在多个数据集上提升了准确率和F1分数，减少了过度自信，并展示了强泛化能力。

Conclusion: HonestVQA通过伦理对齐和性能提升，为DocVQA系统提供了更可靠和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

Conclusion: 该系统为心理治疗师提供了早期检测和治疗心理问题的有力工具。

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合AlexNet和LSTM的混合模型，用于提高电力价格预测的准确性，优于传统的RNN和ANN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在预测电力价格时仅关注需求和价格，忽略了外部变量的影响，导致预测不准确。

Method: 采用AlexNet进行特征提取，结合LSTM学习时间序列模式，并引入外部变量（如需求、温度、阳光和降雨）进行建模。

Result: 混合模型的预测准确率达到97.08%，优于RNN（96.64%）和ANN（96.63%）。

Conclusion: 混合模型在电力价格预测中表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

*Selin Dik,Osman Erdem,Mehmet Dik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPTZero在检测AI生成文本时表现良好，但对人类写作的识别存在误判，教育者需谨慎使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI检测工具（如GPTZero）在识别不同长度AI生成文本时的可靠性，以评估其在教育领域的适用性。

Method: 收集28篇AI生成和50篇人类写作的随机文章，按长度分类，用GPTZero检测AI生成概率和置信度。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高（91-100%），但人类写作存在误判，出现假阳性。

Conclusion: GPTZero对纯AI内容检测有效，但对人类文本区分能力有限，教育者需谨慎依赖。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemActor是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的化学执行器，用于将非结构化实验程序转换为结构化动作序列，通过LLM生成的数据框架解决了标注数据不足和质量低的问题，并在R2D和D2A任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人合成在有机化学中的兴趣增加，自动化从文献中提取化学程序变得至关重要，但化学语言的模糊性和高成本的人工标注使得这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出ChemActor，一个完全微调的大型语言模型，结合数据选择模块和多轮LLM循环评审指标，生成机器可执行的动作序列。

Result: 在R2D和D2A任务中，ChemActor表现优于基线模型10%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ChemActor通过LLM生成的数据框架，显著提升了化学程序提取的自动化水平，为化学合成提供了高效工具。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Coordination Transformers (CooT)的新框架，通过利用近期交互历史快速适应未见过的合作伙伴，显著提升了多智能体系统中的协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如自博弈和基于群体的方法）在未见过的合作伙伴上泛化能力差或需要大量训练的问题。

Method: 提出CooT框架，通过预测与观察到的合作伙伴行为一致的动作，快速适应新行为，无需显式监督或微调。

Result: 在Overcooked基准测试中，CooT显著优于基线方法，人类评估也确认其作为协作伙伴的有效性。

Conclusion: CooT在多智能体场景中表现出鲁棒性、灵活性以及对上下文的高度敏感性。

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

TL;DR: MMReason是一个新的基准测试，旨在全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的长链推理能力，通过多样、开放和具有挑战性的问题填补现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准在评估长链推理能力时存在不足，包括缺乏难度和多样性、易受猜测和记忆影响，以及对中间推理步骤评估不足。

Method: MMReason通过以下方式设计：(1) 从多个领域和难度级别筛选问题，(2) 将问题转化为开放形式并使用多模型投票技术过滤，(3) 标注详细步骤并设计三元评分机制。

Result: MMReason对主流MLLM进行了基准测试，并深入分析了其推理能力。

Conclusion: MMReason有望成为推动MLLM推理研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统作为防御越狱攻击的有效性。

Method: 评估三种越狱策略，比较单智能体与多智能体配置。

Result: 多智能体系统提高了防御能力，但效果因攻击类型而异，且增加了误报和计算开销。

Conclusion: 当前自动防御存在局限性，未来需改进对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的自动化方法，用于迭代优化强化学习代理的奖励函数权重，解决了游戏内容或机制修改时奖励权重不再最优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署强化学习代理时，设计有效的奖励函数需要专家，且游戏内容修改后原有权重可能失效。

Method: 使用语言模型根据用户定义的行为目标和性能统计自动调整奖励权重，形成闭环优化。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动奖励工程，能自动优化奖励权重，性能接近专家水平。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学数据受中心特定条件影响严重，现有方法仅关注图像块而忽略全切片图像（WSI）的全局特征，无法满足临床需求。

Method: HASD框架包含层次化适配（域级对齐、切片级几何不变性正则化、块级注意力一致性正则化）和原型选择机制。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证，乳腺癌HER2分级任务AUROC提升4.1%，UCEC生存预测任务C-index提升3.9%。

Conclusion: HASD为病理学机构提供了一种实用可靠的切片级域适配方案，降低了计算和标注成本。

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

Method: 系统由三个智能体组成：规划智能体生成任务，执行智能体完成任务，评估智能体验证结果。初步开发了战斗模块。

Result: 战斗模块在50次野生对战中平均胜率为80.8%，接近人类水平（86.8%）。语言能力与战略推理能力相关。

Conclusion: Pok\'eAI展示了语言模型在游戏中的潜力，智能体表现出独特的战略行为，语言能力与游戏表现相关。

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

Motivation: AI在安全关键领域的快速发展缺乏安全性保障，需要结合控制理论和数据驱动方法来提升AI系统的安全性。

Method: 提出数据控制的新视角，通过系统理论和数据分析方法，结合控制理论和AI工程，为AI安全提供通用基础。

Result: 为AI安全分析和保障提供了一个抽象的通用框架，可针对具体系统和应用进行细化。

Conclusion: 数据控制的新视角为AI安全提供了跨学科的解决方案，并为未来创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Motivation: 传统方法在求解词方程时，处理顺序对性能影响较大，需优化。

Result: 实验表明，新框架在特定基准测试中优于现有求解器。

Conclusion: GNN排序方法有效提升词方程求解性能。

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Motivation: 解决多机器人轨迹规划问题，尤其是在大规模场景下，需要高效且可扩展的MAPF求解器。

Method: 利用中心化专家数据对预训练的MAPF-GPT模型进行微调，并引入delta-data生成机制加速训练。

Result: MAPF-GPT-DDG在测试中表现优于现有学习型MAPF求解器，支持单环境中多达100万个智能体的路径规划。

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG为MAPF领域提供了高性能和可扩展性的新解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective
reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a
unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes
(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,
and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety
across the agent's decision-making loop.

TL;DR: 论文主张AI系统需从统计学习转向精确学习以实现可靠的演绎推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的AI系统在演绎推理任务上表现不佳，无法实现通用人工智能。

Method: 提出从统计性能优化转向精确学习范式，要求在所有输入上正确。

Result: 统计学习方法导致不可靠的演绎推理行为。

Conclusion: 精确学习是实现可靠演绎推理的必要且可行的目标。

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在运筹学中解决随机建模问题的能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 手动收集研究生作业和博士资格考试题目，使用SimOpt库测试LLMs在不确定性下的决策能力。

Result: LLMs在课堂和实际场景中表现与人类专家相当，但仍需进一步工作以实现可靠的自动化。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力构建辅助运筹学研究的AI代理，通过自动化扩大OR的实际影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

Motivation: 工业链的弹性测量在科学管理和工程应用中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在复杂数据场景下泛化能力不足。

Method: 工业大脑框架整合了高阶神经驱动网络和CT-OODA符号推理，直接从观测数据中规划弹性。

Conclusion: 工业大脑填补了工业链弹性预测和规划的重要空白，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估决策算法处理非马尔可夫动态的能力，限制了相关系统的进展和效果。

Method: 建立了马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）和非马尔可夫决策过程（NMDP）的范畴，并证明其等价性；通过HAS引入非马尔可夫性。

Result: 方法能有效表示广泛的非马尔可夫动态，为决策算法提供了更严格和灵活的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和解决非马尔可夫动态提供了新视角，并提升了决策算法的评估能力。

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖人工标注和特定领域奖励设计，SPIRAL通过自我对弈消除这一需求，实现自主推理能力开发。

Method: SPIRAL采用多轮零和游戏自我对弈，结合在线多智能体强化学习系统和角色条件优势估计（RAE）稳定训练。

Result: 在Kuhn Poker上训练的模型在数学和通用推理任务中分别提升8.6%和8.4%，多游戏训练进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: 零和游戏能自然培养可迁移的推理能力，为自主推理发展提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

TL;DR: Interact2Vec是一种基于神经网络的推荐系统模型，仅需隐式反馈即可学习用户和物品的低维嵌入，在计算资源有限的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中高维稀疏数据问题，同时避免依赖复杂架构或内容数据。

Method: 采用类似自然语言处理的策略，同时学习用户和物品的分布式嵌入。

Result: 在30%的数据集中排名第二或第三，训练时间平均减少274%。

Conclusion: Interact2Vec在计算资源有限的情况下表现优异，是一种高效的嵌入生成模型。

Abstract: Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in
popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues,
such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items
as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading
solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches
rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be
available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model
that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while
demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies
that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training
phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted
regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we
benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a
top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms.
The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30\% of the datasets,
being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient
with an average training time reduction of 274\% compared to other
embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the
embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec
can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an
excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing
resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and
efficiently.

Abstract: We present Machine Assistant with Reliable Knowledge (MARK), a
retrieval-augmented question-answering system designed to support student
learning through accurate and contextually grounded responses. The system is
built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a
curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval
effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search
strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based
retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general
and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which
students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them.
Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling
adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting
as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a
broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support
by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its
ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains. MARK is
publicly accessible at https://app.eduquery.ai.

Motivation: 传统双塔模型在检索阶段难以覆盖多样化和长尾用户兴趣，导致偏差和低召回率。

Method: 使用可微分聚类模块（DCM）捕捉隐式兴趣，条件检索（CR）建模显式兴趣，结合两者生成多用户嵌入。

Result: 实验和A/B测试显示用户参与度和内容多样性显著提升。

Conclusion: 多嵌入框架成功应用于Pinterest首页推荐，有效解决了传统模型的局限性。

Abstract: Industrial recommendation systems are typically composed of multiple stages,
including retrieval, ranking, and blending. The retrieval stage plays a
critical role in generating a high-recall set of candidate items that covers a
wide range of diverse user interests. Effectively covering the diverse and
long-tail user interests within this stage poses a significant challenge:
traditional two-tower models struggle in this regard due to limited user-item
feature interaction and often bias towards top use cases. To address these
issues, we propose a novel multi-embedding retrieval framework designed to
enhance user interest representation by generating multiple user embeddings
conditioned on both implicit and explicit user interests. Implicit interests
are captured from user history through a Differentiable Clustering Module
(DCM), whereas explicit interests, such as topics that the user has followed,
are modeled via Conditional Retrieval (CR). These methodologies represent a
form of conditioned user representation learning that involves condition
representation construction and associating the target item with the relevant
conditions. Synergizing implicit and explicit user interests serves as a
complementary approach to achieve more effective and comprehensive candidate
retrieval as they benefit on different user segments and extract conditions
from different but supplementary sources. Extensive experiments and A/B testing
reveal significant improvements in user engagements and feed diversity metrics.
Our proposed framework has been successfully deployed on Pinterest home feed.

user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role
they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live

Result: 实验证明MTORL在离线和在线环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTORL有效解决了广告推荐中的稀疏性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant
attention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget
allocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL)
methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising
scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and
overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a
novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we
establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of
advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user
interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through
conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to
enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal
states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards,
simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation.
Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks
into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online
environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CoVE框架通过结合短期和长期偏好，有效提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: In the online digital realm, recommendation systems are ubiquitous and play a
crucial role in enhancing user experience. These systems leverage user
preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users
navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized
sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's
immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical
behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an
empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and
quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and
transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical
interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines
short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely
Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically
integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different
specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further
investigate the impact of variant expert types.

Result: 浅层数据集因提供更广泛的上下文而提升模型泛化能力；深层数据集的劣势可通过增加负训练样本缓解。

Conclusion: 浅层数据集更适合训练BERT重排序模型，但深层数据集的不足可通过调整训练策略改善。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of shallow versus deep relevance judgments
on the performance of BERT-based reranking models in neural Information
Retrieval. Shallow-judged datasets, characterized by numerous queries each with
few relevance judgments, and deep-judged datasets, involving fewer queries with
extensive relevance judgments, are compared. The research assesses how these
datasets affect the performance of BERT-based reranking models trained on them.
The experiments are run on the MS MARCO and LongEval collections. Results
indicate that shallow-judged datasets generally enhance generalization and
effectiveness of reranking models due to a broader range of available contexts.
The disadvantage of the deep-judged datasets might be mitigated by a larger
number of negative training examples.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可变展示长度排序任务（VLPL），解决了传统学习排序（LTR）方法中未考虑的文档展示长度对用户感知的影响问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LTR方法假设文档在排名中以相同格式展示，但用户对相关性的感知会因展示长度和形式变化而改变。

Method: 提出VLPL方法，结合Plackett-Luce模型，联合优化文档排序和展示长度。

Result: 实验表明，VLPL能有效平衡文档的曝光度和吸引力，性能优于固定长度模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了结合文档展示与LTR的重要性及挑战。

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K
ranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that
users' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,
allocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual
or image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect
attention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when
scrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a
fixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been
addressed by existing LTR methods.
  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking
task, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation
length is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show
that this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability
ranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem
cannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.
  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient
estimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.
Our semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the
expected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best
performance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that
even simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance
improvements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and
empirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining
document presentation with LTR.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，通过双语数据集训练多语言模型，提升非英语语言的工具调用能力，并以保加利亚语为例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言模型在非英语语言中工具调用能力不足，存在语言混淆问题，需要改进。

Method: 通过继续训练BgGPT系列模型，使用包含10,035个功能调用示例的双语数据集，支持标准化协议如MCP。

Result: 开发的TUCAN模型在功能调用准确性上提升了28.75%，同时保持了语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展工具增强能力至非英语系统提供了实用途径，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical
language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable
tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art
multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating
the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language
confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a
methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in
any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves
continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a
novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support
standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research
introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to
28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while
preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian
benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready
response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the
verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation
framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.
This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented
capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

*Gaurav Sehgal,Semih Salihoglu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NaviX是一个为图数据库管理系统设计的原生向量索引，支持联合查询向量嵌入与结构化数据，通过预过滤方法实现高效的kNN搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预测应用需要同时查询向量嵌入和结构化数据，现有系统缺乏高效支持此类联合查询的能力。

Method: 基于HNSW图结构，采用预过滤方法，设计自适应算法处理不同选择性和相关性。

Result: 实验证明NaviX在鲁棒性和效率上优于现有预过滤和后过滤基线方法。

Conclusion: NaviX为图数据库提供了高效的向量索引解决方案，支持复杂查询需求。

Abstract: There is an increasing demand for extending existing DBMSs with vector
indices so that they become unified systems capable of supporting modern
predictive applications, which require joint querying of vector embeddings
together with the structured properties and connections of objects. We present
NaviX, a native vector index for graph DBMSs (GDBMSs) that has two main design
goals. First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the
core storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS. To this
end, NaviX is built on the Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) graph,
which itself is a graph-based structure. Second, we aim to support
predicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest
neighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary
subset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS. We adopt a
prefiltering approach that evaluates QS first and passes the full description
of subset S to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering
search algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under
different correlations between subset S and query vector vQ. We propose an
adaptive algorithm that uses the local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW
graph to choose an appropriate heuristic at every iteration of the kNN search.
Finally, We demonstrate NaviX's robustness and efficiency through extensive
experiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based
baselines.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce industry has become integral to people's daily
lives, leveraging technological advancements to offer personalized shopping
experiences, primarily through recommendation systems that enhance customer
engagement through personalized suggestions. To improve customers' experience
in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for
outfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for
outfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item
retrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to
recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance
the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate
algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial
needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on
framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining
realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module
empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the
customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for
retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and
provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results
of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive
system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.

TL;DR: CAR是一种新的生成推荐方法，通过将语义和行为信息结合到单一的自回归模型中，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成推荐方法忽视了语义和行为之间的内在关系，限制了其潜力。CAR旨在通过结合语义和行为信息，提升推荐效果。

Method: CAR采用块级自回归方法，将语义ID（SIDs）和行为ID（UID）打包为统一表示，实现从“思考到行动”的双视角预测。

Result: CAR在Recall@5指标上比传统方法提升了7.93%至22.30%，并验证了模型性能与SIDs位数的缩放效应。

Conclusion: CAR不仅显著提升了推荐性能，还初步模拟了类似于大语言模型的慢思考机制。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) typically encodes behavioral or semantic
aspects of item information into discrete tokens, leveraging the standard
autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm to make predictions. However, existing
methods tend to overlook their intrinsic relationship, that is, the semantic
usually provides some reasonable explainability "$\textbf{why}$" for the
behavior "$\textbf{what}$", which may constrain the full potential of GR. To
this end, we present Chunk AutoRegressive Modeling (CAR), a new generation
paradigm following the decision pattern that users usually think semantic
aspects of items (e.g. brand) and then take actions on target items (e.g.
purchase). Our CAR, for the $\textit{first time}$, incorporates semantics
(SIDs) and behavior (UID) into a single autoregressive transformer from an
``act-with-think'' dual perspective via chunk-level autoregression.
Specifically, CAR packs SIDs and UID into a conceptual chunk for item unified
representation, allowing each decoding step to make a holistic prediction.
Experiments show that our CAR significantly outperforms existing methods based
on traditional AR, improving Recall@5 by 7.93% to 22.30%. Furthermore, we
verify the scaling effect between model performance and SIDs bit number,
demonstrating that CAR preliminary emulates a kind of slow-thinking style
mechanism akin to the reasoning processes observed in large language models
(LLMs).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于阈值距离加权损失（TDW）的张量潜在分解模型（TDWLFT），用于解决交通数据缺失问题，并在预测精度和计算效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统（ITS）依赖高质量时空交通数据，但实际数据常因通信故障或传感器故障而缺失或损坏。现有张量潜在分解模型（LFT）对异常值敏感，需改进。

Method: 提出TDWLFT模型，通过阈值距离加权损失函数减少对异常值的敏感性，为不同样本分配差异化权重。

Result: 在两个城市交通速度数据集上的实验表明，TDWLFT在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TDWLFT模型有效解决了传统LFT对异常值敏感的问题，提升了交通数据缺失填补的性能。

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and
high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.
Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as
communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or
corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of
ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the
model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to
individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed
datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed
TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RL-Net是透明性和性能之间的实用折中方案，展示了神经符号模型在可解释AI中的潜力。

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data,
while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This
work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net
that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for
the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark
RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable
black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user
adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a
favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while
significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges
specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing
modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical
middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the
real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and
offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing
systems.

Conclusion: 研究目标是通过改进风险预测和进展事件识别，优化SARS-CoV-2患者的护理和决策。

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC,
pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate
identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection,
is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However,
traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced

with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and
enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The
ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的HAMARL框架，通过分层多智能体强化学习和对抗训练提升CPS的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS在多个关键领域广泛应用，但其高连通性使其易受复杂网络攻击，传统安全方法效果有限。

Method: HAMARL采用分层结构，包括本地子系统和全局协调器，并结合对抗训练模拟威胁。

Result: 实验表明HAMARL显著优于传统方法，提高了攻击检测准确性和响应速度。

Conclusion: 分层多智能体协调与对抗训练结合可有效增强CPS的安全性和韧性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一种新型深度学习框架，通过注意力机制和多模态融合解决癌症生存预测中的计算和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态融合、计算需求和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了临床应用的潜力。

Method: EAGLE采用动态跨模态注意力机制、维度压缩、三种归因方法和统一管道，实现高效预测和可解释性。

Result: 在911名患者中验证，EAGLE能识别高风险群体并显著区分生存期，为治疗决策提供依据。

Conclusion: EAGLE结合高性能和临床可解释性，为多模态生存预测提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的多任务、多变量架构（1EMD），用于联合预测三个关键气候变量，优于单变量方法并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球气候模型（GCMs）分辨率低，区域气候模型（RCMs）计算成本高且灵活性有限，现有深度学习方法多为单变量模型，缺乏上下文意识和变量间交互。

Method: 采用共享编码器和变量特定解码器的ViT架构，联合预测表面温度、风速和500 hPa位势高度，直接从GCM分辨率输入模拟RCM尺度降尺度。

Result: 多变量方法实现了跨变量知识转移，性能优于单变量基线，同时提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多变量建模在高分辨率气候降尺度中具有有效性。

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

successfully improves stability in terms of the temperature control by about 3
times compared to ordinary solvers.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph
Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by
representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models
typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training
separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and
reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining
approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that
aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level,
link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic
heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective
pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient
sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our
preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the
pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the
promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations
for relational data.

Result: 研究表明，未训练策略会产生相关动作，并导致非平凡的状态访问分布，为探索行为提供了新的理论框架。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用策略初始化作为设计工具提供了理论和实验基础，有助于理解早期训练中的探索行为。

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior
in early training.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLM）与人类价值观对齐的新方法，揭示RLHF和DPO的互信息联系。

Result: MIO在推理和数学任务中表现优于DPO，解决了其后期性能下降问题。

Conclusion: MIO为LLM对齐提供了新思路，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

<details>

Motivation: 迁移学习可降低模型训练的计算成本，但对抗性训练仍耗时。FGSM在对抗性微调中表现出稳定性，有望成为高效替代方案。

Method: 研究FGSM在对抗性微调中的表现，并与PGD对比，评估其在多个数据集上的稳定性和性能。

Result: FGSM在ε=4和ε=8时仅损失少量鲁棒性（0.39%和1.39%），且训练时间减少4倍。

Conclusion: FGSM在对抗性鲁棒迁移学习中不仅高效，且性能接近PGD，是可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model
training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the
features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new
task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as
adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.
However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial
training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of
magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use
of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve
the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that
FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from
scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with
catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or
$\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for
linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance
across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used
method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%
and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using
$4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a
significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust
transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature
domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured.
These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and
optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input
spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical.
A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other
decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical
structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose
activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable
hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining
principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition
of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system
architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such
domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient
modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the
open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are
demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system
design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Result: 算法计算复杂度为$O(T\ln T)$，动态遗憾为$O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} + \sqrt{T}\ln T)$。

Conclusion: H-VAW-D算法在非参数域中实现了动态遗憾最优，具有高效的计算复杂度。

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic
loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a
discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic
regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to
the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random
feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm,
which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that
learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove
that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of
$O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} +
\sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator
sequence.

Result: 数学推理任务依赖特定层，移除会导致准确性大幅下降；非数学任务则无此现象。

Conclusion: 数学推理需要预训练中形成的专用层，而非推理任务则不需要。

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems
dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering
applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods
rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in
real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning
framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order
models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems.
Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and
reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared
to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its
performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training
dataset.

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the
resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant
computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires
discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional
state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic
multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly
from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while
introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We
learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free
amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from
physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in
fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies
to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive
accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at
equivalent resolution.

Conclusion: DistShap为大规模GNN提供高效的解释方法。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative
personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept
($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to
dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only
reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$
wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms
such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail
to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the
learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in
direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained
embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing
problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization
methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in
diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at

Motivation: 改进Transformer中残差流的信息存储和检索机制，以提升模型性能和效率。

Method: 用外积记忆矩阵（Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972）替换Transformer的残差流，构建RMT模型。

Result: RMT在性能上优于Transformer，减少了58%的FLOPS、25%的参数和41%的训练token，同时在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: RMT通过更高效的残差流扩展和方差传播特性，为Transformer提供了一种更优的替代方案。

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

Result: 代理在模拟 P2P 微电网中实现了公平交易，满足 90% 以上买方需求，公平性评分高于 0.80。

Conclusion: FairMarket-RL 为去中心化能源系统中的自主交易提供了可扩展的公平驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for
decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust
frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel
hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P
microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time
fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:
Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness
scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled
{\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that
replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,
fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and
consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process
demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer
shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its
language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a
large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its
practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven
solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

Result: 该框架首次在独立训练的Vision Transformers和GPT-2模型之间发现了低或零障碍的线性插值路径。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了损失景观的更深层次结构，并强调了对称性分析在理解模型空间几何中的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central
question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and
optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where
independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,
despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often
obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --
which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has
predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such
approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries
exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we
introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:
permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general
invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and
subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this
generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and
zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision
Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the
loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for
understanding model space geometry.

Result: 实验显示，该方法可节省高达60%的成本，性能下降不到1%。

Conclusion: BEST-Route在保持性能的同时显著降低成本，为LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences
dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions
and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are
essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.
while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are
incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios
involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust
Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately
modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is
often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the
suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model
accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2
norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective
low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,
we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor
L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear
L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via
Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully
exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off
parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of
missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery
scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限设备提供了一种高效且低内存占用的训练方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm
that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by
learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of
the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained,
score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable
zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises
a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned
distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given
the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we
apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical
system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally
observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis
on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also
provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that
generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a
coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental
observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery
of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity
measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the
influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度循环神经网络的新方法，用于估计1990年至今230个国家和地区之间的年度移民流动和存量数据，并提供置信区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供更全面、高分辨率的移民数据，填补传统方法在时间和空间上的不足。

Method: 使用深度循环神经网络，结合18种协变量（地理、经济、文化等）训练模型，并通过集成网络和不确定性传播获得置信区间。

Result: 模型在未见数据上表现优于传统方法，显著提高了时间分辨率，并公开了所有数据和代码。

Conclusion: 该方法为移民研究提供了高质量、可验证的数据资源，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

TL;DR: xLSTMAD是一种基于xLSTM架构的异常检测方法，首次将xLSTM应用于多变量时间序列数据的异常检测，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管xLSTM在时间序列预测等任务中表现出色，但尚未有人将其用于异常检测，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 提出xLSTMAD，包含编码器和两种解码器变体（预测xLSTMAD-F和重建xLSTMAD-R），并研究MSE和SoftDTW两种损失函数。

Result: 在TSB-AD-M基准测试中，xLSTMAD优于23种基线方法，展示了xLSTM在异常检测中的强大能力。

Conclusion: xLSTMAD为异常检测开辟了新方向，展示了xLSTM的潜力，未来可进一步探索。

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 该研究为能源领域的研究者提供了将量子机器学习应用于实际问题的有价值见解。

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine
learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

Motivation: 解决现有分治策略（D&D）在大规模BN结构学习中子问题学习准确性不稳定的问题。

Method: 结合多种BN结构学习算法构建SLE，并自动学习最优SLE（Auto-SLE），将其集成到D&D方法中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在涉及10,000变量的数据集上准确率提升30%~225%，并能泛化到更多变量（如30,000）和不同网络特性的数据集。

Conclusion: SLE及其自动学习方法（Auto-SLE）在大规模BN结构学习中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently
proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&D) strategies present a promising approach for
learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning
accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing
structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Result: 在多种模型架构和数据集上验证了P$^2$U在精度、带宽和延迟之间的优越平衡，支持激进量化（如4位）而不显著影响性能。

Conclusion: P$^2$U是一种高效且实用的模型分发解决方案，适用于联邦学习、边缘计算和物联网等低资源场景，并可与其他压缩技术结合使用。

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in
bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this
problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U
transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing
the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted
low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model
architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a
large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data
sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U
consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and
latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,
aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising
performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical
solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource
settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.
Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be
implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,
quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

Conclusion: 该方法在时间序列分析中具有高效性和可解释性，适用于大规模问题，并能揭示复杂时空模式。

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

Motivation: 多模态生物数据中常见模态缺失问题，现有方法难以应对多样化的缺失模式和模态数量增加带来的复杂性。

Method: 提出MAGNET模型，利用患者-模态多头注意力机制融合低维模态嵌入，构建患者图结构，并通过图神经网络进行预测。

Result: 在三个公共多组学数据集上的实验表明，MAGNET优于现有融合方法。

Conclusion: MAGNET能有效处理缺失模态问题，复杂度线性增长，适应性强。

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

that time series generation based on natural language is possible. The proposed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO算法中因生成和存储多响应导致的高内存开销问题，提升在有限硬件条件下的可扩展性。

Method: 提出微采样组、连续采样和长度感知调度器，结合FPTAS和SJF优化内存和效率。

Result: 微采样组减少峰值内存50%以上，Infinite Sampling提升吞吐量25%，同时保持完整响应生成。

Conclusion: Infinite Sampling框架在有限GPU内存下实现了高效稳定的GRPO训练，支持更大组规模。

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy
Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses
per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group
size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable
GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of:
(1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible
rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to
improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining
token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global
grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by
over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on
Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over
25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps
while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid
scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under
realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be
susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental
disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating
vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical
vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position,
speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized
machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns.
First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture
temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model
processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors.
Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by
offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and
performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746,
and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model
attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly
threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in
accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in

Abstract: A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is
proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in
high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing
methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters
that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a
projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions
to search over, and a new way to combine results of different direction types.
This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our
empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small
datasets with challenging structures, and on four large benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming
traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing
decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a
promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation,
storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management.
Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and
storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production,
consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the
energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a
realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through
an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the
Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy
outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust

TL;DR: 论文提出Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer)以解决PINNs在求解PDE时的精度限制问题，通过多项式插值显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在求解PDE时精度不足，研究目标是确定精度限制源于PDE的病态性还是MLP架构。

Method: 引入BWLer，通过多项式插值建模PDE解，可叠加于MLP或完全替代MLP。

Result: BWLer显著提升精度，在多个PDE基准测试中表现优异，甚至接近机器精度。

Conclusion: BWLer结合了PINNs的灵活性和经典谱求解器的精度，为高精度PDE求解提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种特征混合框架来减少机器学习模型中的偏差，通过重新分配特征表示，显著降低了偏差并提高了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏差缓解方法存在可扩展性和泛化性限制，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用特征混合框架，通过交叉验证训练四种分类器，并使用偏差敏感损失函数评估。

Result: 平均偏差减少43.35%，预测性能显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 特征混合是一种高效且无需明确偏差属性的方法，未来可应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge
due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing
mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.
However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability
and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a
feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by
redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To
assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained
using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,
including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a
standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an
average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in
MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,
benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that
feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and
demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias
attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the
computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning
algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for
real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Motivation: 受神经科学中突触可塑性的启发，研究旨在通过内外部压力测试RL策略的鲁棒性，并识别关键参数类型。

Method: 引入突触过滤（内部压力）和对抗攻击（外部压力），定义参数评分以量化其脆弱性、鲁棒性或反脆弱性。

Result: 在Mujoco连续控制环境中验证了框架，发现反脆弱参数能提升策略在压力下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究为设计鲁棒且反脆弱的RL系统提供了基础，展示了针对性过滤技术的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by
systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external
stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering
introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while
adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations.
This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust,
or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and
adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these
characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco
continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of
antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,
demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL
policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future
advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Result: 该方法使小规模学生模型能够从最强的预训练模型中受益。

Conclusion: 通过互信息优化和MLP块重加权，有效提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Result: 实验表明，残差块的策略性放置显著提升了QuNNs的训练效率和性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子深度学习的发展提供了新方向，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of
Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional
layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional
quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely
been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our
research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,
significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the
introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities
in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing
gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel
architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging
the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by
adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between
quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the
network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide
empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within
QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient
configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers
in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings
suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in
maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step
forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for
both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

Motivation: 空气质量预测具有时空复杂性和不确定性，现有方法在确定性与随机性之间的平衡上仍有不足。

Method: 提出Double-Diffusion模型，利用已知物理知识引导随机性预测，并采用图像恢复中的采样策略和新去噪架构。

Result: 在多个评估场景中表现最佳，推理时间减少30%-50%，CRPS提升3%-12%。

Conclusion: Double-Diffusion首次将物理知识作为条件生成方法应用于空气质量预测，显著优于现有概率模型。

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its
spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty.
Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural
Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through
probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right
balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open
question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion
probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air
quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while
precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air
pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative
approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted
from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks
first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with
other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while
enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score
(CRPS).

Result: GPT-4的分类准确率为66.2%，显著优于GPT-3.5（55.9%）和BERT（48.1%），且其语义相似性与人类反应相关。

Conclusion: 现代大型语言模型能够以可测量的准确度近似人类心理概念，为开发更可解释的AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

Result: 在合成任务和机器人手臂操作任务中，该方法能有效捕捉因果动态变化并泛化到新场景。

Conclusion: 元因果图是一种高效的世界模型表示方法，能适应动态因果机制的变化。

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

Result: Forget-MI在遗忘数据集上表现优异，降低了MIA攻击能力，同时测试集性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: Forget-MI有效解决了多模态医疗数据遗忘问题，平衡了隐私保护与模型性能。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The
newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows
learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees
under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy
optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making
use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)
and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian
representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance
as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence
rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we
obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate.
Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in
constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are
observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation
algorithms.

Conclusion: 通过量化合成数据质量并优化其使用，可以有效提升无线传感任务的性能。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Conclusion: GAMA提升了生成模型的可解释性，支持无负样本的序列设计验证。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding
notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning
community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph
halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a
$2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent
monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this
decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various
learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably,
we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and
proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently
learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the
realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature,
and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said
learning problems are NP-hard.

Conclusion: M2oE2通过动态适应外部数据，为负荷预测提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system
reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility.
However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors,
such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their
heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information.
We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to
dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a
meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected
parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external
conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further
integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through
selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant
external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for
External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and
robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

Method: 基于Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)的假设，提出SGKI方法，扩展了现有的核方法，利用Schur补高效计算非渐近置信带。

Result: SGKI不仅能估计缺失像素，还能为所有缺失像素构建同时保证的非渐近置信带，并在合成和基准图像数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SGKI方法在图像修复和超分辨率任务中表现优越，提供了可靠的像素估计和不确定性量化。

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Masked Gated Linear Units (MGLUs)的新型门控线性单元，通过共享权重矩阵和高效内核实现，显著减少了内存读取和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有门控线性单元（GLUs）在大型语言模型中需要双倍内存读取，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入MGLUs，包括Mixture of Element-wise Gating (MoEG)架构和FlashMGLU内核，通过共享权重矩阵和二进制掩码减少内存传输。

Result: 实验显示，FlashMGLU在RTX5090 GPU上比标准GLUs快34%，内存效率提高47%，SwiMGLU变体在保持内存优势的同时性能优于基线。

Conclusion: MGLUs通过高效设计和硬件优化，显著提升了门控线性单元的性能和效率。

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

TL;DR: Sub-MoE是一种通过子空间专家合并压缩MoE模型的新框架，解决了参数冲突问题，显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型因参数规模庞大导致的内存、存储和部署挑战，以及现有专家合并方法因参数冲突而受限的问题。

Method: 通过自适应专家聚类和子空间专家合并两阶段方法，利用SVD提取共享U矩阵并合并专家特定V矩阵。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上显著优于现有方法，Mixtral-8x7B在减少25%|50%专家时保持96%|86%性能。

Conclusion: Sub-MoE有效解决了专家合并中的参数冲突问题，为MoE模型压缩提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive
parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges.
Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by
consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter
conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present
Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key
insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated
expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared
$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$
components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)
Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via
K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)
Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to
derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues
frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert
reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse
experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression
for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,
and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms
existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains
96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on
Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但其思考时间不可预测，可能导致用户挫败感。

Method: 引入并评估了在线和离线预测模型思考时间的方法。

Result: 提出了实用的“推理进度条”概念。

Conclusion: 研究对用户体验和未来研究方向有重要意义。

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法（BAPE），通过显式建模后验概率参数并直接学习贝叶斯分类器，解决了长尾数据分布中的梯度不平衡问题，同时确保贝叶斯最优决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习算法通过隐式估计后验概率（如最小化Softmax交叉熵损失）在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在长尾数据分布中会导致梯度不平衡问题，无法确保贝叶斯最优决策。

Method: BAPE方法显式建模后验概率参数，通过点估计直接学习贝叶斯分类器，避免了梯度下降，并提出了一种分布调整技术以适应任意不平衡的测试数据分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、CIFAR-100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist等数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了深度网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: BAPE方法通过显式建模后验概率和分布调整技术，有效解决了长尾数据分布中的问题，且与现有方法正交，具有简单高效的特点。

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal
approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep
learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by
\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by
minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been
proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.
However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real
world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the
Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of
the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the
posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,
our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based
on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and
ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a
straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This
method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set
to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance
factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional
computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are
orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they
are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the
posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT,
CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks,
despite its simplicity.

Motivation: 探讨深度学习研究中反直觉现象的解释是否具有实际价值，避免低效研究。

Method: 分析文献中的典型案例，提出研究建议。

Result: 反直觉现象的研究对理论验证有价值，但需与实际应用结合。

Conclusion: 建议将现象研究作为理论工具，以推动深度学习领域的实际进展。

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Motivation: 单细胞研究中，传统方法和现有VAEs在建模层次数据时存在计算成本高、性能不足、生成能力有限和稳定性差的问题。

Method: HDTree通过统一的层次码本和量化扩散过程建模树节点转换，消除了分支特定模块的需求，并通过扩散过程模拟渐进的层次变化。

Result: 在通用和单细胞数据集上，HDTree在准确性和性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HDTree为层次谱系分析提供了新工具，能更准确高效地建模细胞分化路径，并为下游生物任务提供见解。

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

Motivation: 随着数据为中心机器学习的兴起，数据估值方法被用于公平补偿数据所有者，但其偏见和不稳定性可能带来技术和伦理问题。

Method: 通过分析9个表格分类数据集和6种数据估值方法，研究数据预处理、子采样和估值偏差对结果的影响。

Result: 研究发现数据估值方法易受预处理技术影响，可能加剧类别不平衡，并低估少数群体数据的价值。

Conclusion: 提出DValCards框架以提高数据估值的透明度，减少误用并促进可信的机器学习系统。

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML),
various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution
of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data
cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the
context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly
compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are
inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices,
resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular
classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1)
common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter
estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase
class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented
group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency
associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data
Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of
DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data
pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

Conclusion: FTS提供强隐私保护、可扩展性和多样化医疗任务支持。

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

Motivation: 传统加性噪声模型（ANM）在存在未观测中介变量时失效，现有解决方案在有限样本下表现不稳定，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出BiDD方法，通过噪声和去噪过程中的独立性检验统计量来推断因果方向，而非传统的均方误差比较。

Conclusion: BiDD是一种有效的因果发现方法，适用于存在未观测中介变量的场景，且在无中介变量时仍表现良好。

Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a
foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional
assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable
sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based
methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between
variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously
characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of
unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden
mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical
utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)
for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by
unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through
mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel
independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for
each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the
independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic
consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under
hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted
settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

Conclusion: 结合逻辑推理模块的LLMs增强了系统可靠性和可解释性，为复杂领域的可信AI提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of
artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic
orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic
inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical
reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper
investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that
augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging
Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and
explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries
into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common
failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We
demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through
experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and
system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that
combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor,
enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy,
interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算科学中基准数据集的稀缺性，评估新方法变得困难，因此需要一种工具将现有科学数据集转化为基准测试集。

Method: 使用非负矩阵分解确定边缘案例，并在凸包上分区数据集，生成测试集以最大化差异和统计显著性。

Conclusion: BenchMake为计算科学提供了一种有效的基准测试生成工具，适用于多种数据类型。

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有非平稳性，这会降低预训练预测模型的性能。现有的测试时适应方法通常更新整个模型，增加了内存和计算成本。

Method: PETSA使用低秩适配器和动态门控调整表示，无需重新训练。通过结合鲁棒项、频域项和块状结构项的专业损失函数，保持准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，PETSA在各种预测骨干模型上提高了适应性，且参数需求少于基线方法。

Conclusion: PETSA在基准数据集上表现出色，性能优于或与现有方法相当，同时更高效。

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive
or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有方法将用户活动视为孤立事件，忽略了行为序列的依赖性，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: 采用User-Based Sequencing (UBS)方法将数据转化为时间序列，使用Transformer Encoder建模正常行为，并通过重建误差作为异常分数，结合三种无监督异常检测算法进行评估。

Result: 在多个测试集上表现优异，准确率96.61%，召回率99.43%，F1-score 96.38%，AUROC 95.00%，假阴性和假阳性率极低。

Conclusion: 该方法通过序列建模和先进异常检测技术，显著提升了内部威胁检测的性能。

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized
status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing
machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby
failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we
propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT
insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep
sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model
benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores.
These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier
detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and
Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets,
including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer
pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61%
accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low
false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and
conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential
user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督方法在同时检测属性和结构异常时存在性能不足的问题，TripleAD旨在通过多通道设计解决这一挑战。

Conclusion: TripleAD通过多通道和互蒸馏策略，有效提升了图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and
economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses.
Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of
detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the
tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in
suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual
distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It
includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and
mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of
anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation
module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing
issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced
structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information
flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an
attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and
structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual
distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and
collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

*Haolan Guo,Linwei Tao,Haoyang Luo,Minjing Dong,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级、数据高效的校准方法SMART，通过基于logit间隙的精确调整，解决了神经网络过度自信的问题，并在有限数据下实现了最佳校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络存在系统性过度自信的问题，现有校准方法在全局调整和表达性方法之间存在偏差和方差的权衡，需要一种更高效、稳健的解决方案。

Method: SMART通过logit间隙（top两个logit的差值）作为去噪信号，结合软分箱的Expected Calibration Error目标（SoftECE），实现高效校准。

Result: SMART在多种数据集和架构上表现出色，即使参数较少，也能达到最优校准性能。

Conclusion: SMART为神经网络预测的不确定性量化提供了一种高效、稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性和通信限制导致的性能下降问题。

Result: 在多种挑战性联邦学习场景中，FedWSQ表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedWSQ有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性和通信效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了动量方法在深度神经网络中的有效性，提出了一种广义动量方法QHM，并通过实验表明增加批量大小而非降低学习率能更有效地训练神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动量方法在随机非凸优化（如深度神经网络）中的理论支持不足，QHM作为一种广义动量方法，旨在更好地理解其有效性。

Method: 研究了小批量QHM在批量大小增加时的收敛性，分析了学习率衰减和批量大小增加对收敛的影响。

Result: 实验表明，增加批量大小而非降低学习率能更有效地实现收敛，且有限的批量增加对神经网络训练有益。

Conclusion: 在非渐近收敛中，增加批量大小是比降低学习率更有效的策略，为动量方法在深度学习的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex
objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep
neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization
-- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings
remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that
generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand
the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide
both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with
an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence
requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a
decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we
demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without
decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments
show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for
training neural networks.

Result: 证明了多种Transformer架构的UAP，包括基于核和稀疏注意力的机制，并推广了先前结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计具有UAP保证的新型Transformer架构提供了理论基础，并通过示例展示了其应用。

Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type
architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior
results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our
work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP
and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of
architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we
can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a
non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers
with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention
mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or
establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our
framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer
architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific
functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型在媒体生成方面取得了显著进展，但其设计空间已较为成熟，限制了进一步改进。同时，连续自回归模型在统一文本和媒体生成方面显示出潜力。

Method: TM将复杂生成任务分解为简单的马尔可夫转移，支持非确定性概率转移核和任意非连续监督过程。提出了三种变体：DTM、ARTM和FHTM。

Result: DTM在图像质量和文本一致性上达到最优，采样效率提升；ARTM和FHTM在连续因果自回归生成中与非因果方法表现相当，FHTM首次在文本到图像任务中超越流方法。

Conclusion: TM为生成模型提供了新的灵活设计空间，并在多个任务中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

Motivation: 现有方法无法准确预测未来异常时间点，A2P旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用AAF学习异常关系，SAP通过APP模拟多样异常模式。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: A2P能有效预测未来异常，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合非线性低秩表示模型（NLR）和卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法，用于填补水质数据（WQD）中的缺失值，显著提升了填补精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质监测数据常因传感器故障和通信延迟等问题导致大量缺失，传统填补方法难以捕捉数据的潜在动态和深层特征。

Result: 在三个真实水质数据集上的实验表明，该方法在估计精度上显著优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态环境中的水质监测数据处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Transformer通过专用计算电路学习模算术，为更高效和可解释的神经方法铺平道路。

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches
to modular exponentiation.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free
method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters
and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of
hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete
and continuous weights, for deterministic and stochastic spiking networks,
using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the
algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without
requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The
classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient
training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event
logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand
models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process
executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable
process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning
traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process
models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process
model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or
probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to
capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace
clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.
Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on
directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows
clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's
process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given
stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales
linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing
clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public
real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in
representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings
can shift when stochasticity is considered.

Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）的置信度估计与实际预测准确性不一致，限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用。现有方法依赖粗粒度统计或节点嵌入，忽略了图拓扑的细粒度结构异质性。

Method: 提出WATS框架，利用可调热核图小波特征为节点分配特定温度，无需重新训练模型或访问邻居的预测信息。

Result: 在七个基准数据集和两种GNN架构上，WATS的预期校准误差（ECE）最低，比基线方法降低42.3%，校准方差平均减少17.24%。

Conclusion: WATS通过图小波特征有效提升了GNN的校准性能，且计算高效，适用于不同规模和密度的图。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

Method: KAIROS利用MMD（最大均值差异）为每个训练样本分配分布影响评分，无需重新训练，支持高效在线更新。

Result: 在噪声、错误标注和中毒基准测试中，KAIROS在准确性和运行时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KAIROS提供了一种高效、准确的数据估值方法，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

### [230] [Towards the Training of Deeper Predictive Coding Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23800)
*Chang Qi,Matteo Forasassi,Thomas Lukasiewicz,Tommaso Salvatori*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预测编码网络在深度超过五到七层时性能显著下降的问题，探索深层网络训练的有效方法。

Method: 引入两种优化潜在变量的方法，使用精度加权重新平衡能量分布；提出新的权重更新机制减少深层误差积累。

Result: 在多个图像分类任务中测试，深层网络（超过七层）的测试准确率大幅提升，性能接近反向传播模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，理解松弛阶段对均衡传播训练的重要性，为复杂任务中的应用提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural
models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process.
Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow
architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds
five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this
degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during
weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in
guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two
novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to
re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation
phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that
reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods
on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large
improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with
performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings
suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to
train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities
for their application in complex tasks.

Motivation: 设计一个能够在线学习数据生成过程的正常行为并动态适应行为变化的框架，以准确识别异常点模式。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量模拟实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效适应数据行为变化并准确检测异常点模式。

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework
specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS)
observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data
(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the
expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this
study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not
only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also
dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point
patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior
distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate
adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of
point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative
and quantitative simulation experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SGD与自适应预处理的结合，以提升收敛性并解释Adam等算法的实际效率。

Method: 开发了统一的收敛性分析框架，涵盖多种自适应梯度方法，并引入Nesterov动量加速。

Result: 证明了AdaGrad和DASGO的收敛速度可超越已知最佳速率，并首次为DASGO提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: AdaGrad型算法可以同时受益于对角预处理和动量，这可能是Adam实际高效的根本原因。

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type
preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified
convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or
matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover
state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient
methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In
addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed
algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for
the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and
DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov
momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that
AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal
preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the
practical efficiency of Adam.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过显式聚类假设简化了半监督学习，并展示了其兼容性和性能优势。

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Result: EFPI能有效识别阵型并支持不同时间段的稳定性分析，代码已开源。

Conclusion: EFPI为足球战术分析提供了灵活且稳定的阵型识别工具。

Abstract: Understanding team formations and player positioning is crucial for tactical
analysis in football (soccer). This paper presents a flexible method for
formation recognition and player position assignment in football using
predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal
tracking data, called EFPI. Our approach employs linear sum assignment to
optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by
minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template
positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment
cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the
dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the
method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to
larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific
intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we
incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation
changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments.
EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

Motivation: 调和关于SAEs的争议，明确其适用场景。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate
regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting
information about their internal physiological states and surrounding
conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into
biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow
between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a
plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's
electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor
environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.
Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and
automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high
performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks.
AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of
statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system
monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This
work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid
systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 探索中间步骤的顺序如何影响Transformer的推理难度，并寻找学习友好的顺序。

Method: 通过训练Transformer在不同顺序的目标序列上，识别早期损失下降快的顺序，并采用两阶段分层方法进行块间和块内重新排序。

Result: 在四个顺序敏感的算术任务中，方法从数十亿候选顺序中找到了学习友好的顺序，并在乘法任务中恢复了先前研究的逆序数字顺序。

Conclusion: 研究表明，重新排序输入令牌的顺序可以显著提升Transformer在算术任务中的学习效率。

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare
due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by
transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user
manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study
in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for
communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the
accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available
in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local
populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context).
The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our
open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to
other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed
to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for
prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users --
such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical
equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive
accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic
understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and
multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility
to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering
patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Result: 评估结果显示ADReFT在修复性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADReFT通过自适应修复策略显著提升了自动驾驶系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic
simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in
chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and
semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family
of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed,
accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique
3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data
across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We
develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model
capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and
medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of
linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing
speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active
parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of
applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model
without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized
models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to
accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to
build increasingly capable AI models.

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet上实现了竞争性精度，显著提升了Lipschitz边界和运行时性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为Lipschitz约束神经网络的训练提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks
(NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such
guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network.
However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from
non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global
semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training
framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite
relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a
convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.
While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is
limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized
subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the
global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto
low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training
objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly
improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

Conclusion: TTA-VLM为TTA方法提供了公平比较和全面评估，鼓励开发更可靠和通用的策略。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical
performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement
learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free
settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational
intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness
and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant
of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates
sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic
tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where
$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode
length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a
logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the
optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance
compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and
Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

Result: 建立了方法层次结构，发现高表达能力模型在对称性高的场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 链接表达能力在复杂场景中至关重要，需根据数据集特性选择模型。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Method: 提出基于高阶ODE求解器的采样算法，利用拉格朗日插值和逐步细化近似概率流ODE的积分。

Result: 算法在精确评分下仅需$d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K}$次评估（对数因子内），适用于广泛数据分布。

Conclusion: 该方法在评分估计误差增加时仍表现稳健，无需高阶平滑假设，优于先前工作。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Result: 研究结果为优化合成数据在训练中的使用提供了见解，提升了模型的鲁棒性和效果。

Conclusion: 混合策略能有效缩小域间差距，但需根据任务和架构调整数据比例。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

Result: 在多个短期和长期预测基准测试中，该方法显著优于单模态和跨模态基线。

Conclusion: 多模态对齐能有效增强时间序列预测，证明了视觉和文本模态互补的优势。

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文挑战了对比自监督学习（SSL）在局部音乐信息检索（MIR）任务中表现不佳的假设，展示了其与Transformer结合的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对比自监督学习在局部MIR任务中的表现，打破传统认为其仅适用于全局任务的观念。

Method: 使用轻量级一维视觉Transformer（ViT-1D）和简单的对比SSL（NT-Xent损失）进行训练。

Result: 序列令牌在局部任务中表现意外出色，且不同层捕捉了不同的音乐特征。

Conclusion: 对比SSL与Transformer结合在MIR中具有潜力，为音乐理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning
for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as
automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is
widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised
models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,
masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the
potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We
consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the
time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL
through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although
NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks
to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence
tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens
offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful
properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform
unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,
high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention
maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different
musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but
advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some
overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence
modeling in MIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为第二语言学习者提供更清晰的语音输出，解决传统TTS系统在L2语境下的不足。

Method: 利用美国英语中紧张元音和松弛元音的时长差异，设计了一种“清晰模式”的Matcha-TTS系统。

Result: 法语母语的英语L2学习者在清晰模式下转录错误减少至少9.15%，且认为该模式更鼓励和尊重，但未意识到其实际效果。

Conclusion: 实际清晰度与感知清晰度不相关，且现有ASR系统（如Whisper）无法准确评估L2学习者的语音理解需求。

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Conclusion: TinyWave适用于实时对话代理、辅助技术和低资源环境，并开源了模型和代码以支持可复现研究。

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of
many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation
models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention
maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with
minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter
models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on
50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation
using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations.
Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity
points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97%
of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These
models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling
applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and
low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation

Result: 在三个数据集上，WavShape将嵌入与敏感属性的互信息减少81%，同时保留97%的任务相关信息。

Conclusion: 结合信息论与自监督语音模型，WavShape推动了公平、隐私保护且高效的语音系统发展。

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity,
accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and
privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech
representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and
privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual
information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an
MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while
maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results
on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and
sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant
information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech
models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and

Result: 实验表明，TOMI生成的电子音乐在质量和结构连贯性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TOMI为音乐生成提供了一种新的层次化方法，支持人机交互创作，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences
structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of
music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy,
which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately
organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To
this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a
novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via
instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track
composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips
(short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks
(instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is
capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure,
and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio
workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with
stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Conclusion: XY-Tokenizer成功平衡了语义和声学性能，为语音语言模型提供了更优的编解码方案。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language
models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve
acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,
existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction
with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic
fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict
between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task
learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves
performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of
state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those
existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer
achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling
methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker
similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The
reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,
the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a
speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the
integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring
systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are
limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational
demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces
E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework,
specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated
subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across
multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The
experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and
real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses
exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into
the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct
spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real
time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection
metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results
demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research
domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based
audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

Method: HGM利用余弦相似性评估当前梯度与累积动量的方向一致性，动态调整学习率：方向一致时增加学习率，不一致时减少学习率。

RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often
overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional
information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates,
which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path.
HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the
cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This
allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,
increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of
oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that
accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining
stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability,
the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing
optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the
optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over
existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep
neural network training.

### [262] [Correlated Mutations for Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22526)
*Ofer M. Shir,Michael Emmerich*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该研究为整数进化策略（IESs）奠定基础，提出采用ℓ₁-范数替代ℓ₂-范数，并探索适合无界整数决策变量的突变分布，最终证明双几何分布（DG）优于截断正态分布（TN）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管整数规划（IP）的理论进展显著降低了其复杂性，启发式方法仍是主要求解手段。研究旨在为连续空间设计的随机搜索启发式方法（IESs）提供离散化基础。

Method: 研究采用ℓ₁-范数，探索适合的步长和量化整数格上相关性的方法，重点分析无界整数决策变量的突变分布，比较均匀分布、二项分布、截断正态分布和双几何分布。

Result: 数值模拟表明双几何分布更适合无界整数搜索，且采用相关DG突变的IES在非可分二次整数规划中表现更优。

Conclusion: 理论证明和实践结果表明，用DG替代TN分布是合理的，但更关键的改进是采用ℓ₁-范数而非ℓ₂-范数。

Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the
complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant
problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the
groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized
search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel
in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by
applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while
persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay
foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for
the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify
correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for
unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate
discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which
we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down
to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We
explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose
a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our
investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which
consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for
unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical
evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other
strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the
replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified
and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the
$\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.

Motivation: 解决马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中的Q函数近似问题，为强化学习理论提供数学基础。

Method: 使用带泄漏ReLU激活的DNN近似MDP的支付函数和随机转移动态，并基于MLFP近似方案证明Q函数的L2近似可行性。

Result: 证明了Q函数可以用DNN在L2意义上近似，且参数数量随状态空间维度和误差要求呈多项式增长。

Conclusion: DNN在近似MDP的Q函数方面具有高效性，为强化学习的实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision
processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under
uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying
reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman
equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we
construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated
to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More
specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition
dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified
linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to
\mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can
also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation
whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension
$d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the
prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently
introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation
scheme.

*Alexander Tyurin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文研究了分布式优化中通信时间对性能的影响，证明了在服务器到工作节点的通信时间下，使用无偏稀疏化压缩器无法同时优化服务器端通信时间和方差相关运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化的主要动机是通过增加工作节点数量（n）实现可扩展性，但通信时间（尤其是服务器到工作节点的通信时间）成为瓶颈。

Method: 构建了一个新的“最坏情况”函数，并开发了一个新的下界框架，将分析简化为随机和的集中性。

Result: 证明在服务器到工作节点的通信时间下，无法设计出能同时优化服务器端通信时间和方差相关运行时间的无偏稀疏化压缩器方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了分布式优化在可扩展性方面的基本限制，即使在同质（i.i.d.）假设下也存在瓶颈。

Abstract: We consider centralized distributed optimization in the classical federated
learning setup, where $n$ workers jointly find an $\varepsilon$-stationary
point of an $L$-smooth, $d$-dimensional nonconvex function $f$, having access
only to unbiased stochastic gradients with variance $\sigma^2$. Each worker
requires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the
communication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the
server are $\tau_{s}$ and $\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One
of the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability
with respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed
version of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L
\Delta}{n \varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where
$\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,
using unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the
variance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However,
once we account for the communication from the server to the workers
$\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using
unbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side
communication runtime term $\tau_{s} d \frac{L \Delta}{\varepsilon}$ and the
variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2},$
better than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case,
where all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we
construct a new "worst-case" function and develop a new lower bound framework
that reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we
prove a concentration bound. These results reveal fundamental limitations in
scaling distributed optimization, even under the homogeneous assumption.

Conclusion: CBO是一种有效的黑盒对抗攻击方法，具有理论支持和实际优势。

Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) has established itself as an efficient
gradient-free optimization scheme, with attractive mathematical properties,
such as mean-field convergence results for non-convex loss functions. In this
work, we study CBO in the context of closed-box adversarial attacks, which are
imperceptible input perturbations that aim to fool a classifier, without
accessing its gradient. Our contribution is to establish a connection between
the so-called consensus hopping as introduced by Riedl et al. and natural
evolution strategies (NES) commonly applied in the context of adversarial
attacks and to rigorously relate both methods to gradient-based optimization
schemes. Beyond that, we provide a comprehensive experimental study that shows
that despite the conceptual similarities, CBO can outperform NES and other
evolutionary strategies in certain scenarios.

TL;DR: TriADA是一种新型的三线性算法和异构设备架构，用于高效处理高维张量运算，特别针对稀疏数据，提升计算性能和能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量运算在高性能计算和人工智能中需求巨大，但其高计算和内存需求限制了性能，尤其是稀疏数据场景。

Method: 提出TriADA，包括低秩三线性算法、外积GEMM核、异构分布式3D网络和弹性稀疏外积方法。

Result: TriADA能在线性时间内完成超立方算术复杂度的三线性变换，显著提升性能和能源效率。

Conclusion: TriADA为AI和HPC中的张量运算提供了高效、可扩展且节能的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and
artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors.
However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with
dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation
by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases
energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data,
which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear
Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address
these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel,
low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal
transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode
matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM
kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate
3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully
distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with
a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent
of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids
unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands,
thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability.
TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with
hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The
massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is
ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most
demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large,
centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise
of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers
such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work
together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of
Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for
computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance
metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and
expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application
requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers
and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with
system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT
environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address
evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system
observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting
appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this
critical area.

TL;DR: Libra提出了一种协同利用CUDA和Tensor核心的方法，优化稀疏矩阵乘法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速器单独使用CUDA或Tensor核心时性能不足，需结合两者优势。

Method: 采用2D感知任务分配策略，结合Tensor核心高性能和CUDA核心低冗余计算，并进行异构计算优化。

Result: 在H100和RTX 4090 GPU上，Libra性能优于现有技术，平均提升3.1倍（最高9.23倍）。

Conclusion: Libra通过充分利用GPU异构计算资源，为稀疏算子加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used
in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly
equipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The
former brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix
multiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with
higher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one
resource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication,
due to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a
systematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and
Tensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication.
Specifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out
the sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both
the high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on
CUDA cores. In addition, Libra incorporates systematic optimizations for
heterogeneous computing, including hybrid load-balancing, finely optimized
kernel implementations, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing. Extensive
experimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that Libra outperforms the
state-of-the-art by on average 3.1x (up to 9.23x) over DTC-SpMM and 2.9x (up to
3.9x) for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for
sparse operator acceleration by fully exploiting the heterogeneous computing
resources on GPUs.

Motivation: 随着AI工作负载的快速扩展，水资源消耗成为计算可持续性的关键问题，但现有评估常忽略水资源压力的时空差异。

Method: SCARF框架结合用水量和当地水资源压力的时空变化，计算AWI指标。

Result: 通过三个案例研究（LLM服务、数据中心和半导体制造厂），展示了通过优化地点和时间选择减少用水影响的潜力。

Conclusion: SCARF为水资源可持续计算提供了新方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Water consumption is an increasingly critical dimension of computing
sustainability, especially as AI workloads rapidly scale. However, current
water impact assessment often overlooks where and when water stress is more
severe. To fill in this gap, we present SCARF, the first general framework that
evaluates water impact of computing by factoring in both spatial and temporal
variations in water stress. SCARF calculates an Adjusted Water Impact (AWI)
metric that considers both consumption volume and local water stress over time.
Through three case studies on LLM serving, datacenters, and semiconductor
fabrication plants, we show the hidden opportunities for reducing water impact
by optimizing location and time choices, paving the way for water-sustainable
computing. The code is available at https://github.com/jojacola/SCARF.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI)
with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and
Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges
encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group
services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2
Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate
the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our
performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts
across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find
that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time
for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency
over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple
software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop
optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result,
the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the
state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we
construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying
configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private
LLM systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在边缘设备上实现了高效、低功耗的推理服务。

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to
diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes
more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future
inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an
inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's
computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more
cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an
accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint
model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server
dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and
adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the
device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are
considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference
system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach
optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize
time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of
tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our
knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing
quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by
introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with
computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below
1%.

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices
introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.
Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,
while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing
on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently
manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade
heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces
Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on
memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu
first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model
kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel
annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level
preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC
utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append
proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware
dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves
4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains
1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to
state-of-the-art inference engines.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of
multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor
misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment
methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes,
highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two
complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing
misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements.
First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom
(5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error
of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce
a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera
images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt
errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the
potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像的负载信号融合方法是一种实用且有效的实时防跌倒解决方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在手术室风险检测中视觉-语义知识冲突（VS-KC）的方法，通过生成合成图像数据集OR-VSKC，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全和减少可预防医疗错误至关重要，但现有MLLMs在视觉安全违规检测中存在不足。

Method: 通过扩散模型生成34,000多张合成图像和214张人工标注图像构建OR-VSKC数据集，用于训练和验证MLLMs。

Result: 微调后的MLLMs在训练过的冲突实体检测上表现显著提升，但对未训练实体类型效果不佳。

Conclusion: OR-VSKC数据集和方法为研究VS-KC提供了资源，但需更全面的训练以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决夜间因缺乏可见光而无法进行全天候气象观测的问题，扩展夜间可见光数据的应用。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI多波段热红外数据，开发生成扩散模型RefDiff，实现夜间可见光反射率的高精度检索。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构和厚云区域表现尤为突出，夜间检索能力与白天相当。

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率检索能力，为夜间气象观测提供了新工具。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more

Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，RES方法计算成本高，需结合两者优势。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段为分割感知图像检索，第二阶段用MLLM重排序和对象定位；离线生成对象掩码和区域嵌入。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，检索和分割效果显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和两阶段框架有效结合了TIR和RES，提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

<details>

Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本对数据，且数据模态和标准不统一，阻碍了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练；2) 从9个教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在六类任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法，适用于实际数据限制场景。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学视觉问答中常生成错误答案或检索无关上下文，忽视了多模态信息的重要性。

Method: MOTOR利用基于文本和视觉的检索重排序方法，结合grounded captions和optimal transport技术。

Result: 在MedVQA数据集上，MOTOR平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态上下文检索，显著提升了医学视觉问答的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标签数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的模态差异和单帧LiDAR稀疏性问题，避免依赖多帧累积或额外先验。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中表现优异，优于依赖累积点云的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在单帧LiDAR下实现了高性能，为点像素配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过结合结构化记忆系统和基础模型，提升具身智能体的终身学习和社交能力。

Method: Ella采用多模态记忆系统（语义记忆和情景记忆）与基础模型结合，支持信息存储、更新和检索，实现自主决策和社交互动。

Result: 实验表明，Ella能有效影响、领导和合作其他代理，展示出通过观察和社交学习的强大能力。

Conclusion: 结合结构化记忆与基础模型为具身智能的发展提供了变革性潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

TL;DR: MotionGPT3是一个双模态运动-语言模型，通过分离参数和共享注意力机制解决运动与语言统一建模的挑战，同时保持语言智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在统一理解和生成方面表现出强大能力，但运动-语言统一模型的发展仍不足。需要解决运动模态与离散表示的重建差距以及统一训练中语言智能的退化问题。

Method: 提出MotionGPT3，将运动作为第二模态，通过分离参数和共享注意力机制实现跨模态交互。使用运动VAE编码运动到潜在空间，扩散头预测运动潜在表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动理解和生成任务上表现优异，同时保持语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3建立了自回归框架下的双模态运动扩散统一模型。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于听众增强的GRPO框架，通过重新评估推理链来校准奖励信号，显著提升了模型在人类视觉偏好任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型在泛化性和避免记忆化方面存在不足，需要复杂的标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能改善泛化性，但在推理准确性上仍有缺陷。

Method: 引入听众增强的GRPO框架，听众模型重新评估推理链并提供校准的置信分数，从而优化强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: 在ImageReward基准测试中达到67.4%的准确率，OOD性能提升6%，减少了推理矛盾。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好的对齐提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

Motivation: 扩散模型的高计算成本是主要瓶颈，现有加速技术存在计算误差和生成质量的限制。

Method: 提出MoDiff框架，结合调制量化和误差补偿，兼容现有缓存和量化方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和LSUN上实验表明，MoDiff将激活量化从8位降至3位且性能无损。

Conclusion: MoDiff为扩散模型提供了一种高效、通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Result: 在工业缺陷数据集上验证了方法的优越性，实现了高精度缺陷分割。

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了弱监督学习与高精度缺陷分割之间的鸿沟，为资源受限的工业场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

TL;DR: STR-Match是一种无需训练的视频编辑算法，通过新的STR评分优化潜在空间，解决现有方法的时间不一致性和运动失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动扭曲和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR评分，指导潜在优化，避免昂贵的3D注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上均优于现有方法，尤其在显著领域转换时仍保持性能。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过优化时空像素相关性建模，显著提升了视频编辑的视觉一致性和领域适应性。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Sa2VA）直接将特征融合到分割模型中，导致动态视觉信息与静态语义纠缠，降低分割准确性。

Method: 提出DeSa2VA，包括文本预训练生成点级提示和文本掩码，线性解耦模块分离文本和视觉特征，动态掩码融合策略结合解耦特征。

Result: 在图像分割、图像问答、视频分割和视频问答等任务中表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合显著提升了分割和接地任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D位置数据无法全面捕捉盘带中的关键动态（如平衡和方向），限制了分析的深度。

Method: 从2022/23赛季欧冠的1,736次盘带中提取3D姿态特征，并结合传统2D数据评估其对盘带成功的影响。

Result: 姿态特征（如攻击者平衡和攻防方向对齐）对预测盘带成功具有信息量，结合2D数据可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 3D姿态数据为足球盘带分析提供了新维度，显著优于传统2D方法。

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Result: 提供格式化样本、系统顺序、曲目标元数据，以及未分割的完整乐谱和预处理图像。

Conclusion: VisionScores为机器学习和深度学习任务提供了丰富的结构化乐谱数据资源。

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型日益复杂，解释性差，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅针对样本级别。

Method: 利用CBM框架近似黑盒推理，自动识别并修正有害概念，将修正后的知识蒸馏回原模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

TL;DR: MEMFOF是一种高效的多帧光流估计方法，显著降低GPU内存消耗，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率（如FullHD）输入下光流估计方法GPU内存消耗过高的问题。

Method: 通过优化RAFT-like架构的设计选择，减少相关性体积并采用高分辨率训练协议，结合多帧估计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，内存消耗显著降低（运行时2.09GB，训练时28.5GB）。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在高分辨率光流估计中实现了内存效率和性能的平衡，优于其他资源密集型方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,

Conclusion: CPE通过非线性模块和对抗训练有效擦除目标概念并保护其他概念，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进测试时间提示调优（TPT）的方法，通过利用大语言模型（LLM）的先验知识初始化提示，并提出正则化损失，显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLM）的置信度校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPT方法在提高准确率的同时导致置信度校准下降，限制了其在关键应用中的适用性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 利用LLM的先验知识初始化测试时间提示；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，本文方法（TCA）的平均预期校准误差（ECE）为4.11，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: TCA方法有效解决了TPT的校准问题，为VLM在关键应用中的使用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCA在低分辨率网格上表现良好，但在高分辨率时面临计算、内存和通信限制。论文旨在通过隐式解码器和新型损失函数解决这些问题。

Method: 结合隐式神经表示，使用轻量级解码器在粗网格上运行NCA，并通过独立处理的MLP生成高分辨率输出。

Result: 该方法实现了实时生成全高清输出的能力，同时保持了自组织和涌现特性，并在多种NCA变体和任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过隐式解码器和定制损失函数，NCA能够高效扩展到高分辨率，为纹理合成和形态生成提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

TL;DR: VolumetricSMPL提出了一种基于神经混合权重（NBW）的神经体积人体模型，显著提升了计算效率和表达能力，适用于多种复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于表面网格的人体模型在处理几何实体交互时效率低下，现有体积神经隐式模型在复杂人体姿态下鲁棒性不足或计算成本高。

Method: 利用NBW动态混合少量学习权重矩阵，生成紧凑高效的MLP解码器，结合SDF实现高效可微接触建模。

Result: VolumetricSMPL在推理速度、GPU内存占用和准确性上优于COAP，并在四项任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在性能与效率上均有显著提升，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Abstract: Scene categorization (SC) in remotely acquired images is an important subject
with broad consequences in different fields, including catastrophe control,
ecological observation, architecture for cities, and more. Nevertheless, its
several apps, reaching a high degree of accuracy in SC from distant observation
data has demonstrated to be difficult. This is because traditional conventional
deep learning models require large databases with high variety and high levels

TL;DR: 提出Segment Attribution Tables (SATs)方法，通过汇总局部显著性解释生成半全局洞察，帮助分析图像分类器的依赖模式和虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类中表现优异，但模型预测的解释仍具挑战性。现有方法要么过于局部（如显著性图），要么过于简化全局方法，难以捕捉重要局部行为。

Method: SATs利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图量化其影响，揭示模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性。

Result: SATs能够识别模型依赖的片段（如背景或水印），即使测试性能变化不大，也能揭示潜在问题。

Conclusion: SATs填补了过度简化全局总结与过于详细局部解释之间的空白，为图像分类器的分析和调试提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像超分辨率技术常面临真实感与计算效率的权衡问题，尤其是在减少采样步骤时会导致图像模糊和不真实。

Method: 通过将受控随机性引入训练过程，避免陷入局部最优，并结合Sigmoidal噪声排序方法简化训练，提升推理速度。

Result: 在LPIPS、LOE、PSNR、SSIM等指标上表现优异，边缘重建能力更强，且能自适应学习布朗噪声模式。

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率的真实感和计算效率上取得了显著平衡，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类任务中，现有视觉语言模型无法捕捉时间结构的问题。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成有序子动作序列，并通过动态时间规整（DTW）在共享嵌入空间中对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准测试中达到30.5%的准确率，优于十亿参数视频语言模型，且参数减少8倍。

Conclusion: 结构化语言先验与经典对齐技术结合，为细粒度视频理解提供了一种可扩展的通用方法。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs的解释性不足影响了模型的可信度和可视化效果，现有方法忽视了上下文冗余激活对解释可靠性的干扰。

Method: 提出TAM方法，结合因果推断和高斯滤波，减少上下文冗余激活的干扰，提升解释质量。

Result: TAM在多种场景（如目标定位、失败案例分析等）中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM为MLLMs提供了高质量的解释工具，适用于多种应用场景，提升了模型的可信度和可视化效果。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Conclusion: CDAL通过因果建模和解耦设计，有效提升开放世界模型归因的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Motivation: 现有的INR编码方法速度慢，且加速时往往牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制，限制了其实际应用。

Method: SIEDD采用共享编码器快速捕捉全局低频特征，冻结后并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，SIEDD实现了20-30倍的编码速度提升，同时保持竞争性重建质量和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了高效可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Result: 在TAMP-Street数据集上，InDiTE-Diff方法显著优于现有参考引导的图像修复方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff为解决时间变化图像修复问题提供了有效方案，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Method: 通过物体相对于自动驾驶车辆的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非具体类别。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，从而提升自动驾驶决策的实时性和安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中的决策能力，为安全驾驶提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

TL;DR: VLSR框架通过视觉-语言模型CLIP嵌入图像和文本标签到共享语义空间，利用余弦相似度进行标签清洗和聚类，显著提升工业图像数据集的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业领域的大规模数据集常因众包和网络爬取而存在标签噪声和不一致，高质量标注成本高且耗时，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用CLIP模型嵌入图像和标签到共享语义空间，通过余弦相似度清洗标签，并通过密度聚类合并语义相似的标签。

Result: 在Factorynet数据集上，VLSR成功识别问题标签并提升一致性，显著减少标签词汇量。

Conclusion: VLSR框架以最小人工干预提升数据集质量，适用于工业领域鲁棒机器学习模型的训练。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: Qwen-GUI-3B通过高效训练策略和数据优化，实现了高性能且资源友好的GUI任务解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM)
specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving
performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale
VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for
consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while
being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates
several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B
parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling
and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in
high-resolution desktop scenarios. The Qwen-GUI-3B is available at:

Motivation: CLIP模型在医学图像分类中表现优异，但存在公平性问题，如种族和性别偏见，影响诊断结果的可靠性。

Method: 提出AdFair-CLIP框架，利用对抗性特征干预抑制敏感属性，减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上实验表明，AdFair-CLIP显著提升公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和少样本场景中保持稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型（尤其是胸部X光分析）设定了公平性学习的新基准。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法为自监督模型的测试时适应提供了新思路，展示了无需源预训练的潜力。

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

Conclusion: GVIT通过高斯表示和梯度引导，实现了与传统ViT相当的性能，展示了高效输入表示的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率卫星图像获取受限于传感器的时空限制和高成本，影响环境监测、灾害响应等应用。

Method: 提出MWT-Diff框架，结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换，利用MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，指导扩散过程重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，通过FID和LPIPS等指标验证。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Motivation: 物体检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗性补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有的对抗训练方法主要针对分类模型，对物体检测器的防御研究较少。

Method: 提出PBCAT方法，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局不可察觉对抗扰动，统一防御多种物理可实现攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著提升了模型对多种攻击的鲁棒性，检测准确率比现有防御方法提高了29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT是一种有效的对抗训练策略，能够统一防御多种物理可实现攻击，为物体检测器的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述往往难以获取。

Method: 设计Chain-of-Thoughts提示从MLLMs生成描述，提出原型条件机制增强生成器对新描述组合的鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集上验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过外部知识提升了医学图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

*Chang'an Yi,Xiaohui Deng,Guohao Chen,Yan Zhou,Qinghua Lu,Shuaicheng Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跨模型协同学习框架COCA，用于测试时适应（TTA），通过整合不同模型的互补知识提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨模型知识如何影响TTA过程，发现不同模型可以提供互补的自信知识。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含协同适应和自我适应两种策略，整合互补知识并增强模型独特性。

Result: COCA显著提升了现有方法的性能，例如将ViT-Base在ImageNet-C上的准确率从51.7%提升到64.5%。

Conclusion: COCA是一种有效的跨模型TTA方法，可作为即插即用模块提升多种模型的性能。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示驱动的视觉语言模型（VLM），结合Grounding DINO和SAM2，用于多器官超声图像分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像分割因解剖变异性、成像协议多样性和标注数据有限而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用18个公共超声数据集，15个用于微调Grounding DINO（采用LoRA），3个用于测试未见分布的性能。

Result: 在多数已知数据集上优于现有方法，且在未见数据集上表现良好，无需额外微调。

Conclusion: VLM在超声图像分析中具有潜力，减少了对大规模器官特定标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for
Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks
shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to

TL;DR: IT-Blender是一种基于T2I扩散适配器的方法，用于自动化视觉与文本概念的混合，以增强人类创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中存在认知偏差（如设计固定），导致设计空间陷入局部最优。IT-Blender旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和噪声生成图像的潜在表示，并结合新型混合注意力机制。

Result: IT-Blender在视觉与文本概念混合任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FADRM的新方法，首次引入数据残差匹配概念，通过数据级跳跃连接优化数据生成和信息保留，显著提升数据集蒸馏任务的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索残差连接在数据为中心的方法中的潜力，解决数据信息消失问题，平衡新知识与原始数据核心信息。

Method: 提出数据残差匹配（Data Residual Matching），结合像素空间优化和核心局部信息识别，并引入优化级改进以提升计算效率。

Result: 在多个数据集基准测试中表现优异，计算效率提升50%，测试准确率显著超越现有方法（如单模型47.7%，多模型50.0%）。

Conclusion: FADRM方法在数据集蒸馏任务中实现了高效和性能的双重突破，成为新的state-of-the-art。

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4%
and +4.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/Jiacheng8/FADRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨后验漂移对预测模型的影响，特别是在可能发生制度变化的场景（如金融市场）中。

Method: 分析数据生成过程载荷在训练和测试样本间的变化，应用于股票溢价预测，研究市场择时策略的敏感性。

Result: 小带宽参数导致回报异质性高，大带宽参数结果更一致但风险调整后回报较低。

Conclusion: 建议谨慎使用大型线性模型进行股市预测。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample
forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document
the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change
between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in
which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets.
Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of
a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that
control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that
focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous
returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more
consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return
standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when
resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.

*Daniel Ciganda,Ignacio Campón,Iñaki Permanyer,Jakob H Macke*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架和神经后验估计的方法，从年龄别生育率（ASFRs）和计划与非计划生育的年龄分布中推断出生育行为的微观机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年龄别生育率（ASFRs）虽然提供了生育变化的广泛记录，但其聚合性质掩盖了驱动生育趋势的微观行为机制。

Method: 开发了一个无似然贝叶斯框架，结合个体层面的生育过程模型和序列神经后验估计（SNPE），从两个聚合序列中推断出八个行为和生物学参数。

Result: 该方法成功复制了观察到的生育模式，并预测了样本外的微观行为分布（如首次性行为年龄、生育间隔和理想家庭规模）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成完整的合成生命史，支持行为明确的人口预测和构建人口数字孪生。

Abstract: While age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) provide the most extensive record
of reproductive change, their aggregate nature masks the underlying behavioral
mechanisms that ultimately drive fertility trends. To recover these mechanisms,
we develop a likelihood-free Bayesian framework that couples an
individual-level model of the reproductive process with Sequential Neural
Posterior Estimation (SNPE). This allows us to infer eight behavioral and
biological parameters from just two aggregate series: ASFRs and the age-profile
of planned versus unplanned births. Applied to U.S. National Survey of Family
Growth cohorts and to Demographic and Health Survey cohorts from Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, and Peru, the method reproduces observed fertility
schedules and, critically, predicts out-of-sample micro-level distributions of
age at first sex, inter-birth intervals, and family-size ideals, none of which
inform the estimation step. Because the fitted model yields complete synthetic
life histories, it enables behaviorally explicit population forecasts and
supports the construction of demographic digital twins.

addressing critical bottlenecks across sensing, network, and application layers
in Cyber-Physical-Social Thinking (CPST) ecosystems. In this survey, we provide
a systematic and comprehensive review of AGI-enhanced IoX research, focusing on
three key components: sensing-layer data management, network-layer protocol
optimization, and application-layer decision-making frameworks. Specifically,
this survey explores how AGI can mitigate IoX bottlenecks challenges by
leveraging adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and selective attention
mechanisms at the sensing layer, while resolving network-layer issues such as
protocol heterogeneity and dynamic spectrum management, neuro-symbolic
reasoning, active inference, and causal reasoning, Furthermore, the survey
examines AGI-enabled frameworks for managing identity and relationship
explosion. Key findings suggest that AGI-driven strategies, such as adaptive
sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and semantic modeling, offer novel solutions
to sensing-layer data overload, network-layer protocol heterogeneity, and
application-layer identity explosion. The survey underscores the importance of
cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and ethical governance
frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX systems. Finally, the survey identifies
unresolved challenges, such as computational requirements, scalability, and
real-world validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI's
potential in addressing IoX bottlenecks. we believe AGI-enhanced IoX is
emerging as a critical research field at the intersection of interconnected

Conclusion: 离线RL方法不仅性能更优，还能通过同一数据集训练不同目标函数，提供比基于规则方法更高的操作灵活性。

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm
and study the possibility of learning the optimal Cell Individual Offset tuning
using offline Reinforcement Learning. Such methods make use of collected
offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We
adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as
a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy
for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input
features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used.
Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on
a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable
cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up
to 7% improvement. Furthermore, offline-RL can be trained for diverse objective
functions using the same available dataset, thus offering operational
flexibility compared to rule-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户对计算密集型服务的需求增加，云计算的延迟问题凸显，多接入边缘计算（MEC）通过将计算资源靠近用户来缓解这一问题。然而，有限的边缘容量和动态网络条件使得服务部署决策具有挑战性。

Method: 将服务需求建模为服务属性的线性函数，并将服务部署任务建模为线性多臂老虎机问题。提出了一种分布式自适应多智能体最佳臂识别（BAI）算法，小基站作为智能体协作加速学习。

Result: 仿真表明，该算法能以所需置信度识别最优服务，并实现接近最优的加速效果，学习轮次随小基站数量成比例减少。

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了边缘计算服务部署的优化问题，理论分析验证了其样本复杂性和通信开销的合理性。

Abstract: As users in small cell networks increasingly rely on computation-intensive
services, cloud-based access often results in high latency. Multi-access edge
computing (MEC) mitigates this by bringing computational resources closer to
end users, with small base stations (SBSs) serving as edge servers to enable
low-latency service delivery. However, limited edge capacity makes it
challenging to decide which services to deploy locally versus in the cloud,
especially under unknown service demand and dynamic network conditions. To
tackle this problem, we model service demand as a linear function of service
attributes and formulate the service placement task as a linear bandit problem,
where SBSs act as agents and services as arms. The goal is to identify the
service that, when placed at the edge, offers the greatest reduction in total
user delay compared to cloud deployment. We propose a distributed and adaptive
multi-agent best-arm identification (BAI) algorithm under a fixed-confidence
setting, where SBSs collaborate to accelerate learning. Simulations show that
our algorithm identifies the optimal service with the desired confidence and
achieves near-optimal speedup, as the number of learning rounds decreases
proportionally with the number of SBSs. We also provide theoretical analysis of
the algorithm's sample complexity and communication overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的流量工程方案无法适应拓扑变化或计算和内存开销过大，Geminet旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Geminet通过解耦神经网络与拓扑，学习基于梯度下降的迭代调整过程，并将优化从路径级路由权重转移到边级对偶变量以减少内存消耗。

Result: Geminet在WAN和数据中心数据集上表现优异，神经网络大小仅为现有方案的0.04%至7%，内存消耗低于10 GiB，收敛速度比HARP快5.45倍。

Conclusion: Geminet展示了在大规模部署中的潜力，解决了现有方案的不足。

Abstract: Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE),
leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by
optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they
either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to
excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can
handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a
methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an
iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of
gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related
quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to
edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact
that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center
datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural
network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology
variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,
without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies,
Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the
80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence
speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络数据遵循多种规则，但手动或仅依赖机器学习提取规则存在不完整和不可靠的问题。NetNomos旨在通过约束建模解决这一问题。

Method: NetNomos采用基于格结构的搜索方法，通过约束的特异性和简洁性降低学习复杂度，从超二次复杂度降至对数复杂度。

Result: NetNomos在多种网络数据集上能学习所有基准规则（包括仅占0.01%数据点的规则），且运行时间少于三小时，而基线方法仅发现不到25%的规则且耗时数天。

Conclusion: NetNomos在合成流量生成评估、异常检测和遥测插补方面展示了实用性，为网络监控和数据分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols,
design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay
must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic
constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the
brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic
understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of
reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches
yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.
  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and
introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from
raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely
challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and
passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos
addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint
specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from
superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial
search space.
  Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all
benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data
points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than
25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies,
we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven
synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their
generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be
used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for
telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

*Difeng Cai,Paulina Sepúlveda*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督学习的框架，用于在数据驱动设置中检测函数奇点，解决了未知奇点位置的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数奇点会显著影响数值计算的效率，尤其是在奇点位置未知的情况下，因此需要一种有效的方法来检测奇点。

Method: 采用自监督学习框架，通过预处理任务（基于k近邻和核密度估计的过滤方法）来估计奇点位置。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够处理输入扰动、标签污染以及不同类型的奇点（如内部圆、边界层等）。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习框架在数据驱动设置中有效检测奇点，为数值计算提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a
fundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine
the effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical
integration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc.
The problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is
unknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity
is therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce
computational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider
singularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only
contains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the
limitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning
(SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component
is a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering
methods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density
estimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the
potential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without
filtering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the
proposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and
different kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer,
concentric semicircles, etc.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: TEDI是一种无需离散化的算法，用于学习真实且效用最大化的机制，解决了现有方法因离散化导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖结果空间的离散化以确保真实性，但随着问题规模增大效率降低。

Method: 提出基于定价规则的新菜单机制，使用Partial GroupMax Network参数化定价规则，并开发了新的训练技术。

Result: 理论分析证明TEDI具有真实性、完全表达性和维度不敏感性，实验显示其性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: TEDI是首个无需结果离散化的真实机制学习方法，为自动化机制设计和可微分经济学提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive
approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and
utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on
discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to
inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we
formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes
to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can
be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The
core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial
GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally
approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we
develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous
sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order
optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees
truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental
evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves
strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without
outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed
concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential
value and provide new insights for automated mechanism design and
differentiable economics.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: P4OMP是一个基于检索增强的框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）将串行C/C++代码转换为OpenMP并行代码，无需模型微调或编译器插桩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在生成OpenMP并行代码时的正确性问题，提高代码生成的可靠性。

Method: 结合检索增强生成（RAG）和OpenMP教程的结构化知识，通过检索上下文改进提示驱动的代码生成。

Result: 在108个真实C++程序测试中，P4OMP实现100%编译成功率，而基线方法在20个案例中失败。

Conclusion: P4OMP显著提高了LLM生成的OpenMP代码的可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: We present P4OMP, a retrieval-augmented framework for transforming serial
C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code using large language models
(LLMs). To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based
prompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler
instrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the
reliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the
retrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline
prompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,
GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world
C++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.
P4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the
baseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on
non-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to
fundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP
consistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive
combinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code. We further
demonstrate strong runtime scaling across seven compute-intensive benchmarks on
an HPC cluster. P4OMP offers a robust, modular pipeline that significantly
improves the reliability and applicability of LLM-generated OpenMP code.

Motivation: LLM在软件开发中常生成不完整或错误的代码，尤其是缺乏外部或项目特定文档时。

Result: 在78个真实Java导入错误案例中，RAILS优于基线提示，保持意图并避免幻觉。

Conclusion: RAILS展示了检索增强方法的潜力，未来将扩展支持更多语言和IDE。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo are increasingly used to
assist software development, yet they often produce incomplete code or
incorrect imports, especially when lacking access to external or
project-specific documentation. We introduce RAILS (Retrieval-Augmented
Intelligence for Learning Software Development), a framework that augments LLM
prompts with semantically retrieved context from curated Java resources using
FAISS and OpenAI embeddings. RAILS incorporates an iterative validation loop
guided by compiler feedback to refine suggestions. We evaluated RAILS on 78
real-world Java import error cases spanning standard libraries, GUI APIs,
external tools, and custom utilities. Despite using the same LLM, RAILS
outperforms baseline prompting by preserving intent, avoiding hallucinations,
and surfacing correct imports even when libraries are unavailable locally.
Future work will integrate symbolic filtering via PostgreSQL and extend support
to other languages and IDEs.

TL;DR: 量化对大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成任务中的鲁棒性影响首次被系统研究，结果显示量化模型比全精度模型更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化虽广泛用于压缩LLMs，但其对模型鲁棒性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过对抗攻击输入提示和模型架构噪声扰动，评估四种LLM家族的量化效果。

Result: 量化LLMs在51.59%的对抗实验中表现更优，且能承受更高权重扰动。

Conclusion: 量化不仅降低计算需求，还能提升LLMs在代码生成中的可靠性。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large
Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference
without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses
on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original
counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this
paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization
affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive
experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and
StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate
robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and
noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional
wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness
compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our
adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,
our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation
generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest
that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually
enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights
for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CoT、ICL和LLM的新方法，用于从软件文档中提取隐私行为并生成隐私需求，结果显示主流LLM表现优异且可通过调参优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐私需求常被视为安全概念或事后考虑，导致合规问题和隐私侵犯，现有方法多关注法规合规性，缺乏从开发早期提取隐私行为的能力。

Method: 结合链式思维提示（CoT）、上下文学习（ICL）和大语言模型（LLM），从软件文档中提取隐私行为并生成用户故事形式的隐私需求。

Result: 主流LLM（如GPT-4o和Llama 3）在隐私行为识别和需求生成上F1分数超过0.8，且通过参数调优可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为利用和优化LLM在软件开发全周期中生成隐私需求提供了新思路。

Abstract: Research shows that analysts and developers consider privacy as a security
concept or as an afterthought, which may lead to non-compliance and violation
of users' privacy. Most current approaches, however, focus on extracting legal
requirements from the regulations and evaluating the compliance of software and
processes with them. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on
chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), in-context-learning (ICL), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) to extract privacy behaviors from various software documents
prior to and during software development, and then generate privacy
requirements in the format of user stories. Our results show that most commonly
used LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama 3, can identify privacy behaviors and
generate privacy user stories with F1 scores exceeding 0.8. We also show that
the performance of these models could be improved through parameter-tuning. Our
findings provide insight into using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy
requirements given software documents created prior to or throughout the
software development lifecycle.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined
artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and
enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However,
LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle,
yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions

we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development
lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset
construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation,
deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by
identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research
directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable
insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM
development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STCLocker的技术，用于测试多自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的协作性能，特别是避免死锁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术主要关注单AV测试，而多AV交通中的协作性能（如死锁）研究不足。

Method: STCLocker包含三个关键组件：死锁检测器（Deadlock Oracle）、冲突反馈（Conflict Feedback）和冲突感知场景生成（Conflict-aware Scenario Generation），用于生成死锁场景（DLSs）。

Result: 实验表明，STCLocker在生成DLSs方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: STCLocker填补了多AV协作性能测试的空白，为自动驾驶系统的安全性和可靠性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing
techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV
settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes
crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding
deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了机器学习天气预测（MLWP）对初始条件误差的敏感性，提出了一种名为Arnoldi-SV（A-SV）的方法，无需线性或伴随模型版本，适用于数值天气预报（NWP）和MLWP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于天气预报本质上是存在不确定性的，可靠的决策需要未来天气情景的概率信息。研究旨在探索MLWP对初始条件误差的敏感性。

Method: 使用A-SV方法，通过对初始条件施加特定类型的奇异向量（SV）扰动，观察误差增长。该方法通过迭代应用预报模型生成Krylov子空间，近似局部误差增长。

Result: A-SV成功为24小时Pangu Weather模型找到了动态有意义的扰动模式，这些扰动描述了局部不稳定模式，可用于初始化MLWP集合。

Conclusion: A-SV方法能够将随机噪声转化为基于参考状态的扰动，类似于GenCast的去噪过程，为MLWP集合初始化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making
requires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore
the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h
Pangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a
specific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)
method does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to
numerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth
within a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast
model to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly
based on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each
iteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are
expected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed
finds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather
model, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These
perturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize
MLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the
algorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference
state - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic
diffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities
and differences.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for
future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network
optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook
crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on
offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless
dynamics and non-stationary environments. Furthermore, these models often lack
the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a
fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving
from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges
faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system
structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in
next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research
directions for realizing adaptive, robust, and autonomous wireless systems.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个可扩展的框架，揭示了语义相似性在科学奖励动态中的作用，并提出了新问题。

Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon
established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether
this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a
scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To
operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary
metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic
neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed
number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those
papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as
the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.
We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its
subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,
surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five
different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on
citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors
consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.
These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific
literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.
Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model
predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for
linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new
questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the
dynamics of scientific reward.

Abstract: Persistence is often regarded as a virtue in science. In this paper, however,
we challenge this conventional view by highlighting its contextual nature,
particularly how persistence can become a liability during periods of paradigm
shift. We focus on the deep learning revolution catalyzed by AlexNet in 2012.
Analyzing the 20-year career trajectories of over 5,000 scientists who were
active in top machine learning venues during the preceding decade, we examine
how their research focus and output evolved. We first uncover a dynamic period
in which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning
developments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning
methods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways.
Those who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more
slowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace
new directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by
citation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic
adaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak
connections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together,
our macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as
mechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）显著提升开源软件开发者的生产力、知识共享和技能获取，效果因开发者经验水平而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对开源软件开发的影响，特别是在代码开发、知识共享和技能发展方面的作用。

Method: 利用意大利临时禁止ChatGPT的自然实验，采用双重差分法和双向固定效应分析GitHub上88,022名开发者的数据。

Result: ChatGPT使开发者生产力提升6.4%，知识共享提升9.6%，技能获取提升8.4%，效果因经验水平不同而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在提升开发者生产力、知识共享和技能获取方面具有显著效果，需根据开发者经验水平战略部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software
development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand
this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence
OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill
development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work
in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary
ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with
two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in
three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We
find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge
sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary
significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience
productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from
improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we
find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest
benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving
contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct

Abstract: Large language models are thought to have potential to aid in medical
decision making. We investigate this here. We start with the treatment problem,
the patient's core medical decision-making task, which is solved in
collaboration with a healthcare provider. We discuss approaches to solving the
treatment problem, including -- within evidence-based medicine -- trials and
observational data. We then discuss the chat problem, and how this differs from
the treatment problem -- in particular as it relates to imitation. We then
discuss how a large language model might be used to solve the treatment problem
and highlight some of the challenges that emerge. We finally discuss how these
challenges relate to evidence-based medicine, and how this might inform next
steps.

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states
(MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a
multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the
MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network
quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial
time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the
distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the
rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by
taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible
applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which
the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental
observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material
science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the
primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does
not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which
prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here
we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving
the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model
parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool
to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data
does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush
model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence
of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high
impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of
compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine
learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical
parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact
experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model
parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and
physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the
robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned
approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of
out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby
promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from
experimental radiographic images.

Motivation: 传统自主数据库平台功能有限，仍需人工干预，GaussMaster旨在通过LLM技术实现全面自动化维护。

Method: 采用Tree-of-thought方法分析指标和日志，自动识别问题根源并调用工具解决。

Result: 在银行业实现了34种数据库维护场景的零人工干预。

Conclusion: GaussMaster显著提升了数据库维护效率，展示了LLM在数据库管理中的潜力。

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs
shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment,
diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and
customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an
effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous
database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing
single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual
intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.
GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based
database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to
assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide
comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit
abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire
maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of
metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,
and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully
implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,
where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance
scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks
with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.

Result: 在两个数据集上超越八种先进方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FedCLAM在医学分割任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统心血管磁共振（CMR）在儿科和先天性心脏病中使用2D呼吸门控电影成像和3D静态成像，但存在局限性。本研究旨在通过深度学习将2D自由呼吸实时电影图像拼接为3D电影数据集，以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 训练了四种深度学习模型，分别用于对比度校正、呼吸运动校正、超分辨率和心脏结构分割。在10名患者中验证了该方法，并与传统成像进行了比较。

Result: 所有实时数据均成功转换为3D电影，处理时间小于1分钟。心室体积和血管直径与传统成像具有良好一致性，但右肺动脉直径略有高估。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从2D实时电影图像生成3D电影数据的潜力，具有快速采集和重建的优势，有望显著提升临床CMR效率。

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2在解决多器官分割问题上表现出色，尤其是细节和空间信息处理方面。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: CA-Diff通过整合解剖学特征，显著提升了脑MRI分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟染色提供了高效且可控的解决方案，代码将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Method: 使用两种类特定的深度卷积生成对抗网络（DCGAN）生成合成图像，并在联邦学习框架（FedAvg和FedProx）中结合真实数据训练。

Result: 实验表明，适量合成图像将FedAvg的AUC从0.9206提升至0.9237，FedProx的AUC从0.9429提升至0.9538。

Conclusion: 生成AI数据增强能有效提升联邦学习性能，但需平衡合成与真实数据的比例。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach
for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state
quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our
method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a
pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize
the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously
enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and
(2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo
brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed
sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better
preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for
solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Result: 使用Open Kidney Dataset和开源分割模型评估了实时性和准确性，并提供了开源GitHub管道，支持无线流传输和广泛设备兼容性。

Conclusion: 该技术提升了超声培训和诊断效率，尤其在即时医疗场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

### [377] [Lower bounds for trace estimation via Block Krylov and other methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22701)
*Shi Jie Yu*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文研究了估计矩阵函数迹的理论下界，重点关注结合Hutchinson方法和Block Krylov技术的方法。通过分析多项式近似，推导了$A^{-1/2}$和$A^{-1}$等函数的Krylov步数上界，并针对Wishart矩阵的$	ext{tr}(W^{-p})$提出了查询次数的下限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索矩阵函数迹估计的理论界限，特别是结合Block Krylov方法的多项式近似效果，以优化计算成本。

Method: 使用Hutchinson方法和Block Krylov技术，通过多项式近似分析矩阵-向量乘积的近似效果。

Result: 推导了特定函数（如$A^{-1/2}$和$A^{-1}$）的Krylov步数上界，并提出了Wishart矩阵$	ext{tr}(W^{-p})$的查询次数下限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Block Krylov方法步数与多项式近似阶数的关系，将迹估计的总成本与多项式近似的基本限制联系起来。

Abstract: This paper studies theoretical lower bounds for estimating the trace of a
matrix function, $\text{tr}(f(A))$, focusing on methods that use Hutchinson's
method along with Block Krylov techniques. These methods work by approximating
matrix-vector products like $f(A)V$ using a Block Krylov subspace. This is
closely related to approximating functions with polynomials. We derive
theoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such
as $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial
approximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower
limits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for
$\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the
connection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree
of the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace
estimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information
is needed for the computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非可分离AMP算法的普适性，填补现有理论在非高斯数据下的空白。

Method: 提出BCP条件，分析多项式非线性AMP算法，并扩展到Lipschitz非线性算法。

Result: 证明了BCP条件可实现状态演化的普适性，适用于多种常见非线性函数。

Conclusion: 非可分离AMP算法在BCP条件下具有普适性，扩展了现有理论的应用范围。

Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including
Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent,
and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning
dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities
have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy
a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution.
However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have
largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP
algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial
non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their
representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for
matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of
BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal
guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable
non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral
denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with
generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP
algorithms employing these non-linearities.

<details>

Motivation: 研究ATE分布及其混合分布在采样和身份测试中的复杂性，以扩展现有理论并解决Blanca等人提出的开放性问题。

Method: 1. 使用基于数据的初始化方法，证明Glauber动力学在满足修正对数Sobolev不等式的混合分布中快速混合；2. 在坐标条件采样模型中，设计高效的混合ATE分布身份测试算法。

Result: 1. 实现了Glauber动力学的快速混合和最优样本复杂度；2. 解决了Blanca等人的开放性问题，改进了其原始算法。

Conclusion: 论文为ATE分布及其混合分布提供了高效的采样和测试方法，扩展了现有理论，并解决了开放性问题。

Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the
underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate
tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain
of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a
small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified
log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution
requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to
the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and
Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures
of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of
identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the
following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization,
with optimal sample complexity, for mixtures of distributions satisfying
modified log-Sobolev inequalities. This extends work of Huang, Koehler, Lee,
Mohanty, Rajaraman, Vuong, and Wu (STOC 2025, COLT 2025) for mixtures of
distributions satisfying Poincar\'e inequalities.
  2. Answering an open question posed by Blanca et al., we give efficient
identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the
coordinate-conditional sampling access model. We also give some simplifications
and improvements to the original algorithm of Blanca et al.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在高度竞争条件下自上而下注意力对神经信号的影响，填补了现有研究仅关注低竞争条件的空白。

Method: 通过实验观察在共享感受野中两个对立调节目标的刺激下，神经信号的变化。

Result: 在刺激出现100毫秒内，自上而下的注意力非选择性地抑制了任务相关和不相关的神经信号。

Conclusion: 自上而下的注意力在高度竞争条件下通过非选择性抑制来减少无关刺激的影响。

Abstract: It is known that when multiple stimuli are present, top-down attention
selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant
stimuli, but this has been tested only under conditions of minimal competition
of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli
in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down
attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within
100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional
resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant
stimuli.

Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and
generate information. These fixed points can be captured by the Boltzmann-Gibbs
measure, which leads to neural Langevin dynamics that can be used for sampling
and learning a real dataset. We call this type of generative model neural
Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of
distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived
as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore,
one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network,
mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin
machine may be another promising generative model, at least in its strength in

TL;DR: 论文指出单细胞扰动响应模型的性能常被简单预测数据集均值超越，原因是控制参考差异和未加权误差指标导致模式崩溃。作者提出DEG感知指标和加权误差方法，改进评估并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单细胞扰动响应模型的评估方法存在缺陷，导致模式崩溃和虚假的高性能表现，需要改进评估指标以更准确反映生物信号。

Method: 提出DEG感知指标（WMSE和加权Delta R²），并通过大规模模拟和真实数据集验证其有效性。同时引入正负性能基线校准指标。

Result: 改进后的指标使均值基线表现降至无效水平，而真实预测模型得到正确奖励。使用WMSE作为损失函数减少了模式崩溃并提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入加权误差指标和校准基线，论文解决了现有评估方法的缺陷，提升了单细胞扰动响应模型的评估和性能。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response
are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this
anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error
metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological
signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of
two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not
genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We
introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted
mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with
respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high
sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines
to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to
null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we
show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves
model performance.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法主要关注几何和外观建模，缺乏深度场景理解且训练成本高，VoteSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用SAM进行实例分割和2D投票图生成，嵌入空间偏移向量到高斯基元中，结合深度失真约束优化深度定位。

Result: 实验证明VoteSplat在开放词汇3D实例定位、3D点云理解、点击式3D对象定位等方面有效。

Conclusion: VoteSplat通过结合Hough投票与3DGS，实现了高效的3D场景理解，降低了训练成本，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

Motivation: 现有的无分类器指导（CFG）机制在生成过程中对指导尺度的选择敏感，影响图像质量和提示对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了图像质量和提示对齐，且无需额外计算资源。

Conclusion: 提出的调度器改进了提示对齐和图像质量之间的权衡，可无缝替代现有CFG机制。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Motivation: 传统风险评估方法仅依赖超额回报的标准差，无法区分上行和下行风险，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 采用TinyBERT编码器处理长文档，结合动态注意力词云机制和三元组损失进行分类。

Result: 在2013-2024年的数据集上，TinyXRA实现了最先进的预测准确性，并提供透明的风险评估。

Conclusion: TinyXRA在轻量化和解释性方面表现优异，但仍存在局限性，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing
critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable
Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model
that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work
that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for
the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and
downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio
for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to
efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic,
attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization
while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable
deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing
capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for
production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet
loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches
in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk
differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across
seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent
and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively
by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and
qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with
findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了资源分配问题，为6G系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising
potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a
promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.
Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable
and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup
presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which
complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from
single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI
techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,
including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo
recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure
the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based
on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches
that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and
imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and
preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against
traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in
terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our
suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate
extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the
first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using
dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully
non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating
vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life
has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these
estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data
used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory
environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are
assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of
researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made
during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111
participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the
fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times
worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep
learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising
solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for
estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error
in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that
regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and
RR.

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies
worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data,
computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We
develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories
using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes
processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach
integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and
automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations.
Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from
1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation
data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations
demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation
decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building
infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated
industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant
systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.
This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data
analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network
where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this
context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data
analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low
resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data
retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office
by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research
motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables
that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for
energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of
hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables
with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were
performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed
the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental
variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed
methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak
correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自监督学习方法，通过时间-频率感知滤波器和多粒度原型重建，减轻ECG分析中的简单性偏差（SB），并在大规模数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG诊断中动态特征的捕捉常因简单性偏差（SB）而受限，导致模型忽视细微但关键的临床线索。自监督学习（SSL）被发现能缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出时间-频率感知滤波器捕捉ECG信号的动态特征，并结合多粒度原型重建进行粗粒度和细粒度表示学习。

Result: 在六个ECG数据集上的三个下游任务中，该方法显著减轻了SB并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习是解决ECG分析中简单性偏差的有效途径，提出的方法在性能和泛化能力上表现优异。

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic
characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform
deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised
ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking
fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity
Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but
informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence
of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while
simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate
it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL
paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)
Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features
reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,
Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation
learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG
analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million
recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream
tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces
SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released
publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非线性动力学和熵的定量框架，用于在DBS手术中区分STN内外的神经活动，提高了定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DBS手术中STN的定位依赖主观信号特征解释，缺乏客观定量方法。

Method: 利用MER数据，提取非线性动力学和熵特征，训练多种分类器进行交叉验证。

Result: 结合熵和非线性特征的Extra Trees分类器表现最佳（F1=0.902，ROC AUC=0.887），测试集验证泛化能力强（F1=0.922，ROC AUC=0.941）。

Conclusion: 非线性与熵特征可支持DBS手术中的实时数据驱动决策。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with
Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich
electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current
localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal
features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages
nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity
recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were
preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and
labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence
quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from
each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination
of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by
statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features
yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier
emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and
ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed
robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the
potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time,
data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

TL;DR: EEG深度学习应用中，归一化策略的选择对监督学习和自监督学习任务的效果有显著差异，需根据任务类型定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究归一化策略在EEG深度学习中的重要性，特别是在大规模预训练范式（如自监督学习）下，探索最优的归一化方法。

Method: 系统评估归一化粒度（记录级与窗口级）和范围（跨通道与通道内）对监督任务（年龄和性别预测）和自监督任务（对比预测编码）的影响。

Result: 监督任务中，窗口级通道内归一化效果最佳；自监督任务中，窗口级跨通道或最小归一化更有效。

Conclusion: 归一化策略需根据任务类型定制，无通用方案，为EEG深度学习管道的开发提供实用指导。

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the
preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of
large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)
introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from
supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new
questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity
(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on
both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive
Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836
subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal
normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.
Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in
supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window
level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of
task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a
universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our
findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning
pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

Motivation: 现有sEMG运动估计方法依赖难以校准的特定主体肌肉骨骼模型或缺乏生理一致性的纯数据驱动模型，PENN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PENN结合可解释的肌肉骨骼前向动力学与数据驱动的残差学习，采用递归时间结构和轻量卷积神经网络进行残差修正，并设计了两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在六名健康受试者上的实验表明，PENN在RMSE和R²指标上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PENN在保持生理一致性的同时实现了高精度的运动估计，为康复机器人和辅助技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography
(sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in
rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing
sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific
musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely
data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a
novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK
forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving
physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN
employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a
lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to
robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is
designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that
PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square
error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的基础模型，用于跨程序技能评估，通过自监督学习在fNIRS信号上训练，具有高准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为任务特定，依赖复杂预处理，且对新任务或条件缺乏鲁棒性，需开发更通用的技能评估模型。

Method: 使用自监督学习在fNIRS信号上预训练Transformer模型，结合轻量级适配模块和通道注意力机制，实现跨任务评估。

Result: 模型在多个任务上分类准确率超过88%，MCC达0.91以上，且在新任务上仅需少量样本即可达到87%的AUC。

Conclusion: 该模型为高风险的跨程序技能评估提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，适用于动态认知状态分析。

Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires
models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also
generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior
work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are
often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to
new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable
transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals
for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised
learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation
(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all
tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It
generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer
than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter
module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a
novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that
identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through
ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases
and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into
dynamic cognitive states.

Result: 在未见受试者上实现零样本预测，并在跨受试者步态解码中表现优异，同时具备无监督相位检测能力。

Conclusion: 关系域学习为BCI的规模化、无目标部署提供了潜力。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for
advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent
recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal,
phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject
variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a
domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured
contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The
proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic
alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait
reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and
maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization,
during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns
session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on
inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction
for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior
performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally,
it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase
supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of
relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of
BCIs.

Motivation: 设计一种低复杂度、高性能的目标方向值融合方法，减少对先验知识的依赖，适用于未来6G无线网络中的大规模H$^2$AD结构。

Method: 提出CRLB-ratio-WF方法，通过天线数倒数近似各子阵列的逆CRLB，避免实时CRLB计算；构建MBDNN，利用多子阵列的候选角度增强DOA感知。

Result: CRLB-ratio-WF方法性能接近基于CRLB的方法，且显著减少对先验知识的依赖；MBDNN在低信噪比（SNR=-15dB）下估计精度提升一个数量级。

Conclusion: CRLB-ratio-WF和MBDNN方法为6G无线网络中的目标方向值融合提供了高效解决方案，尤其在低信噪比环境下表现优异。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential
technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a
challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of
target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of
prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse
CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time
CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while
preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network
(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by
leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific
branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively
eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that
the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable
to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior
knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR
ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in
estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Conclusion: 该工作为将现代机器学习技术应用于雷达波形设计奠定了数学和计算基础，连接了经典雷达信号处理与自动微分框架。

Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design,
characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its
traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing
integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine
learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical
framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity
functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that
have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation:
proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient
computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout
cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable
operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity
Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain
mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire
pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose
differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic
differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural
network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end
optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with
modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and
demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This
work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying
modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical
radar signal processing with automatic differentiation frameworks.

Result: HMM在实时和非实时场景下均显著提升了AAD算法的性能，优于现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、易于使用，适用于实时和离线场景，为AAD的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as
electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing
on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can
identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are
often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD
with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of
attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much
less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any
moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD
algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We
further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in
both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as
window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall
performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use
and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

Conclusion: 双时间尺度架构和两种优化框架为信息物理系统的控制提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture
for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$
independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating
at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative
reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a
faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the
COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an
infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller
optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure,
where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First,
the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these
frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two
frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two
optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such
that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage
and urban office like environments in real-time.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT

emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as

To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared

Result: 实验表明SAD-RL能高效实现安全行为，消融研究证实分层学习和场景多样性是关键。

Conclusion: SAD-RL为复杂自动驾驶任务提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly

experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: MGPRL适用于资源有限的设备，无需预校准，且开源为ROS包。

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Result: 在对比评估中，该系统表现出更高的效率和效果。

Conclusion: 该系统有望显著提升复杂现实场景中的机器人护送服务。

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: PAC Bench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在物理属性、功能性和约束理解上的基准测试，揭示了当前模型在物理基础理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在机器人操作任务中广泛应用，但其对低层物理前提的理解能力尚未得到验证，这可能影响任务的可靠性。

Method: 通过PAC Bench基准测试，包含多样化的数据集（30,000+标注，673张真实图像，100个人形视角场景，120个模拟约束场景），系统评估VLMs的物理理解能力。

Result: 当前VLMs在基本物理概念理解上存在显著不足，限制了其在可靠机器人操作中的应用。

Conclusion: PAC Bench为评估和改进VLMs的物理推理能力提供了标准化工具，有助于开发更鲁棒的机器人应用模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自动驾驶方法大多忽视策略结构设计，导致驾驶行为波动或无法统一优化驾驶行为与控制。

Method: 采用分层策略结构，高层策略生成长时间尺度运动指导，低层策略生成短时间尺度控制指令，并设计分层安全机制。

Result: 在模拟器和HighD数据集的高速公路多车道场景中，显著提升了自动驾驶性能。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度分层强化学习方法有效解决了驾驶行为波动和统一优化问题，提高了驾驶效率和安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决模仿学习中本体感觉偏移问题的方法，通过领域适应框架和Wasserstein距离优化训练与部署分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习中直接使用所有本体感觉状态会导致性能下降，原因是训练与部署时的本体感觉分布存在显著差异。

Method: 提出领域适应框架，利用部署时的滚动数据，通过Wasserstein距离量化差异并添加噪声以最小化分布差距。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于忽略本体感觉的简单方案及其他基线方法，能有效利用本体感觉并减少负面影响。

Conclusion: 通过分布对齐策略，该方法成功解决了本体感觉偏移问题，提升了模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Method: 通过分析对称VASS中不同群（如对称群、交替群、循环群）的性质，研究可达性问题的计算复杂性，并与一般VASS的复杂度进行对比。

Result: 对称群下的可达性问题可在PSPACE内解决，而一般VASS的复杂度为Ackermannian。其他群（如交替群和循环群）的情况也被探讨。

Conclusion: 对称群显著降低了VASS可达性问题的复杂性，为数据VASS的可达性问题提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems
with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of
permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields
general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the
reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of
input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We
also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones.
Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data
VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination
of the trivial and symmetric groups.

Abstract: Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have traditionally been conceptualized as
data-driven models designed to support decision-making across various domains.
However, recent advancements in conversational AI open new possibilities for
HDTs to function as authentic, interactive digital counterparts of individuals.
This paper introduces a novel HDT system architecture that integrates large
language models with dynamically updated personal data, enabling it to mirror
an individual's conversational style, memories, and behaviors. To achieve this,
our approach implements context-aware memory retrieval, neural
plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning mechanisms, creating a
more natural and evolving digital persona. The resulting system does not only
replicate an individual's unique conversational style depending on who they are
speaking with, but also enriches responses with dynamically captured personal
experiences, opinions, and memories. While this marks a significant step toward
developing authentic virtual counterparts, it also raises critical ethical
concerns regarding privacy, accountability, and the long-term implications of
persistent digital identities. This study contributes to the field of HDTs by
describing our novel system architecture, demonstrating its capabilities, and
discussing future directions and emerging challenges to ensure the responsible

Result: SABRE-FL在五个数据集上显著降低后门攻击准确率，同时保持干净输入的准确性。

Conclusion: SABRE-FL展示了强大的防御性能，强调了未来联邦系统中提示学习的鲁棒性需求。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and
privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP
across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup
remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor
attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients
inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the
global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while
still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this
vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters
poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained
offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client
data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both
theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably
identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse
datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by
significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy,
demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust
prompt learning in future federated systems.

Result: VERA在多种目标LLM上表现优异，验证了概率推理在对抗提示生成中的价值。

Conclusion: VERA提供了一种高效且全面的黑盒越狱方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Conclusion: 通用自主网络安全防御（GACD）系统有望在动态网络环境中实现更高效的威胁检测和响应。

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

Result: UniGuard在多种模态（图像、文本、音频）和任务（分类和回归）中表现出高效性和有效性，优于现有的专门检测方法。

Conclusion: UniGuard是首个能够统一检测对抗性示例和后门攻击的框架，其性能优于现有方法，适用于广泛的攻击策略。

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable
of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.
UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have
to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them
simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial
input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in
backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign
sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.
The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of
its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be
fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due
to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation
trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation
to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are
subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness
have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and
audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model
architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks,
including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to
SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED
(IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently
demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's
strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of
attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

*Tung-Ling Li,Hongliang Liu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为logit-gap steering的快速越狱框架，通过单次词汇表遍历解决RLHF对齐语言模型的拒绝-确认差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效地绕过RLHF对齐语言模型的安全限制，同时揭示安全调优对模型内部表征的影响。

Method: 使用前向可计算的分数结合差距减少、KL惩罚和奖励偏移的轻量级代理，通过“排序-求和-停止”扫描快速生成短后缀。

Result: 该方法在0.5B到70B的模型上均有效，将单次攻击成功率提升至80-100%，并保持主题连贯性。

Conclusion: logit-gap steering不仅高效，还揭示了安全调优的边界奖励悬崖等特征，为模型对齐提供了轻量级分析工具。

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

Abstract: One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automating this task using
artificial intelligence is a complex process due to the inherent class
imbalance and lack of sufficient labeled samples of real-world datasets. This
research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to
improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In
this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting
DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and
shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments.
The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs) that are robust against class imbalance and handle partially

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MetaCipher是一种新型的基于混淆的越狱框架，通过强化学习动态选择加密策略，显著提高了攻击成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）面临日益复杂的混淆攻击，现有防御机制难以应对加密内容的解析需求。

Method: 提出MetaCipher框架，结合强化学习的动态加密策略选择机制，支持多种加密方式并适应对抗策略的演变。

Result: 在10次查询内，MetaCipher对非推理型LLM的攻击成功率达92%，对推理型LLM达74%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaCipher具有长期鲁棒性和适应性，能够有效应对不断升级的安全措施。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to
increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based
attacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly
effective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret
encrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on
keyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to
defend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or
decode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel
obfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement
learning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses
optimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances
jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim
LLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design,
supporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial
strategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of
cipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries,
MetaCipher achieves over 92\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard
malicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and
over 74\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing
obfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term
robustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than
prior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.

Motivation: 集中式数据管理存在隐私泄露、安全漏洞和用户自主权不足的问题，亟需一种新的方法来保护个人数据。

Method: 采用去中心化架构，结合安全飞地和联邦学习等隐私增强技术，支持本地计算、模型训练和安全数据共享。

Result: 系统实现了用户对数据的完全控制，确保隐私保护的同时支持多功能操作。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨行业数据管理提供了一种隐私优先的解决方案。

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized
management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security
vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information.
Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail
to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and
unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental
paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal
data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance.
  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture
that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational
credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models,
our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to
selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's
foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure
enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and
data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local
computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while
ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

Abstract: With current advancement in hybermedia knowledges, the privacy of digital
information has developed a critical problem. To overawed the susceptibilities
of present security protocols, scholars tend to focus mainly on efforts on
alternation of current protocols. Over past decade, various proposed encoding
models have been shown insecurity, leading to main threats against significant
data. Utilizing the suitable encryption model is very vital means of guard
against various such, but algorithm is selected based on the dependency of data
which need to be secured. Moreover, testing potentiality of the security
assessment one by one to identify the best choice can take a vital time for
processing. For faster and precisive identification of assessment algorithm, we
suggest a security phase exposure model for cipher encryption technique by
invoking Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work, we form a dataset using
usual security components like contrast, homogeneity. To overcome the
uncertainty in analysing the security and lack of ability of processing data to
a risk assessment mechanism. To overcome with such complications, this paper
proposes an assessment model for security issues using fuzzy evidential
reasoning (ER) approaches. Significantly, the model can be utilised to process
and assemble risk assessment data on various aspects in systematic ways. To
estimate the performance of our framework, we have various analyses like,
recall, F1 score and accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured
function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for
real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration.
Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent
protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting
in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we
introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems,
spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary
capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack
techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains:
Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal
adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level
backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies),
System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership
inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol
Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent
Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess
real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat
taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such
as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic
provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and
achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work
provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense
mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

Conclusion: MH-AutoML在性能和可解释性方面均表现出色，适用于网络安全应用。

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise
and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has
emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as
black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment
traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a
domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates
the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering,
algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates
capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are
often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML
against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT,
HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML
achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The
framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions,
making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and
explainability matter.

Conclusion: 通过整合现有方法，可以更有效地解决联邦学习中的安全聚合带来的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables private and collaborative
learning from decentralised data without leaking sensitive client information.
However, secure aggregation also complicates the detection of malicious client
behaviour and the evaluation of individual client contributions to the
learning. To address these challenges, QI (Pejo et al.) and FedGT (Xhemrishi et
al.) were proposed for contribution evaluation (CE) and misbehaviour detection
(MD), respectively. QI, however, lacks adequate MD accuracy due to its reliance
on the random selection of clients in each training round, while FedGT lacks
the CE ability. In this work, we combine the strengths of QI and FedGT to
achieve both robust MD and accurate CE. Our experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to using either method independently.

Result: 研究发现现有防御在语义层面存在显著不足，尤其是针对上下文推断和潜在表示泄漏的保护。

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决语义泄漏量化、多模态输入保护、隐私与生成质量的平衡，以及隐私执行的透明度等挑战。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting
information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as
semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a
lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across
input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We
categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as
differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning,
address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level
protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation
leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying
semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification
with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This
work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware
privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Conclusion: 内部语义信息对恢复混淆代码至关重要。

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by
converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA
has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and
cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods
often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their
internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table,
which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an
expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table
is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all
possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided
MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural
encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression
semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of
internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original
form.

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an
area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry,
and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is
hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of
the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset
consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the
general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API
outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and
provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads
APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a
methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches
the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of
differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of
private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of
differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over
time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces
and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.
Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset
obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to
analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic
large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering
transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of malware classification using machine
learning by developing a novel dataset labeled at both the malware type and
family levels. Raw binaries were collected from sources such as VirusShare, VX
Underground, and MalwareBazaar, and subsequently labeled with family
information parsed from binary names and type-level labels integrated from
ClarAVy. The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was
processed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis,
particularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support
advanced classification tasks. The evaluation was focused on three key
classification tasks. In the binary classification of malware versus benign
samples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets,
reaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection.
When using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under
limited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6%
for type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass
classification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the
models reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on
family-level tasks. In the multiclass classification setting, which assigns
samples to the correct type or family, SVM achieved 81.1% accuracy on type
labels, while Random Forest and XGBoost reached approximately 73.4% on family
labels. The results highlight practical trade-offs between accuracy and
computational cost, and demonstrate that labeling at both the type and family
levels enables more fine-grained and insightful malware classification. The
work establishes a robust foundation for future research on advanced malware
detection and classification.

Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many
applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music
transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised
learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for
the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties
of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and
polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised
methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by
incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and
pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial
improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that
applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further
improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model
simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used
for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our
insights on the underlying problem.

Result: 结果显示，全状态观测下模型表现良好，但部分观测时面临变量选择和未观测自由度参数化的挑战。物理基础策略（如粗粒化和随机参数化）被证明是关键。

Conclusion: 结论强调物理基础策略对复杂系统（如气候系统）模拟的重要性，并通过海表温度场的随机简化模型验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of
multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic
climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary
statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current
autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically
struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical
system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in
high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models
under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another
with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,
the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses
in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial
observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper}
variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees
of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect
fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow
dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as
coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both
conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems
like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more
realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface
temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,
assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and
interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI导师队友如何通过激发好奇心行为提升学生在分子动力学任务中的参与度和学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在互动学习环境中如何通过好奇心和响应行为激发学生的主动提问和认知复杂性。

Method: 采用Wizard-of-Oz范式，通过混合方法设计，11名高中生参与4项逐步复杂的分子动力学任务，评估团队表现和沟通行为。

Result: 高性能团队表现出更深入的理解和参与度，AI的好奇心触发行为与高级问题相关，CRQA指标显示动态同步。

Conclusion: AI作为队友和教育者的双重角色能提供适应性反馈，维持学生的好奇心和参与度。

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate
(AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during
Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics
platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response
behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the
frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further
assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery
curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment.
Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI
tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a
mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students
participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and
calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team
performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas
team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's
curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification
Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were
linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior
task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced
questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened
engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic
synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive
engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that
the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide
adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.

Motivation: 现有在线渠道无法满足吸毒人群的动态需求，LLMs提供了新机会，但其应用在高风险领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过定性研讨会，汇集学者、减害实践者和社区管理者，探讨LLMs的潜力、用例和设计考虑。

Result: LLMs能解决部分信息障碍（如多语言、去污名化交互），但需克服伦理对齐、上下文理解等挑战。

Conclusion: 强调与专家和吸毒人群共同设计，开发安全、负责任的LLMs系统，为减害领域提供支持。

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly
impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online
channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations
in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large
Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information
provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored
and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can
be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a
qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm
reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM
capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design
considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing
information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and
potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent
upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction
principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and
clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways
emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM
systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes
empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the
responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction
ecosystem.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨AI如何通过“softmaxing culture”现象同质化语言和文化，提出从“what is culture”转向“when is culture”的评估方法，强调文化复杂性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型正在同质化语言和文化，导致文化多样性被削弱，现有评估方法（如ML和HCI）对此问题有限。

Method: 提出两个关键转变：1. 从“what is culture”转向“when is culture”；2. 将文化普遍性与具体情境结合。

Result: 现有评估方法不足以应对文化复杂性，需引入更灵活的视角。

Conclusion: 呼吁超越技术需求，采用更响应文化复杂性的评估方法，以促进AI系统的文化对齐。

Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad
ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging
out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this
phenomenon "softmaxing culture," and it is one of the fundamental challenges
facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of
culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.
This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer
interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key
shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system
evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second,
while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the
challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to
their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation
approaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more
responsive to the complexities of culture.

TL;DR: CSBrain是一种跨尺度时空脑基础模型，通过多尺度特征聚合和结构化稀疏注意力，显著提升了EEG信号解码的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有跨尺度的时空结构特性，而现有模型忽略了这一点，导致表示和泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST)和Structured Sparse Attention (SSA)方法，交替堆叠以整合多尺度依赖关系。

Result: 在11个EEG任务和16个数据集上，CSBrain表现优于任务专用模型和其他基础模型。

Conclusion: 跨尺度建模是关键归纳偏差，CSBrain为未来脑-AI研究提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in
cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While
recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified
architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense
modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core
property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task
patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to
slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed
interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and
weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain
foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i)
Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale
features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into
compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which
captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity
while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to
progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks
across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and
foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a
key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future
brain-AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便携式EEG设备（如Muse头带）在移动性上具有优势，但信号的非平稳性限制了数据质量和解码精度。

Method: 提出MuseCogNet框架，结合自监督重建损失（基于平均池化）和监督交叉熵损失，模拟人类注意力机制。

Result: 在公开Muse数据集上显著优于现有方法，为生态环境中的神经认知监测提供了可行路径。

Conclusion: MuseCogNet通过联合学习框架有效解决了便携性与性能的权衡问题。

Abstract: Portable and wearable consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices,
like Muse headbands, offer unprecedented mobility for daily brain-computer
interface (BCI) applications, including cognitive load detection. However, the
exacerbated non-stationarity in portable EEG signals constrains data fidelity
and decoding accuracy, creating a fundamental trade-off between portability and
performance. To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based
Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating
self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce
an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to
capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines
task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles
the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse
dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in
ecological settings.

Motivation: 思维链内容冗长且缺乏组织，难以审查，且缺乏用户反馈机会。

Method: 引入交互式推理设计，并在原型系统Hippo中实现，支持用户对模型推理过程进行干预。

Result: 用户研究表明，交互式推理能帮助用户快速识别错误、定制响应并更好地理解模型推理和输出。

Conclusion: 该工作为将用户监督纳入LLM推理过程提供了新范式。

Abstract: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via
"reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further
condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains
contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization,
making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user
feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or
clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction
design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and
enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in
Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain
trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive
reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous
generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and
better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes
to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning
processes.

Conclusion: 提出了一个框架，包括角色规范、失效机制和反思实践，以保护领域特定自主性。

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of
professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has
examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on
domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within
defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI
decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy:
skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain)
and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant
values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing
empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we
demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential
for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both
immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for
autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical
design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of
defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help
maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This
framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance
rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

Motivation: AI在教育中的普及引发了评估方式是否仍有效的疑问，研究旨在探讨如何调整评估以适应AI的影响。

Method: 基于Constructive Alignment理论和Bloom分类法，分析AI对不同学习目标的影响，并提出评估调整建议。

Result: 发现教师对AI在评估中的使用存在偏见，建议制定结构化指南并提供教师培训。

Conclusion: 教育评估需适应AI的影响，教师培训和对AI的了解是关键。

Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large
Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models
are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current
forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and
comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in
Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning
objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom
levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.
Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment
should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be
adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which
lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a
lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.
To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty
level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that
teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI
tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

Motivation: 探讨量子机器学习中频谱偏差的成因及其对训练动态的影响，特别是在参数化量子电路（PQCs）中的表现。

Method: 利用PQCs的傅里叶级数表示，分析傅里叶系数的冗余性及其与梯度大小的关系，并通过三种编码方案进行实验验证。

Result: 发现傅里叶系数的冗余性与梯度大小强相关，且冗余性高的PQCs对参数扰动更具鲁棒性。设计选择（如参数初始化规模和纠缠结构）会影响学习效率。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差在PQCs中源于傅里叶系数的冗余性，设计选择对训练动态有显著影响，冗余性高的电路更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum
machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit
low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than
high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence.
We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs).
Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that
spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier
coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the
model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding
scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find
that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training
strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further
demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit
increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the
corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability
of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and
entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement
schemes tend to slow convergence.

Result: 该方法适用于多种量子态，包括纯态、近纯态和哈密顿基态。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在低秩分解近似下具有高效性，适用于广泛的量子态。

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the
state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing
the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground
states of Hamiltonians.

Method: 在受害HQNN的变分量子电路中插入SWAP门，导致量子比特错位和状态演化破坏。

Result: 非目标攻击降低分类准确率高达74.08%，目标攻击降低目标类准确率高达79.78%。

Conclusion: SQUASH攻击暴露了HQNN的关键漏洞，需设计更抗干扰的架构。

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Conclusion: 透明结合文本与结构化信号的简单混合模型在准确性和可解释性上表现优异，为决策者提供实用见解。

Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for
investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching
impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S.
federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies.
Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often
fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank
communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by
integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal
Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional
machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning
architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal
baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of
FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test
AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but
perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP
analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with
policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and
structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler
hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering
actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.

Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice,
also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive
procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a
treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to
efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the
highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation
phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we
allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate
clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we
allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first
stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the
treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest
sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this
single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for
the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact
constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency
limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Conclusion: 自适应比特分配策略显著提升了SNN的效率和准确性，为解决多比特SNN的资源分配问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated
research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with
more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to
the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on
the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra
bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit
allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise
allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and
accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and
the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable
through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths
and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle
different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal
lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically
formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may
incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size
renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,
including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and
DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and
computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our
SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit
budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully
open-sourced.

### [451] [Marker Gene Method : Identifying Stable Solutions in a Dynamic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23734)
*Hao Shi,Xi Li,Fangfang Xie*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出Marker Gene Method (MGM)，通过动态基准和自适应权重机制提升CCEAs的稳定性，理论证明其接近纳什均衡，并在多个实验中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CCEAs中因复杂动态（如不可传递性和红皇后效应）导致的不稳定收敛问题。

Method: 引入MGM框架，使用‘标记基因’作为动态基准，结合自适应权重机制平衡探索与开发。

Result: MGM在严格竞争博弈框架中接近纳什均衡，实验表明其在Rock-Paper-Scissors、ZDT基准和Shapley Biased Game中均表现优异。

Conclusion: MGM是一个理论严谨且实证有效的框架，显著提升了CCEAs在复杂竞争环境中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex
dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable
convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene
Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene'
as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance
exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs
demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within
the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its
efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D
on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it
successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work
presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that
substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex
competitive environments.

TL;DR: Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS) 是一种高效的两层脉冲神经网络，用于实时、低功耗的边缘端尖峰排序，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口中实时、低功耗且高性能的尖峰排序需求。

Method: 利用局部竞争算法（LCA）进行稀疏编码，结合定制神经元模型，支持多比特尖峰编码。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，NSS 性能优于 WaveClus3 和 PCA+KMeans，F1 分数提高 10%，功耗为 8.6mW。

Conclusion: NSS 是一种高效且灵活的尖峰排序方法，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural
signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key
challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power
spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This
study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer
spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the
Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant
features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to
sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely
unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic
platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling
flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths.
Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift
showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans.
With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with
leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10%
improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting
recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per
inference.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何开发既准确又安全可信的AI系统，强调了AI安全的重要性，并提出了新的研究议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前复杂AI模型的推理和内部机制对用户不透明，且缺乏预测的安全性保证，因此需要开发安全可靠的AI系统。

Method: 通过组织研讨会，汇集NSF SLES项目资助的研究人员和更广泛的AI安全研究者，讨论安全问题的不同方面。

Result: 研讨会提出了新的研究议程，旨在开发理论、方法和工具，为下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Conclusion: AI安全是未来发展的关键，需要跨学科合作以推动安全可信的AI系统研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation
models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions
to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's
complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety
guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of
AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based
systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and
trustworthy?
  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous
systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning
Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI
applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving
treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less
well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the
organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on
February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES
program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is
the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different
aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda
focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the
foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出类似赌博心理的系统性风险行为，需要一种方法来识别和纠正这些行为。

Method: 提出了Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)框架，结合风险校准训练、损失规避机制和不确定性感知决策。

Result: 实验结果显示，RARG显著减少了赌博心理行为：过度自信偏差降低18.7%，损失追逐倾向减少24.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了系统性框架，用于理解和减轻AI系统中的赌博心理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors
analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence
bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from
behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these
"gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward
outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically
miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)
framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these
behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,
and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation
paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI
adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like
behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in
loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse
scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for
understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“激进提问”（RQ）的框架，用于在AI项目启动前进行伦理评估，以避免技术解决方案主义对社会问题的简化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术干预可能简化复杂社会问题，强化权力不平衡，甚至对边缘化社区造成伤害，尤其是在人口贩卖（HT）等领域。

Method: 提出五步RQ框架，作为项目前的伦理评估工具，用于批判性评估是否应开发AI，并考虑权力映射和潜在危害。

Result: 通过HT案例研究，RQ揭示了被忽视的社会文化复杂性，并引导从监控干预转向幸存者赋权工具。

Conclusion: RQ框架可推广至其他领域，挑战工具主义规范，强调关系性和反思性责任。

Abstract: AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical
interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human
trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation,
reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims
to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework
as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate
whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized
populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles
based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to
confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case
study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural
complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward
survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five
step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions
must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics
philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational,
reflexive responsibility.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在复杂政策问题中的潜力，并分析气候紧急运动对地方政府政策的影响。

Method: 构建PALLM系统，使用GPT-4分析维多利亚州11个地方政府的政策文件，并与政策制定者验证结果。

Result: 通过CED的议会更可能制定近期且针对气候的政策，并更关注紧迫性、优先级和社会公正。GPT-4在政策分析中表现良好，但存在引用不可靠的局限性。

Conclusion: 大规模分析政策文件为政策研究提供了新机会，GPT-4在政策分析中具有潜力，但需解决局限性。

Abstract: This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local
government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency
movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through
the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series
of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the
aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer
complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM
(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.
This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency
response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the
performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by
generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria
and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.
Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to
conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local
governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the
methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils
which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is
capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of
reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.
Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more
likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to
urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which
have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale
opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.

Motivation: 研究NLP系统中对性取向的偏见编码和误表示，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过调查和分析55篇量化性取向NLP偏见的文献，定义和操作化性取向。

Result: 发现性取向定义模糊，常与性别混淆，导致对性取向偏见的错误量化。

Conclusion: 建议更深入与性少数群体和跨学科文献合作，改进性取向NLP偏见分析。

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as
wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of
multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and
amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this
scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and
(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work
in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and
operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify
sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a
majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or
normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we
find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often
conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of
queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving
sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that
encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and
interdisciplinary literature.

Motivation: 探讨LLM政治倾向测试（PCT）的有效性及其编码机制。

Method: 通过分析标准生成参数、提示变化和微调对PCT分数的影响，以及不同政治内容数据集微调的效果。

Result: 标准生成参数对PCT分数影响小；提示变化和微调显著影响分数；高政治内容数据集微调未导致分数差异。

Conclusion: 需深入研究PCT测试的有效性及LLM政治倾向的编码机制。

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to
quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that
examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard
generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores.
However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning
individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that
when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than
others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a
thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as
the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

GPT4DFCI was able to identify copyrighted material and reproduce exact quotes
from famous books which indicates that copyrighted material was in the training
data. The model was not able to reproduce content from our target news article,
scientific article, or electronic health records. However, there were instances
of fabrication. As a result of this event, a mitigation strategy is in
production in GPT4DFCI v2.8.2, deployed on January 21, 2025. We hope this

Method: 提出Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS)框架，分析LLMs在用户界面简化与复杂性转移中的动态。

Result: LLMs通过简化用户界面掩盖了复杂性向组织内部的转移，竞争优势需通过管理这种复杂性实现。

Conclusion: AI战略的关键在于管理复杂性转移，通过抽象层设计、工作流对齐和互补专业知识实现竞争优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to
analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and
competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input
costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among
generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity
across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by
offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this
user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to
infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off,
therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the
organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy
in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer
stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity
through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary
expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition
relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.

Result: 实验显示该方法显著提升了A/B测试的统计功效，降低了实验成本。

Conclusion: 该方法通过SCLT证明了在零假设和备择假设下的分布特性，为检测微小效应提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in
large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a
significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal
distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor
effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with
sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework
and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by
weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The
implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and
efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates
that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null
hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis,
greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a
significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to
reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.

Motivation: 现有扩散采样方法因缺乏显式目标样本，常需复杂学习过程或重要性加权估计，限制了实用性。

Method: 基于Schrödinger Bridge理论，通过Adjoint Matching实现高效采样，放宽了无记忆条件。

Result: ASBS在经典能量函数、构象生成和分子Boltzmann分布采样中表现出色。

Conclusion: ASBS是一种简单、可扩展且高效的扩散采样方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution
-- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy
function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit
target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion
samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning
processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy
and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose
Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that
employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to
estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical
model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via
kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal
control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned
at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution.
Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to
arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition
that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy
functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann
distributions.

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过假设检验或正则化优化解决不变特征识别问题，但存在局限性，因此需要更高效和准确的方法。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，BIP和VI-BIP比现有方法更准确且可扩展。

Conclusion: BIP方法在不变特征识别中表现出色，且环境异质性越高，后验收敛速度越快。

Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from
multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable
predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to
new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have
primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized
optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a
probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of
invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior
inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior
targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent
and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior
contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational
approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and
VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant
prediction.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集中，CN-SBM表现出优于现有方法的模型拟合效果，并在TCGA数据中识别出临床相关亚型。

Conclusion: CN-SBM为CNV分析提供了一个可解释、可扩展的框架，对肿瘤异质性和预后具有直接意义。

Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by
tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number
Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly
clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using
a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or
Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and
captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a
two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual
components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and
finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for
application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated
and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to
TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and
structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival
analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable
framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and
prognosis.

Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge,
hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly
in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic
significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression
or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental
contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under
the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test
set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful,
randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing
feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for
estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal
assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains
computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings.
Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational
advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical
utility.

samples, based on the DeepParticle methods. The proposed method leads to a
min-min optimization during training and does not impose any restriction on the
network structure. Theoretically we establish a weak convergence guarantee and
a quantitative error bound between the learned map and the optimal transport
map. Our numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and the
effectiveness of the new approach, particularly on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of input features differs
between the training and testing phases. In covariate shift, estimating an
unknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored,
despite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
investigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target
distributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a
logarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first
trains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and
then uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment
estimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically
unknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable. To solve this
problem, we propose a truncated version of the estimator that ensures double
robustness and provide the corresponding upper bound. Extensive numerical
studies on synthetic examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Bures Wasserstein流形上评估Frechet回归的部分效应需要一种有效的测试方法，以验证模型的准确性和实用性。

Method: 采用样本分割策略：第一子样本用于拟合Frechet回归模型，第二子样本用于构建测试统计量。

Result: 统计量渐近收敛于加权卡方混合分布，测试方法具有名义渐近大小，且最坏情况下功效一致收敛于1。

Conclusion: 通过模拟和实际数据验证了测试方法的有限样本准确性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel test for assessing partial effects in Frechet regression
on Bures Wasserstein manifolds. Our approach employs a sample splitting
strategy: the first subsample is used to fit the Frechet regression model,
yielding estimates of the covariance matrices and their associated optimal
transport maps, while the second subsample is used to construct the test
statistic. We prove that this statistic converges in distribution to a weighted
mixture of chi squared components, where the weights correspond to the
eigenvalues of an integral operator defined by an appropriate RKHS kernel. We
establish that our procedure achieves the nominal asymptotic size and
demonstrate that its worst-case power converges uniformly to one. Through
extensive simulations and a real data application, we illustrate the test's
finite-sample accuracy and practical utility.
