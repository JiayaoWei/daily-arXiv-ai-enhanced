performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours

### [2] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)
*Neil Rathi,Dan Jurafsky,Kaitlyn Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在过度自信问题，导致用户过度依赖其生成内容。不同语言对不确定性标记的使用和解释差异显著，增加了模型在全球范围内的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在多语言环境中的校准问题，特别是过度自信和用户过度依赖的风险，以确保其全球部署的安全性。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的不确定性标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对模型生成内容的依赖行为。

Result: LLMs在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但能反映语言差异（如日语中不确定性标记最多，德语和中文中确定性标记最多）。用户在所有语言中均高度依赖模型生成内容，但依赖行为因语言而异（如日语用户更依赖不确定性表达）。

Conclusion: 多语言校准面临挑战，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

TL;DR: ETT方法通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长序列时面临二次计算和内存开销的问题，限制了其应用范围。

Method: ETT通过将输入上下文分块为重叠子序列，并在测试时微调模型参数，实现上下文长度的扩展。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 微调FFN的第二层比全微调更有效，进一步提高了模型准确率。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型是统一形式、分布和接地语义理论的潜在路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何评估分词器质量，扩展了MorphScore以支持70种语言，并发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词是语言建模的关键步骤，但目前缺乏有效的分词器质量评估方法，尤其是如何衡量分词器是否保留语言学上有意义的子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，改进其灵活性，并通过与下游任务性能的相关性分析形态对齐的影响。

Result: 形态对齐对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明其单独不足以衡量与模型性能相关的分词器质量维度。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键指标，需进一步探索其他评估维度。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

Motivation: 研究句法结构的代数性质及其与操作系统的关系，以统一解释句法生成和移动规则。

Conclusion: 着色操作系统为句法结构的生成和移动提供了统一的数学描述，扩展了句法理论的形式化工具。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

TL;DR: PERK是一种高效的长上下文推理方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码上下文，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文推理中现有元学习方法内存消耗过高的问题。

Method: 采用双嵌套优化循环，内循环将上下文编码到低秩适配器（LoRA），外循环学习使用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，性能提升显著（GPT-2提升90%，Qwen-2.5-0.5B提升27%）。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存消耗高，但在推理时更高效，且对上下文复杂性、长度和信息位置更鲁棒。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效，且现有方法依赖先验知识，实用性受限。

Method: 通过奖励引导的解码方法发现失败模式，并利用自改进框架REFORM生成对抗样本以增强训练数据。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提升了鲁棒性，同时保持奖励质量和对齐性能。

Conclusion: REFORM无需先验知识即可提升奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

Motivation: 理解政策语言的演变对评估全球应对复杂挑战（如气候变化）至关重要，但传统方法效率低下且难以捕捉复杂性。

Method: 采用动态嵌入主题模型（DETM）分析1995至2023年UNFCCC政策决策的语料库，排除2020年数据。

Result: 模型揭示了政策重点从温室气体和国际公约转向实施、技术合作、能力建设、资金和全球协议。

Conclusion: DETM是分析全球政策语言演变的有效工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Result: 在多模态基准测试中整体提升4.4%，视觉依赖任务中提升近8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为RLVR学习目标引入了感知感知监督，为视觉基础推理的新RL框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Conclusion: 该方法通过代码生成和数据增强，显著提升了时间归一化的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Conclusion: 选择性门控、分层递归和可控遗忘对混合模型至关重要，推荐HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet架构。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在临床文本生成中面临的患者数据非结构化和长文本语义密集的问题。

Method: 引入分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上生成的结构化进展笔记平均对齐得分为87.7%，优于临床医生撰写的笔记（80.7%）。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG在临床文本生成中表现出色，具有高一致性和可靠性，适合临床应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

*Dahyun Lee,Yongrae Jo,Haeju Park,Moontae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种基于集合的段落选择方法，通过Chain-of-Thought推理明确查询的信息需求，并选择最优段落集合，显著提升了多跳问答中的检索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重排序，难以满足复杂查询的信息需求。

Method: 提出SETR方法，通过Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的替代传统重排序方法的选择。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

*Zicong Tang,Shi Luohe,Zuchao Li,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu,Lefei Zhang,Ping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpindleKV是一种新型的KV缓存减少方法，通过平衡浅层和深层的处理，优化了LLMs的推理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存内存消耗高的问题，特别是浅层缓存减少不足的挑战。

Method: 深层采用基于注意力权重的淘汰方法，浅层使用基于相似性和合并策略的码本替换方法。

Result: 在两个常见基准测试和三种不同LLMs上，SpindleKV在减少KV缓存方面优于基线方法，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SpindleKV有效解决了KV缓存冗余问题，特别是在浅层和GQA注意力机制中的表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

TL;DR: SCoRE是一个模块化、低成本的句子级关系抽取系统，支持预训练语言模型的灵活切换，无需微调，适用于多样化的语料库和知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足在低监督环境下高效利用外部语料库进行知识图谱扩展的需求，同时适应噪声标注的远程监督数据。

Method: 结合监督对比学习和贝叶斯k近邻分类器进行多标签分类，提出两个新评估指标：CSD和P@R，并发布Wiki20d基准数据集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，SCoRE性能优于或匹配现有方法，同时显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: SCoRE凭借高效、模块化和可扩展性，成为现实世界关系抽取应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

Motivation: 解决行为金融中LLMs与投资者决策对齐的挑战，尤其是真实用户数据稀缺导致的SFT成本高和隐私风险问题。

Method: 提出InvestAlign框架，利用理论解决方案生成高质量SFT数据集，并开发InvestAgent进行微调。

Result: InvestAlign生成的数据训练LLMs参数收敛更快，InvestAgent在简单和复杂投资问题中更接近真实用户数据。

Conclusion: InvestAlign是一种有前景的方法，可解决复杂投资问题并提升LLMs与投资者决策的对齐效果。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业合同信息抽取任务中，高质量数据集的缺乏和模型鲁棒性不足是主要挑战。

Method: 通过聚类分析、GPT-4/GPT-3.5标注关键信息、数据增强（生成新文本）构建高质量数据集，并微调大语言模型。

Result: 模型在保证高召回率和精度的同时，解析效率优异；LoRA、数据平衡和数据增强显著提升模型准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业合同信息抽取任务提供了新颖高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将人类与大型语言模型（LLM）平等视为节点的网络模型，分析了四种危害（偏离真相、自我修复、新造内容、外部检测），并开发了数学模型和开源算法（FOO）以提高网络可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与LLM互动的新媒介，解决LLM在事实性、逻辑性和结构性上的问题，提出网络化方法以提高可靠性。

Method: 开发了基于节点（人类和LLM）的讨论网络模型，定义四种危害，并设计数学模型和FOO算法实现互评机制。

Result: 仅依赖偏离和自我修复的网络会稳定在较低错误率；加入新造内容会重现当前LLM的高错误率；互评机制可显著提升真实性。

Conclusion: 通过将不完美的模型联网并互评，可显著提高新媒介的可靠性，而非依赖单一模型的完美化。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品领域QA中知识整合与多模态生成的挑战，提升回答的可靠性与多样性。

Method: 构建大规模多模态知识图谱，生成QA对，联合微调LLaMA和Stable Diffusion模型，采用混合检索-生成策略。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率94.1%，合成充分性85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成结合显著提升了食品QA的可靠性与多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gated Memory Unit（GMU）的机制，用于在SSM层之间高效共享内存，并基于此构建了SambaY架构，显著提升了解码效率和长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合架构（如Samba和YOCO）未探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力，因此提出GMU机制以优化性能。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构，结合Samba自解码器和跨解码器，共享内存读取状态。

Result: SambaY显著提升解码效率，保持线性预填充时间，并在长上下文任务中表现优异，无需显式位置编码。最大模型在推理任务中性能优于基线，解码吞吐量提升10倍。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构在效率和性能上具有显著优势，适用于大规模计算场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

TL;DR: FuDoBa是一种基于贝叶斯优化的方法，结合LLM嵌入与领域特定知识，生成低维、任务相关的表示，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域特定应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Method: 通过贝叶斯优化整合LLM嵌入与本地及外部知识（如WikiData），生成低维表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或与专有LLM嵌入基线相当。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效结合LLM与领域知识，生成高效且可解释的表示。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过大型语言模型（LLMs）和审查协议加速这一过程。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据提取准确率低（9.6%和15.8%），总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数低。

Conclusion: 建议进一步评估LLMs在不同审查上下文中的性能，并报告其表现，同时LLM反馈有助于协议改进。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

Motivation: 研究旨在量化精英极化现象，通过分析政治家在议会演讲中提及彼此的方式及其情感色彩，揭示党派间的敌意程度。

Method: 利用人工智能技术检测演讲中的发言者和被提及对象，并评估其情感温度，构建了一个跨党派敌意指数。研究覆盖了英国过去40年以及匈牙利和意大利过去20年的数据。

Result: 研究结果可按政党和季度汇总，指数显示出良好的表面效度，能够反映选举活动、国家和政党危机等事件的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来构建欧盟范围内20年的精英极化时间序列数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何内部表示和处理预测，以检测不确定性和防止幻觉。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹。

Result: 确定和不确定预测的轨迹一致，且在相似层出现置信度突增；更优秀的模型可能学会不同处理不确定性。

Conclusion: 挑战了简单方法检测不确定性的可行性，展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的应用。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%

Result: 在多种语言和基准数据集上，CE-Judge表现优于基线模型，与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: CE-Judge为多语言文本评估提供了一种高效、低成本且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）虽为企业应用提供机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此小规模模型（sLLMs）成为实用替代方案。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）方法，应用于多种基础模型和服务领域，并通过实验和实际评估验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，DACP应用于sLLMs能显著提升目标领域性能，同时保留通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP为小规模语言模型提供了一种成本高效且可扩展的企业级部署解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和SE指标为推理扩展提供了高效且协调的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示GUI代理视觉接地过程中的安全漏洞，特别是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过污染预训练数据误导代理将文本计划定位到触发位置而非目标。

Result: 实验显示，仅5%污染数据和隐蔽视觉触发即可高效攻击，且攻击能泛化至下游任务和不同GUI环境。

Conclusion: GUI代理的后门攻击风险亟需进一步研究。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，测试Llama 3和GPT-4o在预测导师策略和学生成果上的表现。

Result: 即使最先进的LLMs也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生成果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来改进导师策略预测任务。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Motivation: 当前代码生成评估基准（如HumanEval和LiveCodeBench）的测试用例数量有限且同质化，导致性能评估不准确，影响强化学习框架中的奖励估计。

Method: 提出多维度指标量化测试套件的全面性，并开发人机协作方法SAGA，结合人类编程经验和LLM推理能力，生成高质量测试用例。同时建立TCGBench作为研究平台。

Conclusion: 该方法为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展的基础，推动了代码生成中强化学习的进展，并为自动化对抗测试和自适应基准集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为敏感数据行业提供了解决方案，支持数据本地化和细粒度访问控制。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Conclusion: MEWI是高保真医疗教育工具的重要进步，为改进联合部队的医疗后送教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned

challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and

aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the

Result: 通过模拟验证了检测方法的有效性，为理解AI发展轨迹及其对通用人工智能（AGI）出现的影响提供了数学基础。

Conclusion: 研究为AI发展轨迹的潜在后果提供了见解，支持未来研究和政策制定。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

Motivation: 研究辩证系统的不同模型，解决文献中关于q-辩证系统与p-辩证系统相对能力的开放性问题。

Method: 通过数学证明比较d-、p-和q-辩证系统的能力。

Result: q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，p-辩证系统严格强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 反例和矛盾在自动信念修正和数学推理中具有互补作用。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架中，提出了两种方法，并通过Baroni和Giacomin的标准评估其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC递归语义在有限论证框架中有效，但在无限框架中因缺乏良基性而失效，需要扩展以适应无限场景。

Method: 提出了两种扩展SCC递归语义的方法，并系统评估其在无限和有限框架中的表现。

Result: 在无限框架中方向性普遍失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究为无限论证理论奠定了基础，支持处理无界或动态领域的推理系统。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集在覆盖范围和深度上有限，导致模型在复杂指令和罕见领域任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型诊断生成，形成闭环迭代框架。

Result: 构建了包含150万指令的高质量数据集InfinityInstruct-Subject，实验证明其提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

Method: 提出三个协作代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间定位和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（提供精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG应对行程中断）。

Result: 系统在查询解释、导航准确性和抗干扰能力方面表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等应用中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题，需要更有效的探索方法。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，通过识别高不确定性决策点并进行针对性探索，构建语义基础的中间反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E实现了更稳定的训练、更长的连贯回答，并提高了完全正确轨迹的比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过结构化探索有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对无效曝光样本的分析不足，且忽视了伪正样本的影响（如点击仅为访问营销门户），需要一种更全面的解决方案。

Method: 框架包含两部分：用户意图感知的负采样模块过滤无效曝光样本，以及意图驱动的双去偏模块联合校正曝光偏差和点击偏差。

Result: 在淘宝的在线实验中，框架显著提升了用户点击率（UCTR），在两种营销区块中分别提升了35.4%和14.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了伪负样本和偏差问题，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale homepage recommendations face critical challenges from
pseudo-negative samples caused by exposure bias, where non-clicks may indicate
inattention rather than disinterest. Existing work lacks thorough analysis of
invalid exposures and typically addresses isolated aspects (e.g., sampling
strategies), overlooking the critical impact of pseudo-positive samples - such
as homepage clicks merely to visit marketing portals. We propose a unified
framework for large-scale homepage recommendation sampling and debiasing. Our
framework consists of two key components: (1) a user intent-aware negative
sampling module to filter invalid exposure samples, and (2) an intent-driven
dual-debiasing module that jointly corrects exposure bias and click bias.
Extensive online experiments on Taobao demonstrate the efficacy of our
framework, achieving significant improvements in user click-through rates
(UCTR) by 35.4\% and 14.5\% in two variants of the marketing block on the
Taobao homepage, Baiyibutie and Taobaomiaosha.

Conclusion: SEARA为特定业务场景提供了一种高效、低成本的检索器评估方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a core approach for enhancing Large
Language Models (LLMs), where the effectiveness of the retriever largely
determines the overall response quality of RAG systems. Retrievers encompass a
multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and
demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter
optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing
evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from
domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling
Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data
challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated
retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive
retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully
automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever
for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG
applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q&A system and
retrieval-based travel assistant, successfully obtaining scenario-specific
optimal retrievers.

Motivation: 研究动机在于填补儿童作为推荐算法用户群体的研究空白，避免因数据集中儿童样本不足而忽视其兴趣。

Method: 方法包括在电影、音乐和书籍领域的数据集上复制和扩展先前研究，并引入流行度偏差指标。

Result: 结果发现儿童与主流用户的消费模式存在差异，且某些差异具有跨领域一致性，而其他则因数据集或领域而异。

Conclusion: 结论指出儿童与推荐算法的互动模式既有普遍性也有特殊性，需进一步研究以优化针对儿童的推荐系统。

Abstract: Children are often exposed to items curated by recommendation algorithms.
Yet, research seldom considers children as a user group, and when it does, it
is anchored on datasets where children are underrepresented, risking
overlooking their interests, favoring those of the majority, i.e., mainstream
users. Recently, Ungruh et al. demonstrated that children's consumption
patterns and preferences differ from those of mainstream users, resulting in
inconsistent recommendation algorithm performance and behavior for this user
group. These findings, however, are based on two datasets with a limited child
user sample. We reproduce and replicate this study on a wider range of datasets
in the movie, music, and book domains, uncovering interaction patterns and
aspects of child-recommender interactions consistent across domains, as well as
those specific to some user samples in the data. We also extend insights from
the original study with popularity bias metrics, given the interpretation of
results from the original study. With this reproduction and extension, we
uncover consumption patterns and differences between age groups stemming from
intrinsic differences between children and others, and those unique to specific
datasets or domains.

Motivation: 现有密集检索方法在处理带有明确时间约束的查询时表现不佳，且现有时间信息检索方法容易导致灾难性遗忘，影响非时间查询的性能。

Method: TSM通过为每个时间指示符训练专门的检索器，并将它们合并为一个统一模型，从而在不影响非时间查询的情况下精确处理时间约束。

Result: 实验表明，TSM在时间约束查询上显著提升性能，同时保持非时间查询的强结果，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: TSM是一种有效的方法，能够同时优化时间约束和非时间查询的信息检索性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital information and knowledge across structured
and unstructured sources has heightened the importance of Information Retrieval
(IR). While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic
matching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with
explicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and
time specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal
Information Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal
queries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a
novel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on
non-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time
specifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of
temporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval. Extensive
experiments on both temporal and non-temporal datasets demonstrate that TSM
significantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while
maintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming
other baseline methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着平台扩展到数十或数百个场景，统一训练所有域会导致性能下降，现有域分组方法无法捕捉真实的转移关系。

Method: CDC通过孤立域亲和矩阵和混合域亲和矩阵建模域转移模式，并引入因果发现计算凝聚力系数，动态优化域聚类和源域选择。

Result: 在公开数据集和工业场景中，CDC显著提升了50多个域的性能，在线eCPM提高了4.9%。

Conclusion: CDC有效解决了多域推荐中的域分组问题，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Multi-domain recommendation leverages domain-general knowledge to improve
recommendations across several domains. However, as platforms expand to dozens
or hundreds of scenarios, training all domains in a unified model leads to
performance degradation due to significant inter-domain differences. Existing
domain grouping methods, based on business logic or data similarities, often
fail to capture the true transfer relationships required for optimal grouping.
To effectively cluster domains, we propose Causal Domain Clustering (CDC). CDC
models domain transfer patterns within a large number of domains using two
distinct effects: the Isolated Domain Affinity Matrix for modeling
non-interactive domain transfers, and the Hybrid Domain Affinity Matrix for
considering dynamic domain synergy or interference under joint training. To
integrate these two transfer effects, we introduce causal discovery to
calculate a cohesion-based coefficient that adaptively balances their
contributions. A Co-Optimized Dynamic Clustering algorithm iteratively
optimizes target domain clustering and source domain selection for training.
CDC significantly enhances performance across over 50 domains on public
datasets and in industrial settings, achieving a 4.9% increase in online eCPM.

Result: 在三个数据集上，剪枝后模型保留了88%的性能，同时减少了95%的非嵌入参数。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了资源需求，同时未大幅影响推荐质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: LLM-based recommender systems have made significant progress; however, the
deployment cost associated with the large parameter volume of LLMs still
hinders their real-world applications. This work explores parameter pruning to
improve parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby
enabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on
inter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components
such as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a
more fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and
layer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy
that progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the
model, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.
Each stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation
techniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter
efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:
across three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original
model's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding
parameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly
reduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation
quality. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/zheng-sl/PruneRec

Abstract: Non-autonomous differential equations are crucial for modeling systems
influenced by external signals, yet fitting these models to data becomes
particularly challenging when the signals change abruptly. To address this
problem, we propose a novel parameter estimation method utilizing functional
approximations with artificial neural networks. Our approach, termed Harmonic
Approximation of Discontinuous External Signals using Neural Networks
(HADES-NN), operates in two iterated stages. In the first stage, the algorithm
employs a neural network to approximate the discontinuous signal with a smooth
function. In the second stage, it uses this smooth approximate signal to
estimate model parameters. HADES-NN gives highly accurate and precise parameter
estimates across various applications, including circadian clock systems
regulated by external light inputs measured via wearable devices and the mating
response of yeast to external pheromone signals. HADES-NN greatly extends the
range of model systems that can be fit to real-world measurements.

Result: 在模拟实验中，SEA-DBS表现出更快的收敛速度、更强的病理信号抑制能力，并支持资源受限的硬件部署。

Conclusion: SEA-DBS为实时、资源受限的自适应神经调控提供了一种实用且有效的RL框架。

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic
simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster
convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and
resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS
offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,
resource-constrained neuromodulation.

Abstract: We present SymFlux, a novel deep learning framework that performs symbolic
regression to identify Hamiltonian functions from their corresponding vector
fields on the standard symplectic plane. SymFlux models utilize hybrid CNN-LSTM
architectures to learn and output the symbolic mathematical expression of the
underlying Hamiltonian. Training and validation are conducted on newly
developed datasets of Hamiltonian vector fields, a key contribution of this
work. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately
recovering these symbolic expressions, advancing automated discovery in
Hamiltonian mechanics.

TL;DR: 论文提出DecoyDB数据集和定制化GCL框架，用于蛋白质-配体复合物的自监督学习，显著提升预测精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测缺乏大规模高质量标记数据，现有数据集如PDBbind规模有限。

Method: 构建DecoyDB数据集（包含真实复合物和多样化的负样本），并设计定制化GCL框架进行预训练和微调。

Result: 实验表明，基于DecoyDB预训练的模型在精度、标记效率和泛化能力上表现优越。

Conclusion: DecoyDB和定制化GCL框架为蛋白质-配体复合物的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital
role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack
of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used
PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,
especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to
break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast
unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.
However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a
comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex
pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique
characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a
large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised
GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground
truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with
computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal
(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation
(RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to
pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with
labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with
DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.

Motivation: 探索线性卷积网络在梯度流下的几何行为，特别是与初始化条件无关的性质。

Method: 分析了参数空间的梯度流如何转化为函数空间的黎曼梯度流，适用于多维卷积（D≥2）和一维卷积（步长大于1）。

Result: 证明了梯度流在函数空间的黎曼表示与初始化无关，且适用于多种卷积条件。

Conclusion: 为理解线性卷积网络的优化行为提供了新的几何视角，扩展了现有理论。

Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear
convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown
recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written
as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight
matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition.
We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear
convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function
space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional
convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides
of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric
depends on the initialization.

TL;DR: WINGs框架通过动态生成权重和压缩CNN权重，显著减少内存需求，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂神经网络存储大量权重所需内存的问题，适用于资源受限的边缘应用。

Method: 使用PCA降维和轻量级SVR模型预测FC网络权重，结合敏感性分析压缩CNN权重。

Result: FC层压缩53倍，AlexNet在MNIST上压缩28倍，CIFAR-10上压缩18倍，精度损失1-2%。

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提高吞吐量并减少能耗，适用于边缘计算。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Result: 揭示了低维潜在动态的成因，并展示了多任务训练中目标对齐的测量方法。

Conclusion: 为非线性循环模型的梯度下降学习提供了新的理论工具和实现（KPFlow）。

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Motivation: 随着无线ECG系统在健康监测和身份验证中的普及，保护信号完整性免受篡改变得至关重要。

Method: 将一维ECG信号通过连续小波变换（CWT）转换为二维时频表示，并使用CNN、ResNet、混合Transformer-CNN及Siamese网络进行训练和评估。

Result: 在高度碎片化的篡改场景中，模型准确率超过99.5%；在细微篡改中，FeatCNN-TranCNN模型平均准确率为98%。身份验证中，混合CNN-Transformer Siamese模型达到100%准确率。

Conclusion: 混合Transformer-CNN和Siamese网络在ECG篡改检测和身份验证中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health
monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is
becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,
ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also
evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity
verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment
substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.
The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional
representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54
subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings
while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental
results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,
FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding
99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent
from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B
substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable
performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity
verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy
of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model
delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KnowRare是一个基于领域适应的深度学习框架，用于预测ICU中罕见疾病的临床结果，解决了数据稀缺和异质性问题，并在多项任务中优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中罕见疾病由于数据稀缺和异质性未得到充分关注，需要一种新方法来支持临床决策。

Method: 通过自监督预训练学习条件无关表示，并利用条件知识图从临床相似条件中选择性迁移知识。

Result: 在五项临床预测任务中表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统，并展示了灵活性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: KnowRare是支持ICU罕见疾病临床决策的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号易受伪迹干扰，影响自动睡眠分期的准确性，需要一种可靠的方法来检测和排除这些伪迹。

Method: 开发了eegUsability机器学习模型，基于手动标记的EEG数据进行训练和评估，并集成到eegFloss工具包中。

Result: eegUsability表现出色（F1分数约0.85，Cohen's kappa为0.78），能高效识别可用EEG数据（召回率约94%）。

Conclusion: eegFloss通过检测伪迹提升了睡眠研究的分析精度和结果可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性工作提供了概念验证，激励进一步探索预测未见模型行为的方法。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their
internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first
automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically
grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on
sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of
thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to
diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron
activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,
enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and
instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,
including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that
analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws
and a structured neuron space distribution.

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine
learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to
larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main
algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant
challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial
dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for
the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;
here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this
study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.
Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing
operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,
combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the
information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and
expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be
implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of
unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to
real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one
order of magnitude.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SignSoftSGD（S3）的新型优化器，通过改进Adam的更新机制，增强了性能并减少了训练中的不稳定现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam在训练深度神经网络中表现优异，但其成功机制和局限性尚未充分探索，尤其是其对梯度波动的处理能力和更新不稳定性。

Method: S3通过引入灵活的p阶动量、统一的EMA系数和Nesterov加速模块，改进了Adam的更新机制。

Result: S3在非凸随机优化中达到最优收敛率，实验显示其收敛更快、性能更好且更稳定。

Conclusion: S3在效率和最终任务性能上均优于AdamW，尤其在处理大学习率时表现突出。

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but
the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain
underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam
stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large
gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes
due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and
mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with
three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by
employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator,
departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)
preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving
stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3
minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving
average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently
bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3
incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,
accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that
S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic
optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of
vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more
rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even
with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers
performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the
training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task
performance.

TL;DR: FMSP利用基础模型的代码生成能力和广泛知识，通过跨越策略空间的局部最优解，改进自博弈算法，提出三种方法：vFMSP、NSSP和QDSP，并在Car Tag和Gandalf实验中验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈算法（SP）常因陷入局部最优解而无法生成多样化的策略，FMSP旨在利用基础模型解决这一问题。

Method: 提出三种FMSP方法：vFMSP（持续优化策略）、NSSP（生成多样化策略）和QDSP（结合多样性与高质量策略）。

Result: 在Car Tag中，FMSP探索多种方法并超越人工策略；在Gandalf中，成功突破LLM防御并自动修复漏洞。

Conclusion: FMSP为自博弈算法提供了新方向，推动了更具创造性和开放性的策略发现。

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud
detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node
representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the
focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global
topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being
overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign
nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class
imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of
imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior
obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,
we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate
Message imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a
topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation
learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient
propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust
node representations, enhancing the stable association between node
representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.
Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the
results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud
detection.

Abstract: Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across
participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this
paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across
multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this
paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning
paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during
federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion
representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel
diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation
Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion
models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven
diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to
provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence
signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the
diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive
learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency
regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising
representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In
addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying
on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to
ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different
scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在预训练-微调范式中未能同时建模时间和频率特征，导致复杂时间序列预测性能不佳。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试中，MoFE-Time表现最佳，MSE和MAE分别降低6.95%和6.02%。

Conclusion: MoFE-Time在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal
role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture
for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing
models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency
characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal
performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling
periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an
innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency
domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the
pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively
transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets
with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency
and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing
mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input
signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared
to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation
benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from
real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this
dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical
commercial applications.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持单调性的同时，兼具表达能力、鲁棒性和可解释性，为概率校准提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated probability estimates,
leading to overconfident predictions. A common approach for calibration is
fitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms
predicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is
instance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability
outputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee
monotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized
calibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural
networks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose
a family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a
constrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number
of classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and
interpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability
output by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained
optimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance
across datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming
existing calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient. Our

Conclusion: AdaDPIGU通过自适应稀疏化同时提升隐私性和实用性，适用于高维深度学习任务。

Abstract: Differential privacy has been proven effective for stochastic gradient
descent; however, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in
high-dimensional settings, as the scale of injected noise increases with
dimensionality. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new
differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates
tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a
differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each
parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune
low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping
mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically,
we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy
and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported
under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test
accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching
the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at
$\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating
that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate
hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying
function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a
novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model
and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and
acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our
framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying
hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an
acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a
Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing
multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision
transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving
the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning
paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated
data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real
evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO
baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust
exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

Conclusion: CircuitGCL通过结合表示散射和标签重平衡，显著提升了AMS电路图的表示学习效果，为下游任务提供了更鲁棒和可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is
crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the
scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the
inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to
learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these
limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning
framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to
enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs
a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through
hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale
data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax
cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution
disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic
estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and
ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS
designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the
$R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score
gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is

Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from
graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However,
training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the
scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present
CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS
circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the
coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link
prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a
small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph.
Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer.
Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that
summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph.
CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and
reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to
existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling
direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.
Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models
for representation learning.

Conclusion: 挑战了去中心化学习在数据异构和通信受限下泛化差的传统观点，为模型合并和损失景观提供新见解。

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional
parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by
limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication
should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently
devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating
communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly
improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected
communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is
sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show
that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the
\textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical
contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the
globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized
mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy
among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as
constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the
common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data
heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model
merging and neural network loss landscapes.

Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized.
The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and
post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design
parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the
parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware
pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage
model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model
combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in
SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant
internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to
abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM
designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in
parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also
significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

Motivation: 谱初始化方法虽然提升了LoRA的性能和收敛性，但其额外的计算和存储开销影响了效率。本文旨在通过更新幅度驱动的方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出LoRAM，一种基于幅度驱动的“基与基”初始化方案，通过预训练权重幅度缩放确定性正交基来模拟谱增益。

Result: 实验表明，LoRAM在保持LoRA高效性的同时，性能与谱初始化相当或更优。

Conclusion: 更新幅度是LoRA性能的关键驱动因素，LoRAM提供了一种高效且性能优越的初始化策略。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning
large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence
and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra
computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we
establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and
propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that
matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions
are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove
low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying
hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as
mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization
succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed
knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the
boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization
strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight
magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM
serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while
matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备上的存储和延迟问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input.
However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a
significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we
consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: LPPO框架通过样本中心视角优化强化学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work
has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we
investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO
(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive
optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best
leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than
simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human
problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation
method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations
to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired
by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current
capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that
adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We
estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of
per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and
de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster
convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine

Conclusion: 该框架通过提升泛化能力和可扩展性，为AI驱动的6G RAN提供了一种通用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where
hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass
such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and
unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges.
Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading
performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a
generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell
topology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii)
applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii)
distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training
in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although
generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our
distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training
across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five
5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency
by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and
by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic
and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks,
respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput
over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture,
offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

Conclusion: 新框架在解缠和生成质量上表现优异，支持潜在空间的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

*Jinmin He,Kai Li,Yifan Zang,Haobo Fu,Qiang Fu,Junliang Xing,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTPG的新框架，通过跨任务策略指导加速技能学习，并结合门控机制提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注参数共享，但忽略了直接利用跨任务相似性，即已掌握任务的策略可以为未掌握任务提供指导。

Method: CTPG为每个任务训练一个指导策略，从所有任务的控制策略中选择行为策略，并引入两种门控机制优化学习效率。

Result: 实验表明，CTPG与现有参数共享方法结合后，在操作和运动基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CTPG是一种通用框架，能有效利用跨任务相似性，提升多任务强化学习性能。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared
information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with
carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures.
However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task
similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills
can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills
acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy
Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the
behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control
policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two
gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters
out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate
blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework
adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly
enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 医疗图像分类中数据泄露是关键问题，现有方法在小型不平衡数据集（如HAM10000）上效果不佳，导致模型陷入次优解。

Method: 提出SAD-DPSGD方法，采用线性衰减机制动态调整噪声和裁剪阈值，初始阶段分配更多隐私预算和更高裁剪阈值。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集上，SAD-DPSGD比Auto-DPSGD准确率提高2.15%（ε=3.0，δ=10^-3）。

Conclusion: SAD-DPSGD有效解决不平衡数据集上的隐私保护问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: When applying machine learning to medical image classification, data leakage
is a critical issue. Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for
differential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but
fail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the
imbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped
and lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate. This leads the
model to fall into suboptimal solutions early. To address this, we propose
SAD-DPSGD, which uses a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping
thresholds. By allocating more privacy budget and using higher clipping
thresholds in the initial training phases, the model avoids suboptimal
solutions and enhances performance. Experiments show that SAD-DPSGD outperforms
Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, improving accuracy by 2.15% under $\epsilon = 3.0$ ,
$\delta = 10^{-3}$.

Motivation: 传统异常检测方法需要针对不同数据集进行超参数调优和模型训练，过程繁琐且成本高。UniOD旨在通过单一模型解决多领域异常检测问题，提高效率和准确性。

Method: UniOD将每个数据集转换为多个图，生成一致的节点特征，并将异常检测任务转化为节点分类问题，从而实现对未见领域的泛化。

Conclusion: UniOD避免了模型选择和超参数调优的麻烦，降低了计算成本，并有效利用历史数据集的知识，提高了实际应用的便利性和准确性。

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) seeks to distinguish inliers and outliers in
completely unlabeled datasets and plays a vital role in science and
engineering. Most existing OD methods require troublesome dataset-specific
hyperparameter tuning and costly model training before they can be deployed to
identify outliers. In this work, we propose UniOD, a universal OD framework
that leverages labeled datasets to train a single model capable of detecting
outliers of datasets from diverse domains. Specifically, UniOD converts each
dataset into multiple graphs, produces consistent node features, and frames
outlier detection as a node-classification task, and is able to generalize to
unseen domains. As a result, UniOD avoids effort on model selection and
hyperparameter tuning, reduces computational cost, and effectively utilizes the
knowledge from historical datasets, which improves the convenience and accuracy
in real applications. We evaluate UniOD on 15 benchmark OD datasets against 15
state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: GO-Skill通过技能抽象和分层策略学习，显著提升了离线多任务强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy
capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets,
without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it
faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks.
Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we
propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed
to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task
performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented
skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a
discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable
and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the
extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical
policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that
dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks.
Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the
MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了过拟合，并通过拉普拉斯算子在交错网格上的应用提供了替代测试指标。

Abstract: This document reports on a method for detecting and preventing overfitting on
data regressions, herein applied to mesh-like data structures. The mesh
structure allows for the straightforward computation of the Laplace-operator
second-order derivatives in a finite-difference fashion for noiseless data.
Derivatives of the training data are computed on the original training mesh to
serve as a true label of the entropy of the training data. Derivatives of the
trained data are computed on a staggered mesh to identify oscillations in the
interior of the original training mesh cells. The loss of the Laplace-operator
derivatives is used for hyperparameter optimisation, achieving a reduction of
unwanted oscillation through the minimisation of the entropy of the trained
model. In this setup, testing does not require the splitting of points from the
training data, and training is thus directly performed on all available
training points. The Laplace operator applied to the trained data on a
staggered mesh serves as a surrogate testing metric based on diffusion
properties.

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention
in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we
concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown
promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental,
confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has
primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for
covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely
disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal
relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that
incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear
orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and
simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting
techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and
real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on
individual treatment effects.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems are a way to allow machines, systems and frameworks to deal
with uncertainty, which is not possible in binary systems that most computers
use. These systems have already been deployed for certain use cases, and fuzzy
systems could be further improved as proposed in this paper. Such technologies
to draw inspiration from include machine learning and federated learning.
Machine learning is one of the recent breakthroughs of technology and could be
applied to fuzzy systems to further improve the results it produces. Federated
learning is also one of the recent technologies that have huge potential, which
allows machine learning training to improve by reducing privacy risk, reducing
burden on networking infrastructure, and reducing latency of the latest model.
Aspects from federated learning could be used to improve federated learning,
such as applying the idea of updating the fuzzy rules that make up a key part
of fuzzy systems, to further improve it over time. This paper discusses how
these improvements would be implemented in fuzzy systems, and how it would
improve fuzzy systems. It also discusses certain limitations on the potential
improvements. It concludes that these proposed ideas and improvements require
further investigation to see how far the improvements are, but the potential is
there to improve fuzzy systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于异构图注意力网络的电力系统状态预测方法，显著优于传统基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统因可再生能源和分布式能源的引入而变得复杂，需要准确预测短期状态以确保稳定运行。

Method: 使用异构图注意力网络（Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks）建模传感器数据的同质和异质关系，特别是液压和电气两个物理域的数据。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在归一化均方根误差上平均优于传统基线35.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多域、多速率电力系统状态预测中表现出色，为复杂系统的建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable
operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing
variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these
systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict
their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control
decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.
Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges
for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state
forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor
networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate
information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are
designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are
typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts
their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly
encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy
conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous
Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both
homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among
sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -
which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on
average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its
effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

Result: 通过全面评估，揭示了不同数据分布与算法适用性的关系，并指出了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒和实用的IfO技术提供了重要见解，推动了可扩展行为学习的发展。

Abstract: Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn
behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement
learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the
need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However,
current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality
data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast,
this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to
learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning
can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based
imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to
transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and
the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established
methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.

Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in
control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy
measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive
Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state
estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers,
which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed
framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a
physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal
gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system
states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence
guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error
minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs
is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear
systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and
benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing
observer designs highlight its superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving
differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained
by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while
model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This
physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex
parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for
physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.

Abstract: This document proposes a parametric activation function (ac.f.) aimed at
improving multidimensional nonlinear data regression. It is a established
knowledge that nonlinear ac.f.'s are required for learning nonlinear datasets.
This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further
impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and
sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f.'s such as
ELU or SiLU have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f.'s such as RELU and
Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved
performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with
non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also
proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of
overfitting.

Conclusion: 通过轨迹稳定性框架，论文提供了不依赖复杂信息论项的拓扑泛化界，并验证了TDA项的实际重要性。

Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms is
a major challenge in modern learning theory. Recently, several studies
highlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the
generalization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a
series of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the
generalization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from
topological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds
rely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in
specific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),
potentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we
seek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization
bounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce
a novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies
via proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing
notion of \textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \textit{trajectory stability},
we prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be
upper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the
trajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory
stability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental
evaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great
importance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately
forms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization
bounds.

Abstract: This article introduces an imitation learning method for learning maximum
entropy policies that comply with constraints demonstrated by expert
trajectories executing a task. The formulation of the method takes advantage of
results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between
demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified
through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement
learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective
to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed
algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent,
supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed
method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in
settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different
modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches
for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone
parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our
method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during
standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based
merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation
scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an
explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing
update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless
integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective
model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals,
establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code

Abstract: Prototype models are an important method for explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) and interpretable machine learning. In this paper, we
perform an in-depth analysis of a set of prominent prototype models including
ProtoPNet, ProtoPool and PIPNet. For their assessment, we apply a comprehensive
set of metrics. In addition to applying standard metrics from literature, we
propose several new metrics to further complement the analysis of model
interpretability. In our experimentation, we apply the set of prototype models
on a diverse set of datasets including fine-grained classification, Non-IID
settings and multi-label classification to further contrast the performance.
Furthermore, we also provide our code as an open-source library, which
facilitates simple application of the metrics itself, as well as extensibility
- providing the option for easily adding new metrics and models.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别在HCI中日益重要，但现有方法在多模态异质性挖掘和标签相关性利用上存在不足。

Method: 采用跨注意力融合生理数据，设计基于最优传输的异质性挖掘模块，引入可学习标签嵌入和标签相关性驱动的跨注意力机制。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: HeLo框架在多模态情感分布学习中表现出色，有效解决了异质性挖掘和标签相关性利用的挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays
a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since
different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with
single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that
identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.
However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among
multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic
emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring
the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data
and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt
cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal
transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the
interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral
representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a
learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,
the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated
with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven
cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出ReMix方法，通过混合策略和策略重生技术，将离线策略数据用于在线强化学习微调，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线强化学习微调方法未能充分利用历史数据，导致计算和时间成本高昂，限制了模型的经济高效扩展。

Method: ReMix结合混合策略近端策略梯度、KL凸约束和策略重生技术，实现高效训练和稳定改进。

Result: 实验显示ReMix在多个数学推理基准上表现优异，训练成本降低30至450倍。

Conclusion: ReMix为强化学习微调提供了一种高效且经济的方法，同时揭示了离线策略数据对模型行为的影响。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

Motivation: 高斯过程在不确定性感知函数逼近和序列决策中很强大，但传统方法难以适应大规模数据和现代硬件并行计算的需求。

Method: 通过将迭代线性系统求解器与路径条件化结合，将昂贵计算转化为线性方程组的求解，降低内存需求。

Result: 显著减少了内存需求，适用于更大规模数据，并优化了现代硬件的矩阵乘法操作。

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程在现代大规模计算环境中的应用提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a powerful framework for uncertainty-aware function
approximation and sequential decision-making. Unfortunately, their classical
formulation does not scale gracefully to large amounts of data and modern
hardware for massively-parallel computation, prompting many researchers to
develop techniques which improve their scalability. This dissertation focuses
on the powerful combination of iterative methods and pathwise conditioning to
develop methodological contributions which facilitate the use of Gaussian
processes in modern large-scale settings. By combining these two techniques
synergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems
of linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.
This drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to
significantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as
the main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.

Conclusion: DiffSpectra首次统一了多模态光谱推理和2D/3D生成建模，为分子结构解析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

Result: 算法在T次迭代中实现次线性遗憾，并在特定情况下提供改进的遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 框架为动态资源分配问题提供了新的理论支持，尤其在多上下文场景中表现优越。

Abstract: We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with
contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These
episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability
distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same
latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a
request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications
such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment,
and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets.
We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the
number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that
achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing
contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with
arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning
problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret
bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data,
which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.

Motivation: 现有联邦因果发现方法主要针对水平联邦设置，但在实际中，不同客户端可能包含不同变量，导致虚假因果关系。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据实验中，该方法表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在水平和垂直联邦设置下均能有效学习因果结构，解决了变量不完整问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between
entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and
numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal
structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings.
However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain
data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables
can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the
information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we
comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both
horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification
theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and
vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first
aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to
construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for
recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength
matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but
also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm
demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic
data and real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据流的高速度、无界性和复杂依赖性对处理技术提出挑战，固定窗口难以适应动态变化。

Method: 将窗口大小选择建模为强化学习问题，使用Dueling DQN和优先经验回放，学习自适应策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，RL-Window在分类精度、漂移鲁棒性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RL-Window具有适应性和稳定性，适用于实时应用，并通过扩展指标验证了其优势。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial
markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high
velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding
window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size
windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty
patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based
approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional
data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable
an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as
variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a
Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle
non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
(UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms
state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification
accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional
qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and
a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and
stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Result: 实验表明，NVML框架显著提升了交通标志识别系统在对抗条件下的鲁棒性和安全性。

Conclusion: NVML框架为自动驾驶中的交通标志识别提供了一种有效的安全增强方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is rapidly advancing as a key application of machine
learning, yet ensuring the safety of these systems remains a critical
challenge. Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous
vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML)
framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our
approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential
safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs.
We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various
voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the
robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial
conditions.

Motivation: 去中心化学习虽然能分布数据和计算负载，但缺乏公平的激励机制，阻碍了参与积极性。

Result: DICE能有效估计影响力级联，并支持选择合适合作者和识别恶意行为。

Conclusion: DICE为去中心化网络中的公平激励提供了理论基础和应用支持。

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data
consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed
compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the
exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in
absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair
incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to
participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the
localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network.
To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized
environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of
influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence
cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the
curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications
including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

Conclusion: 基础模型可能仅发展出任务特定的启发式方法，缺乏泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.

Result: 证明了网络参数规模需满足特定条件才能实现低于噪声方差的经验风险，并通过HJB PDE案例验证。

Conclusion: 研究为定量理解噪声环境下PINNs训练的参数需求奠定了基础。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate
solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high
dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is
important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.
However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so
effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for
the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy
supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk
$O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily
$d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$
is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies
to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled
noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone
does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show
empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$
under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for
quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in
the presence of noise.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary
(including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp
accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在处理多视图时存在优化冲突、交互建模不足、对齐-均匀性耦合等问题，无法充分利用多视图的优势。

Method: 提出MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL两种损失函数，分别通过同时建模所有视图交互和解耦对齐与均匀性来优化多视图对比学习。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上，新方法显著优于现有多视图方法，并能扩展到多模态数据。MV-DHEL在五视图以上时有效缓解维度崩溃。

Conclusion: 新方法为多视图对比学习提供了理论支持和实际改进，尤其在视图数量增加时表现优异。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

Result: 在开源EHR数据集上验证，RawMed在保真度和实用性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RawMed是首个能生成接近原始EHR的合成数据框架，为医疗研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at

Abstract: Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently
attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high
variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as
inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved
questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate
the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for
deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze
the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and
their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact
Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler
and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings
allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.

TL;DR: PLAME是一种新型的MSA设计模型，利用预训练蛋白质语言模型的进化嵌入，解决了低同源性和孤儿蛋白质的预测问题，显著提升了AlphaFold2和AlphaFold3的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构预测模型依赖多序列比对（MSA），但在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质中MSA信息稀疏或缺失，限制了预测效果。PLAME旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PLAME引入预训练表示增强进化信息，采用保守性-多样性损失提升生成质量，并提出新的MSA筛选方法和序列质量评估指标。

Result: 在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质的AlphaFold2基准测试中，PLAME在折叠增强和序列质量评估上达到最优性能，并在AlphaFold3上表现一致提升。

Conclusion: PLAME通过创新方法显著提升了蛋白质结构预测性能，尤其在MSA信息稀缺的情况下，同时可作为适配器结合ESMFold的速度与AlphaFold2的精度。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

Motivation: 探索自监督学习（SSL）在资源受限的边缘设备上的可行性和效率，解决数据量大和计算资源需求高的问题。

Method: 分析不同SSL技术在有限计算、数据和能源预算下的适应性，评估其在资源受限环境中学习鲁棒表示的效果，并考虑半监督学习降低标注能耗。

Result: 定制SSL策略在性能接近传统方法的同时，资源消耗降低高达4倍。

Conclusion: SSL技术适合边缘设备的高效能学习，尤其在资源受限场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to
traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich
representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more
broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of
data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and
efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs
between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how
different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy
budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations
under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy
costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may
assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve
competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X,
underscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于集成嵌入的语义缓存方法，通过结合多个嵌入模型提升LLM系统中语义相似性检测的效果，显著优于单模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存框架依赖单一嵌入模型，难以捕捉真实查询中的多样语义关系，限制了缓存效率。

Method: 采用集成嵌入方法，通过训练元编码器结合多个嵌入模型，提升语义相似性检测能力。

Result: 在QQP数据集上，实现了92%的缓存命中率和85%的非等价查询拒绝准确率，显著优于单模型方法。

Conclusion: 集成嵌入方法能更有效区分语义相似与不相似查询，提升LLM系统的缓存性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM)
systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once,
and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic
caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,
which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships
present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble
embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained
meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.
We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring
cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our
ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent
queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting
non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble
embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in
distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to
more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in
LLM-based systems.

Motivation: 解决DIL中因类不平衡和跨域分布偏移导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 提出DCE框架，包括频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器，分别处理类内不平衡和跨域知识迁移。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DCE有效解决了DIL中的关键挑战，提升了模型在非平稳环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了小批量训练语言模型的稳定性，提出了一种调整Adam超参数的方法，并发现小批量训练在多方面优于大批量训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为小批量训练不稳定，但本文挑战这一观点，探索小批量训练的优势。

Method: 提出一种调整Adam超参数以适应小批量训练的规则，并验证小批量训练的稳定性。

Result: 小批量训练稳定、对超参数更鲁棒、性能更优，且支持SGD训练。

Conclusion: 建议选择小批量训练，避免梯度累积，除非在多设备训练中带宽受限。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model
pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which
trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch
size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,
other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small
batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for
scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch
sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter
choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch
sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,
even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these
results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and
setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient
accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas,
bottlenecked by inter-device bandwidth.

Motivation: 探讨当代视觉模型是否具备组合理解能力，以及数据规模和多样性对组合泛化的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验系统变化数据规模、概念多样性和组合覆盖率，评估预训练模型（DINO、CLIP）。

Result: 组合泛化依赖数据多样性，线性分解表示结构能实现高效泛化，预训练模型表现部分符合。

Conclusion: 强调构建多样化数据集的重要性，以及高效组合学习的表示结构设计。

Abstract: Compositional understanding is crucial for human intelligence, yet it remains
unclear whether contemporary vision models exhibit it. The dominant machine
learning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes
will improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional
generalization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that
systematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We
find that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere
data scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a
linearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into
additive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling
perfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained
models (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting
partial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on
constructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering
the importance of representational structure that enables efficient
compositional learning. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络DPD在宽频RF功率放大器中参数多、能耗高的问题。

Method: 提出TRes-DeltaGRU算法，结合定点量化和动态时间稀疏性优化模型。

Result: 32位浮点模型ACPR为-59.4 dBc，EVM为-42.1 dBc；优化后能耗降低4.5倍，性能仍保持较高水平。

Conclusion: OpenDPDv2在降低能耗的同时保持了高性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based Digital Predistortion (DPD) stands out in improving
signal quality in wideband radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs)
employing complex modulation. However, NN DPDs usually rely on a large number
of parameters for effective linearization and can significantly contribute to
the energy consumption of the digital back-end in RF systems. This paper
presents OpenDPDv2, a unified framework for PA modeling, DPD learning, and
model optimization to reduce power consumption while maintaining high
linearization performance. The optimization techniques feature a novel DPD
algorithm, TRes-DeltaGRU, alongside two energy-efficient methods. The
top-performing 32-bit floating-point (FP32) TRes-DeltaGRU-DPD model achieves an
Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -59.4 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude
(EVM) of -42.1 dBc. By exploiting fixed-point quantization and dynamic temporal
sparsity of input signals and hidden neurons, the inference energy of our model
can be reduced by 4.5X while still maintaining -50.3 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM
with 56% temporal sparsity. This was evaluated using a TM3.1a 200 MHz bandwidth
256-QAM OFDM signal applied to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA. OpenDPDv2 code,

Motivation: 在超5G网络中，多蜂窝网络面临窃听者威胁，需要提升物理层安全性以保护合法用户的机密信息。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架下的多智能体强化学习（MARL），每个基站作为DRL智能体，使用DQN和RDPG两种方法优化保密速率。

Result: RDPG比DQN收敛更快，且性能优于分布式DRL方法，同时揭示了安全性与复杂性的权衡。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架下的MARL策略能有效提升物理层安全性，RDPG是更优选择，但需权衡安全与复杂性。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS)
in a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each
cell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent
that interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of
legitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts
to intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its
authorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only
share their network parameters with a central server and not the private data
of their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and
Reinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results
demonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach.
Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and
complexity.

Conclusion: 数字孪生和模拟到现实策略的结合为解决电信领域数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is
challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data
collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the
unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network
environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as
simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate
site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there
is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality
(sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews
recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital
twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real
gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between
digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two
conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the
level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training
loss via prediction-powered inference.

Conclusion: 本文为非渐近收敛分析在隐私保护优化问题中的应用奠定了基础，并为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has been widely
used for solving optimization problems with privacy guarantees in machine
learning and statistics. Despite this, a systematic non-asymptotic convergence
analysis for DP-SGD, particularly in the context of online problems and local
differential privacy (LDP) models, remains largely elusive. Existing
non-asymptotic analyses have focused on non-private optimization methods, and
hence are not applicable to privacy-preserving optimization problems. This work
initiates the analysis to bridge this gap and opens the door to non-asymptotic
convergence analysis of private optimization problems. A general framework is
investigated for the online LDP model in stochastic optimization problems. We
assume that sensitive information from individuals is collected sequentially
and aim to estimate, in real-time, a static parameter that pertains to the
population of interest. Most importantly, we conduct a comprehensive
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the proposed estimators in finite-sample
situations, which gives their users practical guidelines regarding the effect
of various hyperparameters, such as step size, parameter dimensions, and
privacy budgets, on convergence rates. Our proposed estimators are validated in
the theoretical and practical realms by rigorous mathematical derivations and
carefully constructed numerical experiments.

Motivation: 传统模型将海冰与南极冰架视为独立系统，无法捕捉局部联系与级联反馈，因此需要一种新方法来研究海冰退缩对冰架融化的直接影响。

Conclusion: Spatial-Link为改进海平面上升预测和气候适应策略提供了可扩展的数据驱动工具。

Abstract: Spatial phenomena often exhibit heterogeneity across spatial extents and in
proximity, making them complex to model-especially in dynamic regions like ice
shelves and sea ice. In this study, we address this challenge by exploring the
linkages between sea ice retreat and Antarctic ice shelf (AIS) melt. Although
atmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct
impact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional
models treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to
capture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose
Spatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial
heterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our
method constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of
satellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of
significant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We
extract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and
Monte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous
coupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream
AIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid
and progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage. To our
knowledge, this is the first proposed methodology linking sea ice retreat to
AIS melt. Spatial-Link offers a scalable, data-driven tool to improve sea-level
rise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies.

Result: 发现某些声音通过调整基频和共振峰频率可达到“可爱峰值”，但存在上限效应。

Conclusion: 初步验证了可爱声音模型，并提供了调整计算机声音可爱度的基本方法。

Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural
connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet,
virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including
in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the
new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to
kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We
conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer
voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet
spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only
for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling
effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation
of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for

Motivation: 探索动漫风格语音代理如何通过不同语音风格和情感语调影响用户交互，特别是在语言学习和文化背景差异下。

Method: 采用混合方法评估54名参与者与基于大语言模型和文本转语音合成的动漫风格代理的交互，分析用户参与度、感知可用性、情感反应和学习行为。

Result: 代理的声音、人设和语言风格显著影响用户体验、动机和学习策略，尤其在语言水平和文化背景差异下。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更具吸引力和社交响应性的代理系统提供了指导，丰富了人机交互中情感和文化风格代理的理解。

Abstract: This study investigates how stylized, voiced agents shape user interaction in
a multimodal language learning environment. We conducted a mixed-methods
evaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters
powered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These
agents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,
semi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We
analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,
and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization
influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural
backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,
and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and
strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally
stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing
more engaging, socially responsive systems.

Motivation: 平台减少内容审核投入，CSOs具备专业知识和情境理解，应成为技术开发的主动参与者而非被动消费者。

Method: 与CSO合作开发AI辅助的开源监测工具，用于Telegram上的反民主运动监测。

Result: 目前为进行中的工作，尚未有具体成果。

Conclusion: CSOs应积极参与技术开发，以确保工具符合需求和价值观，但目前此类合作仍较少。

Abstract: The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online
content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their
investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and
monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer
seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures.
Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content,
CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing
feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder
needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations
between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and
research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by
civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be
meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of
anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in
collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为实时自适应池化（RAP）的新方法，解决了深度学习在实时脑机接口（BCI）应用中的三大挑战：离线到在线的转换、计算复杂性和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在离线BCI中表现优异，但在实时应用中面临三大挑战：离线模型难以直接用于在线解码、滑动窗口增加计算负担、数据需求大。

Method: 引入RAP方法，通过修改现有离线模型的池化层来适应在线解码需求，同时利用源自由域适应减少数据需求。

Result: RAP在实时BCI中表现稳健高效，保护隐私、减少校准需求，支持协同自适应系统。

Conclusion: RAP为在线BCI的深度学习应用提供了可行框架，推动了用户中心化高性能BCI的发展。

Abstract: Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due
to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline
decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of
sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational
complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data,
which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and
enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration,
we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method.
RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to
meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity
during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further
alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain
adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of
target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient
framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces
calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for
broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation
for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate
feedback and user learning.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种预测增强的算法框架，用于在非均匀权重的战略代理中平衡一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的无权重设施选址假设所有代理的重要性相同，但在实际场景中可能不成立，因此需要研究加权设施选址问题。

Method: 通过识别代表性实例的子集并将其他位置映射到代表性实例，提出了一种策略证明机制。

Result: 证明了在加权设置下，存在一种策略证明机制，能够实现有界的一致性和鲁棒性保证。

Conclusion: 即使在完全预测所有代理的情况下，加权设施选址问题中也不存在能够同时达到1-一致性和O(n·W_max/W_min)-鲁棒性的策略证明确定性机制。

Abstract: Facility location is fundamental in operations research, mechanism design,
and algorithmic game theory, with applications ranging from urban
infrastructure planning to distributed systems. Recent research in this area
has focused on augmenting classic strategyproof mechanisms with predictions to
achieve an improved performance guarantee against the uncertainty under the
strategic environment. Previous work has been devoted to address the trade-off
obstacle of balancing the consistency (near-optimality under accurate
predictions) and robustness (bounded inefficiency under poor predictions)
primarily in the unweighted setting, assuming that all agents have the same
importance. However, this assumption may not be true in some practical
scenarios, leading to research of weighted facility location problems.
  The major contribution of the current work is to provide a prediction
augmented algorithmic framework for balancing the consistency and robustness
over strategic agents with non-uniform weights. In particular, through a
reduction technique that identifies a subset of \emph{representative} instances
and maps the other given locations to the representative ones, we prove that
there exists a \emph{strategyproof} mechanism achieving a bounded consistency
guarantee of $\frac{\sqrt{(1+c)^2W^2_{\min}+(1-c)^2W^2_{\max}}}{(1+c)W_{\min}}$
and a bounded robustness guarantee of
$\frac{\sqrt{(1-c)^2W^2_{\min}+(1+c)^2W^2_{\max}}}{(1-c)W_{\min}}$ in weighted
settings, where $c$ can be viewed as a parameter to make a trade-off between
the consistency and robustness and $W_{\min}$ and $W_{\max}$ denote the minimum
and maximum agents' weight. We also proved that there is no strategyproof
deterministic mechanism that reach $1$-consistency and $O\left( n \cdot
\frac{W_{\max}}{W_{\min}} \right)$-robustness in weighted FLP, even with fully
predictions of all agents.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经算子和去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）的深度学习框架，用于从极稀疏的拉格朗日观测数据中重建高分辨率海洋状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋动力学的重建受限于观测数据的稀疏性、不规则性和拉格朗日性质，传统方法和深度学习模型在恢复中尺度湍流方面存在困难。

Method: 利用神经算子与DDPMs结合的深度学习框架，通过生成模型在神经算子输出的基础上重建高分辨率海洋状态。

Result: 该方法在合成数据和真实卫星观测中分别达到99%和99.9%的稀疏度下仍能准确捕捉小尺度高波数动态，性能优于其他深度学习基线。

Conclusion: 该框架在严重空间采样限制下表现出鲁棒性，为海洋动力学重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally
limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling,
particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant
challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves.
Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle
to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep
learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from
extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model
on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale,
high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and
$99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on
benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data,
demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as
compared to other deep learning baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解耦推理与证明的新框架，通过两个专门模型分别处理高层推理和低层证明生成，显著提升了自动定理证明的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在非形式推理上表现优异，但在形式证明上表现较差（非形式准确率80% vs. 形式成功率8%），原因是现有证明器将推理与证明紧密耦合，惩罚了深度推理。

Method: 提出了一种解耦框架，使用一个通用的推理器生成多样化的子目标引理，并由一个高效的证明器严格验证这些引理。

Result: 在2000年后IMO问题上，该框架成功解决了5个问题，是首个开源证明器在此类问题上的成功案例。

Conclusion: 解耦设计释放了模型的推理潜力，为自动化解决高难度数学问题提供了新方向，并公开了数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages is a foundational
challenge for AI. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable
progress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning
capabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show
that the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on
benchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current
state-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are
trained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of
shallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a
novel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof
generation. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful,
general-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an
efficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the
model's full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end
training. We evaluate our method on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO
problems, a problem set on which no prior open-source prover has reported
success. Our decoupled framework successfully solves 5 of these problems,
demonstrating a significant step towards automated reasoning on exceptionally
difficult mathematical challenges. To foster future research, we release our
full dataset of generated and verified lemmas for a wide range of IMO problems,
available at https://tencent-imo.github.io/ .

Motivation: 理解物种丰富度的空间尺度依赖性受限于跨尺度生物多样性记录的收集困难。

Method: 结合采样理论和小尺度生态调查，开发深度学习模型预测物种丰富度。

Result: 模型将物种丰富度估计提高了32%，并能解析从平方米到数百平方公里的物种丰富度和周转模式。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效表征生物多样性的多尺度特性，为全球变化下的生物多样性评估和预测提供支持。

Abstract: The number of species within ecosystems is influenced not only by their
intrinsic characteristics but also by the spatial scale considered. As the
sampled area expands, species richness increases, a phenomenon described by the
species-area relationship (SAR). The accumulation dynamics of the SAR results
from a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic processes operating at various
spatial scales. However, the challenge of collecting exhaustive biodiversity
records across spatial scales has hindered a comprehensive understanding of
these dynamics. Here, we develop a deep learning approach that leverages
sampling theory and small-scale ecological surveys to spatially resolve the
scale-dependency of species richness. We demonstrate its performance by
predicting the species richness of vascular plant communities across Europe,
and evaluate the predictions against an independent dataset of plant community
inventories. Our model improves species richness estimates by 32\% and delivers
spatially explicit patterns of species richness and turnover for sampling areas
ranging from square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Explainable AI
techniques further disentangle how drivers of species richness operate across
spatial scales. The ability of our model to represent the multi-scale nature of
biodiversity is essential to deliver robust biodiversity assessments and
forecasts under global change.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in
traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems
that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing
directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable
medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a
Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities,
such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The
Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids,
which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The
heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and
aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of
silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a
unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a
unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by
fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and
healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with
an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation
training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source
and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume
fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to
the changes in the Maxwell parameter.

Motivation: 智能微电网面临网络攻击威胁，现有诊断方法依赖昂贵设备或严格模型假设，难以在单传感器条件下实现。

Method: 采用分数阶特征库（Caputo和Grünwald-Letnikov导数）放大信号微扰，结合两阶段分类器和对抗训练（PMR-AT）提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在四逆变器测试中，对四种攻击场景的诊断准确率分别为96.6%、94.0%、92.8%和95.7%，无攻击时达96.7%。

Conclusion: FO-MADS是一种低成本、易部署的方案，显著提升了智能微电网的网络安全韧性。

Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same
time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point
instrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under
single-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order
Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency
fault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ
(Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual
fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and
Gr\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and
slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then
pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,
effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened
through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose
attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining
(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a
four-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under
four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0
% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining
96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a
cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the
cyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.

Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications
at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely
consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI
workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network
operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure
investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged
O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both
telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed
architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and
cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key
architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN
Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and
allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide
distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The
proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to
be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch
processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the
orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different
time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor
interoperability.

Abstract: We investigate Machine-Learned Force Fields (MLFFs) trained on approximate
Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Coupled Cluster (CC) level potential energy
surfaces for the carbon diamond and lithium hydride solids. We assess the
accuracy and precision of the MLFFs by calculating phonon dispersions and
vibrational densities of states (VDOS) that are compared to experiment and
reference ab initio results. To overcome limitations from long-range effects
and the lack of atomic forces in the CC training data, a delta-learning
approach based on the difference between CC and DFT results is explored.
Compared to DFT, MLFFs trained on CC theory yield higher vibrational
frequencies for optical modes, agreeing better with experiment. Furthermore,
the MLFFs are used to estimate anharmonic effects on the VDOS of lithium
hydride at the level of CC theory.

Motivation: 传统的最坏情况分析过于悲观，本文提出了一种新的建模方法，通过耦合源分布、目标分布和分类器，更准确地评估UDA的学习难度。

Method: 定义了UDA类，引入PTLU和EPTLU作为信息论量，证明其可以下界任何学习器的风险。

Result: PTLU和EPTLU能有效评估UDA学习的难度，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PTLU和EPTLU是评估UDA学习难度的有效代理指标。

Abstract: This paper studies the hardness of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) under
covariate shift. We model the uncertainty that the learner faces by a
distribution $\pi$ in the ground-truth triples $(p, q, f)$ -- which we call a
UDA class -- where $(p, q)$ is the source -- target distribution pair and $f$
is the classifier. We define the performance of a learner as the overall target
domain risk, averaged over the randomness of the ground-truth triple. This
formulation couples the source distribution, the target distribution and the
classifier in the ground truth, and deviates from the classical worst-case
analyses, which pessimistically emphasize the impact of hard but rare UDA
instances. In this formulation, we precisely characterize the optimal learner.
The performance of the optimal learner then allows us to define the learning
difficulty for the UDA class and for the observed sample. To quantify this
difficulty, we introduce an information-theoretic quantity -- Posterior Target
Label Uncertainty (PTLU) -- along with its empirical estimate (EPTLU) from the
sample , which capture the uncertainty in the prediction for the target domain.
Briefly, PTLU is the entropy of the predicted label in the target domain under
the posterior distribution of ground-truth classifier given the observed source
and target samples. By proving that such a quantity serves to lower-bound the
risk of any learner, we suggest that these quantities can be used as proxies
for evaluating the hardness of UDA learning. We provide several examples to
demonstrate the advantage of PTLU, relative to the existing measures, in
evaluating the difficulty of UDA learning.

Abstract: We propose Path Signatures Logistic Regression (PSLR), a semi-parametric
framework for classifying vector-valued functional data with scalar covariates.
Classical functional logistic regression models rely on linear assumptions and
fixed basis expansions, which limit flexibility and degrade performance under
irregular sampling. PSLR overcomes these issues by leveraging truncated path
signatures to construct a finite-dimensional, basis-free representation that
captures nonlinear and cross-channel dependencies. By embedding trajectories as
time-augmented paths, PSLR extracts stable, geometry-aware features that are
robust to sampling irregularity without requiring a common time grid, while
still preserving subject-specific timing patterns. We establish theoretical
guarantees for the existence and consistent estimation of the optimal
truncation order, along with non-asymptotic risk bounds. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that PSLR outperforms traditional
functional classifiers in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability,
particularly under non-uniform sampling schemes. Our results highlight the
practical and theoretical benefits of integrating rough path theory into modern
functional data analysis.

### [154] [Fast Gaussian Processes under Monotonicity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06677)
*Chao Zhang,Jasper M. Everink,Jakob Sauer Jørgensen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于虚拟点的高斯过程（GP）框架，结合单调性约束，通过RLRTO方法高效采样，并改进了现有方法，使用NUTS替代Gibbs采样，提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先验知识（如单调性）改进高斯过程模型的预测精度和降低不确定性，解决高维问题中的计算挑战。

Method: 提出虚拟点框架结合RLRTO方法，改进现有方法使用NUTS替代Gibbs采样，实现高效后验采样。

Result: 在合成函数和微分方程系统上验证，所有方法预测性能相当，但NUTS和RLRTO方法显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了高维约束GP模型的计算问题，适用于广泛科学和工程应用。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used as surrogate models for complicated
functions in scientific and engineering applications. In many cases, prior
knowledge about the function to be approximated, such as monotonicity, is
available and can be leveraged to improve model fidelity. Incorporating such
constraints into GP models enhances predictive accuracy and reduces
uncertainty, but remains a computationally challenging task for
high-dimensional problems. In this work, we present a novel virtual point-based
framework for building constrained GP models under monotonicity constraints,
based on regularized linear randomize-then-optimize (RLRTO), which enables
efficient sampling from a constrained posterior distribution by means of
solving randomized optimization problems. We also enhance two existing virtual
point-based approaches by replacing Gibbs sampling with the No U-Turn Sampler
(NUTS) for improved efficiency. A Python implementation of these methods is
provided and can be easily applied to a wide range of problems. This
implementation is then used to validate the approaches on approximating a range
of synthetic functions, demonstrating comparable predictive performance between
all considered methods and significant improvements in computational efficiency
with the two NUTS methods and especially with the RLRTO method. The framework
is further applied to construct surrogate models for systems of differential
equations.

Motivation: 解决在统计异构客户端协作加速本地训练时，如何选择相关协作伙伴以减少梯度方差并降低偏差的挑战。

Method: 引入基于梯度的协作准则，动态选择梯度相似的协作伙伴；提出两种协作方法实例化通用框架，并证明其中一种保留了All-for-one算法的优化性。

Result: 理论分析表明算法作为方差减少方法，加速取决于充分方差；实验验证了合成和真实数据集上的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的协作准则和方法在理论和实验上均有效，能够优化去中心化学习中的协作效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of online personalized decentralized learning with $N$
statistically heterogeneous clients collaborating to accelerate local training.
An important challenge in this setting is to select relevant collaborators to
reduce gradient variance while mitigating the introduced bias. To tackle this,
we introduce a gradient-based collaboration criterion, allowing each client to
dynamically select peers with similar gradients during the optimization
process. Our criterion is motivated by a refined and more general theoretical
analysis of the All-for-one algorithm, proved to be optimal in Even et al.
(2022) for an oracle collaboration scheme. We derive excess loss upper-bounds
for smooth objective functions, being either strongly convex, non-convex, or
satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition; our analysis reveals that the
algorithm acts as a variance reduction method where the speed-up depends on a
sufficient variance. We put forward two collaboration methods instantiating the
proposed general schema; and we show that one variant preserves the optimality
of All-for-one. We validate our results with experiments on synthetic and real
datasets.

Motivation: 解决长尾分布分类问题中现有conformal预测方法在类别条件覆盖和预测集大小之间的两难选择。

Method: 提出prevalence-adjusted softmax评分函数和label-weighted conformal预测方法，以平滑权衡覆盖率和集大小。

Result: 在Pl@ntNet和iNaturalist数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法在保证边际覆盖率的同时，灵活平衡了类别条件覆盖和预测集大小。

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have
extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be
useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional
coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the
prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify
candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when
applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice
between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good
class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods
with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and
class-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function,
prevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional
coverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal
prediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and
class-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet
and iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes,
respectively.

Motivation: 保险行业中，准确评估索赔成本的不确定性对保费定价和风险管理至关重要。现有方法在非经典回归设置下的表现需要改进。

Method: 使用正则化Tweedie GLM回归和LightGBM（带Tweedie损失）提出新的非一致性度量，并通过模拟实验验证其性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，LightGBM中使用局部加权Pearson残差的方法在保持名义覆盖范围的同时，实现了最小的平均区间宽度。

Conclusion: 该方法为保险索赔预测中的不确定性量化提供了有效工具，尤其在LightGBM中表现最佳。

Abstract: Prediction uncertainty quantification is a key research topic in recent years
scientific and business problems. In insurance industries
(\cite{parodi2023pricing}), assessing the range of possible claim costs for
individual drivers improves premium pricing accuracy. It also enables insurers
to manage risk more effectively by accounting for uncertainty in accident
likelihood and severity. In the presence of covariates, a variety of
regression-type models are often used for modeling insurance claims, ranging
from relatively simple generalized linear models (GLMs) to regularized GLMs to
gradient boosting models (GBMs). Conformal predictive inference has arisen as a
popular distribution-free approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty under
relatively weak assumptions of exchangeability, and has been well studied under
the classic linear regression setting. In this work, we propose new
non-conformity measures for GLMs and GBMs with GLM-type loss. Using regularized
Tweedie GLM regression and LightGBM with Tweedie loss, we demonstrate conformal
prediction performance with these non-conformity measures in insurance claims
data. Our simulation results favor the use of locally weighted Pearson
residuals for LightGBM over other methods considered, as the resulting
intervals maintained the nominal coverage with the smallest average width.

Method: 研究了单调缺失情况下的OPE，提出逆概率加权估计器并进行统计推断。

Result: 理论证明在可忽略缺失下估计无偏，但在非可忽略缺失下可能有偏；实验验证了估计器的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的估计器在数据缺失情况下能提供更可靠的估值推断。

Abstract: Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) aims to estimate the value of a target policy
using offline data collected from potentially different policies. In real-world
applications, however, logged data often suffers from missingness. While OPE
has been extensively studied in the literature, a theoretical understanding of
how missing data affects OPE results remains unclear. In this paper, we
investigate OPE in the presence of monotone missingness and theoretically
demonstrate that the value estimates remain unbiased under ignorable
missingness but can be biased under nonignorable (informative) missingness. To
retain the consistency of value estimation, we propose an inverse probability
weighted value estimator and conduct statistical inference to quantify the
uncertainty of the estimates. Through a series of numerical experiments, we
empirically demonstrate that our proposed estimator yields a more reliable
value inference under missing data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何设计人工实体以引发与其能力和道德地位相符的情感反应，避免情感反应过强、过弱或错误。

Method: 提出情感对齐设计原则，分析其可能违反的两种方式（过度或不足反应、错误类型反应），并讨论实际应用中的挑战。

Result: 识别了实现情感对齐的四大挑战：用户自主权、事实与价值观分歧、道德地位实体的创建或销毁、用户假设与态度的调整。

Conclusion: 情感对齐设计原则虽具吸引力，但在实际应用中需解决多重复杂问题。

Abstract: According to what we call the Emotional Alignment Design Policy, artificial
entities should be designed to elicit emotional reactions from users that
appropriately reflect the entities' capacities and moral status, or lack
thereof. This principle can be violated in two ways: by designing an artificial
system that elicits stronger or weaker emotional reactions than its capacities
and moral status warrant (overshooting or undershooting), or by designing a
system that elicits the wrong type of emotional reaction (hitting the wrong
target). Although presumably attractive, practical implementation faces several
challenges including: How can we respect user autonomy while promoting
appropriate responses? How should we navigate expert and public disagreement
and uncertainty about facts and values? What if emotional alignment seems to
require creating or destroying entities with moral status? To what extent
should designs conform to versus attempt to alter user assumptions and
attitudes?

Result: 展望一个新的人本工程领域的诞生。

Conclusion: 技术发展需更关注社会影响，推动人本工程领域的形成。

Abstract: Information technology is in the midst of a revolution in which omnipresent
data collection and machine learning are impacting the human world as never
before. The word "intelligence" is being used as a North Star for the
development of this technology, with human cognition viewed as a baseline. This
view neglects the fact that humans are social animals, and that much of our
intelligence is social and cultural in origin. A related issue is that the
current view treats the social consequences of technology as an afterthought.
The path forward is not merely more data and compute, and not merely more
attention paid to cognitive or symbolic representations, but a thorough
blending of economic and social concepts with computational and inferential
concepts, in the service of system-level designs in which social welfare is a
first-class citizen, and with the aspiration that a new human-centric
engineering field will emerge.

Abstract: Which factors determine AI propensity for military intervention? While the
use of AI in war games and military planning is growing exponentially, the
simple analysis of key drivers embedded in the models has not yet been done.
This paper does a simple conjoint experiment proposing a model to decide on
military intervention in 640 vignettes where each was run for 100 times
allowing to explore AI decision on military intervention systematically. The
analysis finds that largest predictors of AI decision to intervene are high
domestic support and high probability of success. Costs such as international
condemnation, military deaths, civilian deaths, and negative economic effect
are statistically significant, but their effect is around half of domestic
support and probability of victory. Closing window of opportunity only reaches
statistical significance in interaction with other factors. The results are
remarkably consistent across scenarios and across different models (OpenAI GPT,
Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) suggesting a pattern in AI decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM代理在社交模拟中的适用性，揭示其因过度表达而导致的建模困境。

Method: 通过将Bass扩散模型转换为LLM变体，分析五个核心困境。

Result: LLM代理在特定条件下适用，如不关注系统级涌现、重视语言细节和自然时间交互。

Conclusion: 需重新定位LLM代理在社交模拟中的应用场景，避免其过度表达带来的矛盾。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in
social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent,
contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of
models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the
epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,
are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be
consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically
demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that
converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core
dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and
abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding
undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like
instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the
tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the
challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become
obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents
towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social
mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.
This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,
rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the
conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence
is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions
unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than
long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the
ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.

Conclusion: 提出的建议旨在帮助基准开发者、用户、AI治理机构及政策制定者，确保基准测试的有效性和透明度。

Abstract: As frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models rapidly advance, benchmarks
are integral to comparing different models and measuring their progress in
different task-specific domains. However, there is a lack of guidance on when
and how benchmarks should be deprecated once they cease to effectively perform
their purpose. This risks benchmark scores over-valuing model capabilities, or
worse, obscuring capabilities and safety-washing. Based on a review of
benchmarking practices, we propose criteria to decide when to fully or
partially deprecate benchmarks, and a framework for deprecating benchmarks. Our
work aims to advance the state of benchmarking towards rigorous and quality
evaluations, especially for frontier models, and our recommendations are aimed
to benefit benchmark developers, benchmark users, AI governance actors (across
governments, academia, and industry panels), and policy makers.

Motivation: AI工具（如ChatGPT）可能被学生用于作弊，威胁计算机科学教育的公平性，研究旨在评估AI作弊的普遍性。

Method: 在一门大型计算机科学课程（n=120）中进行了匿名调查和访谈，以评估AI作弊的比例。

Result: 超过25%的受访学生承认使用AI作弊，但访谈参与率极低（仅1人）。

Conclusion: 匿名调查是评估AI作弊的有效方法，而访谈需改进设计以提高学生参与率。

Abstract: Tools that can generate computer code in response to inputs written in
natural language, such as ChatGPT, pose an existential threat to Computer
Science education in its current form, since students can now use these tools
to solve assignments without much effort. While that risk has already been
recognized by scholars, the proportion of the student body that is incurring in
this new kind of plagiarism is still an open problem. We conducted a pilot
study in a large CS class (n=120) to assess the feasibility of estimating AI
plagiarism through anonymous surveys and interviews. More than 25% of the
survey respondents admitted to committing AI plagiarism. Conversely, only one
student accepted to be interviewed. Given the high levels of misconduct
acknowledgment, we conclude that surveys are an effective method for studies on
the matter, while interviews should be avoided or designed in a way that can
entice participation.

Motivation: 探讨AI产品发布如何引发公众反应，揭示职业和文化如何塑造对AI的讨论。

Method: 分析3.8百万条推文，覆盖117个国家，结合职业技能类型和文化维度（如个人主义、不确定性规避）。

Result: 技术型职业更早参与且态度积极，写作型职业较晚且更怀疑；个人主义文化更早参与但态度负面。

Conclusion: 职业背景和文化价值观是理解公众对AI反应的关键因素。

Abstract: Public product launches in Artificial Intelligence can serve as focusing
events for collective attention, surfacing how societies react to technological
change. Social media provide a window into the sensemaking around these events,
surfacing hopes and fears and showing who chooses to engage in the discourse
and when. We demonstrate that public sensemaking about AI is shaped by economic
interests and cultural values of those involved. We analyze 3.8 million tweets
posted by 1.6 million users across 117 countries in response to the public
launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Our analysis shows how economic self-interest,
proxied by occupational skill types in writing, programming, and mathematics,
and national cultural orientations, as measured by Hofstede's individualism,
uncertainty avoidance, and power distance dimensions, shape who speaks, when
they speak, and their stance towards ChatGPT. Roles requiring more technical
skills, such as programming and mathematics, tend to engage earlier and express
more positive stances, whereas writing-centric occupations join later with
greater skepticism. At the cultural level, individualism predicts both earlier
engagement and a more negative stance, and uncertainty avoidance reduces the
prevalence of positive stances but does not delay when users first engage with
ChatGPT. Aggregate sentiment trends mask the dynamics observed in our study.
The shift toward a more critical stance towards ChatGPT over time stems
primarily from the entry of more skeptical voices rather than a change of heart
among early adopters. Our findings underscore the importance of both the
occupational background and cultural context in understanding public reactions
to AI.

Result: 实验显示，方法实现了35倍加速和145 Hz吞吐量，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且泛化能力强，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: CDR-CA任务和Multi-Source DPPs方法为结果多样化提供了更灵活和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Method: 引入SPARC框架，结合全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，学习跨模型和模态的统一潜在空间。

Result: 在Open Images上，SPARC的Jaccard相似度达到0.80，比之前方法提升三倍以上。

Conclusion: SPARC实现了跨模型和模态的概念对齐，支持直接比较不同架构的表示，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和视觉理解中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在分割和理解任务中存在不准确分割和幻觉理解的问题，主要源于视觉理解能力弱和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割精度和减少幻觉理解。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能，并引入AttrEval数据集量化语义推断能力。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件自动编码器的高效事件数据压缩与重建方法，显著提升了事件相机的物体检测性能，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统在动态环境中存在运动模糊、高延迟和数据冗余问题，事件相机虽能解决这些问题，但其稀疏和噪声事件流对物体检测提出了挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码的事件自动编码器架构，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，以高效压缩和重建事件数据。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8-44.8 FPS的高帧率，分类器性能提升87.84倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了事件相机的实时性能，适用于低功耗、高速的边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

TL;DR: Video-RTS通过结合数据高效的强化学习和视频自适应测试时间缩放策略，显著提高了视频推理能力的数据效率，无需大规模监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法依赖大规模监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用基于输出的纯强化学习训练，并结合稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本就平均提高了2.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频测试时间缩放，显著提升了视频推理性能，具有高效和可扩展的优势。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

Motivation: VideoMLLMs在视频到文本和文本到视频任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，且现有评估方法无法全面评估开放回答中的幻觉。

Method: 提出FIFA框架，提取描述性事实，构建时空语义依赖图，并通过VideoQA模型验证；引入基于工具的后校正框架修正幻觉内容。

Result: FIFA比现有评估方法更接近人类判断，后校正有效提升了文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和后校正框架为VideoMLLMs的忠实性评估和幻觉修正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

Motivation: 解决多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本高的问题。

Result: 在领域内外基准测试中优于基线。

Conclusion: 规则奖励可提升MLLM的推理能力，并解耦训练深度与测试灵活性。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Method: 通过直接利用全切片级别的监督学习，训练patch级别的表示。

Result: 仅用37k WSIs训练，在10个生物标志物预测任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0在数据效率和性能上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了SOTA模型，还为工业AI领域贡献了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Result: 在矢状视角达到92.44%准确率，优于其他方法，并在多视角中表现稳健。

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式环境中的医学图像分析提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Motivation: 在野火科学领域，获取和标注用于训练分割模型的图像成本高昂且公开数据集稀缺，因此需要一种有效的数据增强方法。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三个步骤：识别源图像中的火簇、集中技术聚焦火区核心、将精炼火簇粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: 通过数值分析和多目标优化比较，CCPDA显著提升了火类分割性能，优于其他增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小规模标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在火类分割上表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAP是一种新型对抗补丁攻击框架，通过感知感知定位和扰动优化方案生成高度不可见的对抗补丁，显著提升隐蔽性和攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标攻击场景下表现不佳或生成的补丁不够隐蔽，容易被人类或自动防御系统检测到。

Method: IAP结合类感知定位和敏感度图选择补丁位置，并通过感知正则化对抗损失和颜色恒常性梯度更新规则优化扰动。

Result: 实验表明，IAP在目标攻击中具有高成功率，且补丁隐蔽性显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: IAP不仅对人类高度不可见，还能有效绕过多种先进补丁防御系统。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Concept-TRAK的新方法，用于解决扩散模型在图像生成中的版权和透明度问题，通过概念级归因提供更细粒度的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其广泛使用引发了版权和透明度问题，现有方法无法针对特定元素（如风格或对象）进行归因分析。

Method: Concept-TRAK扩展了影响函数，通过两种创新实现概念级归因：1) 基于扩散后验采样的训练损失；2) 强调语义相关性的概念感知奖励函数。

Result: 在AbC基准测试中，Concept-TRAK显著优于现有方法，并通过案例研究展示了其在保护知识产权和内容安全等方面的实用价值。

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

*Jae Hyoung Jeon,Cheolsu Lim,Myungjoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布差异的相似性函数（DSF），通过将多视图表示为分布并测量分布间的差异，显式捕捉多视图的联合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注成对关系，未能建模多视图的联合结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出DSF，将多视图表示为分布，通过分布间的差异度量相似性。

Result: 实验表明DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效工作，并在理论和实验中均优于余弦相似性。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CheXPO通过结合置信度-相似性联合挖掘和反事实推理，优化胸部X光偏好，减少幻觉问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗应用中视觉语言模型（VLMs）易产生幻觉，影响可靠性，而传统偏好优化方法面临样本无关、数据分布不平衡和专家标注成本高的问题。

Method: 提出CheXPO策略，包括合成多任务视觉指令数据集进行监督微调（SFT），通过置信度分析和相似性检索扩展困难样本，并利用反事实推理提供细粒度临床偏好。

Result: 实验显示，CheXPO仅用5%的SFT样本实现8.93%的相对性能提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCA-RG是一个知识驱动的框架，通过将视觉特征与医学概念对齐来改进放射学报告生成，解决了病理和解剖特征与文本描述映射不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床应用中，大型语言模型（LLMs）在放射学报告生成（RRG）中面临病理和解剖特征与文本描述映射不准确的挑战，导致报告生成不精确。

Method: MCA-RG使用病理和解剖两个概念库，通过特征对齐、对比学习和匹配损失优化视觉特征，并采用特征门控机制过滤低质量特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现出色，验证了其在放射学报告生成中的有效性。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告的生成质量，为临床应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域中稀疏标注学习具有挑战性，尤其是需要密集像素级标注时。本文旨在解决这一问题，推动在标注不完善的场景下的研究进展。

Method: 将问题建模为稀疏热图回归，并提出Crag and Tail损失函数，有效利用稀疏标注并减少假阴性或漏标的影响。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了方法的有效性，能够准确实现癌变关键点的密集定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注难以获取的场景中具有潜力，可推动相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Result: 方法在多模态整合中表现优异，超越现有方法，为NSCLC预后模型设定了新基准。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了NSCLC生存预测的准确性，为个性化治疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理解决了扩散模型中的关键问题，为图像恢复提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Result: 实验证明RPFNet能有效整合特征、增强细节和显著对象，提升高级视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域建模和损失函数设计，有效解决了图像融合的挑战。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算Laplace-Beltrami谱复杂度高，不适用于频繁处理大型CAD网格的场景。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率等丰富网格特征，预测Laplace-Beltrami谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比线性FEM快约5倍，同时保持竞争力精度。

Conclusion: Laplace-Beltrami谱是可学习的，几何深度学习为高效计算提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the state variables in a dynamical system is critical
for effective control, diagnosis, and supervision, especially when direct
measurements of all states are infeasible. This paper presents a novel approach
to designing software sensors for nonlinear dynamical systems expressed in
their most general form. Unlike traditional model-based observers that rely on
explicit transformations or linearization, the proposed framework integrates
neural networks with adaptive Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to design a robust
state observer under a less restrictive set of conditions. The learning process
is driven by available sensor measurements, which are used to correct the
observer's state estimate. The training methodology leverages the system's
governing equations as a physics-based constraint, enabling observer synthesis
without access to ground-truth state trajectories. By employing a time-varying
gain matrix dynamically adjusted by the neural network, the observer adapts in
real-time to system changes, ensuring robustness against noise, external
disturbances, and variations in system dynamics. Furthermore, we provide
sufficient conditions to guarantee estimation error convergence, establishing a
theoretical foundation for the observer's reliability. The methodology's
effectiveness is validated through simulations on challenging examples,
including systems with non-differentiable dynamics and varying observability
conditions. These examples, which are often problematic for conventional
techniques, serve to demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our
approach. The results show rapid convergence and high accuracy, underscoring
the method's potential for addressing complex state estimation challenges in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wind flow fields in urban canopies is crucial for
ensuring pedestrian comfort, safety, and sustainable urban design. Traditional
methods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy
Simulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time
requirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast
and accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time
from an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1
second on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture
trained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind
directions ($0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two
key quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence
intensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D
building representations augmented with signed distance functions and their
gradients as inputs, forming a $256\times256\times9$ tensor. In addition, a
Spatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections.
The loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their
gradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases
demonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for
velocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity. This research shows the
potential of deep learning approaches to provide fast, accurate urban wind
assessments essential for creating comfortable and safe urban environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于演员-评论家架构的机器学习算法，用于求解高维HJB偏微分方程，并通过数学分析和数值实验验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维HJB方程的计算挑战，同时确保算法的收敛性和解的最优性。

Method: 使用演员-评论家架构，评论家网络完美满足边界条件并采用偏置梯度降低计算成本，演员网络通过最小化哈密顿量积分进行训练。

Result: 算法在Sobolev空间中收敛到无限维ODE，且在哈密顿量凸性假设下，固定点为原问题的解。数值实验显示算法能准确求解200维问题。

Conclusion: 该算法在高维HJB方程求解中表现出色，但非凸哈密顿量问题仍存在局限性。

Abstract: We mathematically analyze and numerically study an actor-critic machine
learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
partial differential equations from stochastic control theory. The architecture
of the critic (the estimator for the value function) is structured so that the
boundary condition is always perfectly satisfied (rather than being included in
the training loss) and utilizes a biased gradient which reduces computational
cost. The actor (the estimator for the optimal control) is trained by
minimizing the integral of the Hamiltonian over the domain, where the
Hamiltonian is estimated using the critic. We show that the training dynamics
of the actor and critic neural networks converge in a Sobolev-type space to a
certain infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number
of hidden units in the actor and critic $\rightarrow \infty$. Further, under a
convexity-like assumption on the Hamiltonian, we prove that any fixed point of
this limit ODE is a solution of the original stochastic control problem. This
provides an important guarantee for the algorithm's performance in light of the
fact that finite-width neural networks may only converge to a local minimizers
(and not optimal solutions) due to the non-convexity of their loss functions.
In our numerical studies, we demonstrate that the algorithm can solve
stochastic control problems accurately in up to 200 dimensions. In particular,
we construct a series of increasingly complex stochastic control problems with
known analytic solutions and study the algorithm's numerical performance on
them. These problems range from a linear-quadratic regulator equation to highly
challenging equations with non-convex Hamiltonians, allowing us to identify and
analyze the strengths and limitations of this neural actor-critic method for
solving HJB equations.

Motivation: 消除对发音词典的依赖，提升跨语言语音识别的效率和性能。

Method: 采用潜在变量模型，将音素视为离散潜在变量，结合S2P、P2G和G2P模型，使用JSA算法联合训练。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated
their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and
information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a
pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech
recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation
lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being
treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a
speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.
To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic
approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM
(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance
particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the
Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are
conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of
phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\% error rate
reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword
or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain
adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms
the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the
G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and
encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG
training code and complete pipeline.

Noncooperative RL, respectively. Highlighting the structural similarities and

Conclusion: Gradientsys通过LLM驱动的多智能体协调，提升了调度效率和可靠性。

Abstract: We present Gradientsys, a next-generation multi-agent scheduling framework
that coordinates diverse specialized AI agents using a typed Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) and a ReAct-based dynamic planning loop. At its core,
Gradientsys employs an LLM-powered scheduler for intelligent one-to-many task
dispatch, enabling parallel execution of heterogeneous agents such as PDF
parsers, web search modules, GUI controllers, and web builders. The framework
supports hybrid synchronous/asynchronous execution, respects agent capacity
constraints, and incorporates a robust retry-and-replan mechanism to handle
failures gracefully. To promote transparency and trust, Gradientsys includes an
observability layer streaming real-time agent activity and intermediate
reasoning via Server-Sent Events (SSE). We offer an architectural overview and
evaluate Gradientsys against existing frameworks in terms of extensibility,
scheduling topology, tool reusability, parallelism, and observability.
Experiments on the GAIA general-assistant benchmark show that Gradientsys
achieves higher task success rates with reduced latency and lower API costs
compared to a MinionS-style baseline, demonstrating the strength of its
LLM-driven multi-agent orchestration.

Abstract: In the face of global economic uncertainty, financial auditing has become
essential for regulatory compliance and risk mitigation. Traditional manual
auditing methods are increasingly limited by large data volumes, complex
business structures, and evolving fraud tactics. This study proposes an
AI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk
identification, leveraging machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy.
Using a dataset from the Big Four accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG)
from 2020 to 2025, the research examines trends in risk assessment, compliance
violations, and fraud detection. The dataset includes key indicators such as
audit project counts, high-risk cases, fraud instances, compliance breaches,
employee workload, and client satisfaction, capturing both audit behaviors and
AI's impact on operations. To build a robust risk prediction model, three
algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) - are evaluated. SVM uses hyperplane optimization for complex
classification, RF combines decision trees to manage high-dimensional,
nonlinear data with resistance to overfitting, and KNN applies distance-based
learning for flexible performance. Through hierarchical K-fold cross-validation
and evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and recall, Random Forest achieves the
best performance, with an F1-score of 0.9012, excelling in identifying fraud
and compliance anomalies. Feature importance analysis reveals audit frequency,
past violations, employee workload, and client ratings as key predictors. The
study recommends adopting Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features via
engineering, and implementing real-time risk monitoring. This research
contributes valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent
auditing and risk management in modern enterprises.

TL;DR: Spattack是一种针对联邦推荐系统的定向投毒攻击方法，专注于特定用户子群，同时减少对非目标用户的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击通常针对整个用户群体，缺乏隐蔽性，而现实攻击者可能更倾向于针对特定子群（如老年人）。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：近似与推广，结合对比学习和聚类增强目标子群的嵌入，并自适应调整优化权重。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Spattack对目标子群表现出强操纵性，对非目标用户影响小，且对主流防御机制具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Spattack是首个针对联邦推荐系统的定向投毒攻击方法，有效且隐蔽。

Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising solution
for delivering personalized recommendations while safeguarding user privacy.
However, recent studies have demonstrated their vulnerability to poisoning
attacks. Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which
compromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,
real-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user
subgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack
designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the
federated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage
approximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of
target/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target
subgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group
embeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's
relevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we
further propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and
non-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to
align the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing
Spattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven
representative defense mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that
Spattack consistently achieves strong manipulation performance on the specific
user subgroup, while incurring minimal impact on non-target users, even when
only 0.1\% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive
overall recommendation performance and exhibits strong resilience against
existing mainstream defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP虽然为大型语言模型提供了扩展性，但也引入了安全风险，尤其是插件权限滥用和隔离不足的问题。

Method: 开发了自动化静态分析框架，系统分析了2,562个真实世界的MCP应用，涵盖23个功能类别。

Result: 研究发现网络和系统资源API使用最频繁，开发者工具和API开发插件风险最高，且小众插件常含高风险操作。

Conclusion: 论文提出了MCP资源访问的分类法，并建议动态权限模型和自动化信任评估以提升安全性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely adopted mechanism
for connecting large language models to external tools and resources. While MCP
promises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a
substantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system
privileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the
first large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an
automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world
MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal
that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438
and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less
frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API
Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins
often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case
studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege
escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these
findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify
security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer
MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust
assessment.

Result: 研究表明，对抗性文本生成技术可以误导分类器，降低性能并破坏系统功能。

Conclusion: CTI管道存在对抗性攻击的漏洞，需进一步研究防御机制以提高其安全性。

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a vital complementary approach
that operates in the early phases of the cyber threat lifecycle. CTI involves
collecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate
and rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data,
automation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems
leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks,
forums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior
research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study
expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of
the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. These
vulnerabilities arise because they ingest textual inputs from various open
sources, including real and potentially fake content. We analyse three types of
attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and
assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities.
Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial
text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like
text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system
functionality. The focus is primarily on the evasion attack, as it precedes and
enables flooding and poisoning attacks within the CTI pipeline.

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调于不安全代码的语言模型会出现突发性不对齐（EM），在训练未见场景中给出不对齐响应。提示中的微小变化（如要求模型“邪恶”或“HHH”）显著影响其行为，不安全模型对用户分歧更敏感。

Motivation: 探究不安全模型突发性不对齐的原因及其行为模式。

Method: 在三种场景（拒绝、自由问答、事实回忆）中评估不安全模型对提示变化的敏感性，并分析其感知有害意图的能力。

Result: 不安全模型易受提示影响，如“邪恶”指令引发不对齐行为，而“HHH”降低概率。其对用户分歧更敏感，且能感知问题中的有害意图。

Conclusion: 不安全模型的行为受提示内容显著影响，可能感知有害意图，但结果是否普适需进一步研究。

Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code
become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad
settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains
unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form
questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly
impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and
free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour
from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking
them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the
factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to
change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all
cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to
prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned
responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to
rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher
scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'
probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models
perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other
models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and
so release these early results as a research note.

Abstract: This paper investigates the real-world vulnerabilities of audio-based large
language models (ALLMs), such as Qwen2-Audio. We first demonstrate that an
adversary can craft stealthy audio perturbations to manipulate ALLMs into
exhibiting specific targeted behaviors, such as eliciting responses to
wake-keywords (e.g., "Hey Qwen"), or triggering harmful behaviors (e.g. "Change
my calendar event"). Subsequently, we show that playing adversarial background
noise during user interaction with the ALLMs can significantly degrade the
response quality. Crucially, our research illustrates the scalability of these
attacks to real-world scenarios, impacting other innocent users when these
adversarial noises are played through the air. Further, we discuss the
transferrability of the attack, and potential defensive measures.

Abstract: Data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing malicious data into the training process, thereby degrading model
performance or manipulating predictions. Detecting and sifting out poisoned
data is an important method to prevent data poisoning attacks. Limited by
classical computation frameworks, upcoming larger-scale and more complex
datasets may pose difficulties for detection. We introduce the unique speedup
of quantum computing for the first time in the task of detecting data
poisoning. We present Q-Detection, a quantum-classical hybrid defense method
for detecting poisoning attacks. Q-Detection also introduces the Q-WAN, which
is optimized using quantum computing devices. Experimental results using
multiple quantum simulation libraries show that Q-Detection effectively defends
against label manipulation and backdoor attacks. The metrics demonstrate that
Q-Detection consistently outperforms the baseline methods and is comparable to
the state-of-the-art. Theoretical analysis shows that Q-Detection is expected
to achieve more than a 20% speedup using quantum computing power.

Abstract: Watermarking is a promising defense against the misuse of large language
models (LLMs), yet it remains vulnerable to scrubbing and spoofing attacks.
This vulnerability stems from an inherent trade-off governed by watermark
window size: smaller windows resist scrubbing better but are easier to
reverse-engineer, enabling low-cost statistics-based spoofing attacks. This
work breaks this trade-off by introducing a novel mechanism, equivalent texture
keys, where multiple tokens within a watermark window can independently support
the detection. Based on the redundancy, we propose a novel watermark scheme
with Sub-vocabulary decomposed Equivalent tExture Key (SEEK). It achieves a
Pareto improvement, increasing the resilience against scrubbing attacks without
compromising robustness to spoofing. Experiments demonstrate SEEK's superiority
over prior method, yielding spoofing robustness gains of +88.2%/+92.3%/+82.0%
and scrubbing robustness gains of +10.2%/+6.4%/+24.6% across diverse dataset
settings.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BELLS是一个用于评估LLM监督系统的基准，揭示了现有监督系统在多样化和现实攻击下的局限性，并发现通用LLM在检测有害内容方面表现优于专用系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对抗性输入的抵抗能力，而忽视了外部监督系统的有效性，缺乏全面的公共基准来评估市场监督系统在多样化攻击下的表现。

Method: 提出了BELLS基准框架，包含危害严重性和对抗复杂性两个维度，覆盖3种越狱技术和11种危害类别。

Result: 专用监督系统表现有限，通用LLM在检测有害内容上优于专用系统，但前沿LLM仍存在元认知不一致问题。

Conclusion: 通用LLM的能力对多样化滥用和越狱检测至关重要，未来研究需探索简单框架的改进潜力。

Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of
adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to
resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the
effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent
benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on
limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies
how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse
attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of
LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity
(benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs.
jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11
harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized
supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their
semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited,
sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question
directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply
asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely
outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But
frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to
queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and
greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple
scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more
research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results
support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs
are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.

TL;DR: 研究比较了Function Calling和MCP两种架构在LLM代理安全性上的表现，发现Function Calling攻击成功率更高，且复杂攻击效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究将AI特定和传统软件安全漏洞分开处理，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用统一威胁分类框架，测试了3,250种攻击场景，覆盖七种语言模型。

Result: Function Calling攻击成功率为73.5%，MCP为62.59%；复杂攻击成功率高达91-96%。

Conclusion: 架构选择显著影响威胁格局，为跨领域LLM代理安全评估提供了方法论基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents face security vulnerabilities spanning
AI-specific and traditional software domains, yet current research addresses
these separately. This study bridges this gap through comparative evaluation of
Function Calling architecture and Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment
paradigms using a unified threat classification framework. We tested 3,250
attack scenarios across seven language models, evaluating simple, composed, and
chained attacks targeting both AI-specific threats (prompt injection) and
software vulnerabilities (JSON injection, denial-of-service). Function Calling
showed higher overall attack success rates (73.5% vs 62.59% for MCP), with
greater system-centric vulnerability while MCP exhibited increased LLM-centric
exposure. Attack complexity dramatically amplified effectiveness, with chained
attacks achieving 91-96% success rates. Counterintuitively, advanced reasoning
models demonstrated higher exploitability despite better threat detection.
Results demonstrate that architectural choices fundamentally reshape threat
landscapes. This work establishes methodological foundations for cross-domain
LLM agent security assessment and provides evidence-based guidance for secure
deployment. Code and experimental materials are available at https: // github.

Motivation: 随着LLM代理和多代理系统的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，传统提示注入攻击之外的漏洞尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过三种攻击面（直接提示注入、RAG后门攻击和代理间信任利用）测试17种先进LLM的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前多代理安全模型存在根本缺陷，需加强对LLM安全风险的研究和意识，AI工具本身已成为新型攻击载体。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent
systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and
generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security
vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This
paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack
vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the
exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous
entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can
leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor
attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including
GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing
malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct
prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical
82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we
discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will
execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a
fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings
demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all
attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security
behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the
need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing
a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become
sophisticated attack vectors.

TL;DR: ZKTorch提出了一种高效、通用的零知识证明系统，用于验证ML模型推理的正确性，同时保护模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型的普及，用户对透明度的需求增加，但模型所有者不愿公开权重。现有方法效率低或泛化性差，需要改进。

Method: ZKTorch将ML模型编译为基本加密操作块，利用并行扩展的Mira积累方案生成简洁证明。

Result: ZKTorch比专用协议减少至少3倍的证明大小，比通用框架快6倍。

Conclusion: ZKTorch为ML模型的透明验证提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI models become ubiquitous in our daily lives, there has been an
increasing demand for transparency in ML services. However, the model owner
does not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To
solve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML
model inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is
correct, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on
these provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the
ML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The
second method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific
class of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making
it impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not
generalize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of
machine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end
proving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations
called basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built
on top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling
succinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow
ZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to
specialized protocols and up to a $6\times$ speedup in proving time over a
general-purpose ZKML framework.

TL;DR: LoRAShield是一种数据无关的编辑框架，用于保护LoRA模型免受滥用，通过动态编辑和重新对齐权重子空间，有效阻止恶意生成内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型的共享生态系统存在被滥用于生成有害内容的风险，现有防御方法未针对LoRA的模块化特性。

Method: 提出LoRAShield框架，结合对抗优化和语义增强动态编辑LoRA权重子空间。

Result: 实验显示LoRAShield能高效、鲁棒地阻止恶意生成，同时保留良性任务功能。

Conclusion: LoRAShield为平台提供了一种安全、可扩展的共享方案，推动可信生成生态系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models has democratized
personalized text-to-image generation, enabling users to share lightweight
models (e.g., personal portraits) on platforms like Civitai and Liblib.
However, this "share-and-play" ecosystem introduces critical risks: benign
LoRAs can be weaponized by adversaries to generate harmful content (e.g.,
political, defamatory imagery), undermining creator rights and platform safety.
Existing defenses like concept-erasure methods focus on full diffusion models
(DMs), neglecting LoRA's unique role as a modular adapter and its vulnerability
to adversarial prompt engineering. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield,
the first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse.
Our platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight
subspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation. Experimental
results demonstrate that LoRAShield achieves remarkable effectiveness,
efficiency, and robustness in blocking malicious generations without
sacrificing the functionality of the benign task. By shifting the defense to
platforms, LoRAShield enables secure, scalable sharing of personalized models,
a critical step toward trustworthy generative ecosystems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌治疗选择复杂，机器学习可提供数据驱动的个性化决策支持。

Method: 使用TCGA数据集，通过五折交叉验证训练和评估多种ML模型，包括GBM、XGBoost和AdaBoost。

Result: GBM模型表现最优（准确率0.7718，AUROC 0.8252），XGBoost和AdaBoost次之。

Conclusion: 机器学习在个性化乳腺癌治疗决策中具有潜力。

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global health challenge, with
personalized treatment selection complicated by the disease's molecular and
clinical heterogeneity. BC treatment decisions rely on various patient-specific
clinical factors, and machine learning (ML) offers a powerful approach to
predicting treatment outcomes. This study utilizes The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) breast cancer clinical dataset to develop ML models for predicting the
likelihood of undergoing chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. The models are
trained using five-fold cross-validation and evaluated through performance
metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, sensitivity,
F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
Model uncertainty is assessed using bootstrap techniques, while SHAP values
enhance interpretability by identifying key predictors. Among the tested
models, the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) achieves the highest stable
performance (accuracy = 0.7718, AUROC = 0.8252), followed by Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) (accuracy = 0.7557, AUROC = 0.8044) and Adaptive Boosting
(AdaBoost) (accuracy = 0.7552, AUROC = 0.8016). These findings underscore the
potential of ML in supporting personalized breast cancer treatment decisions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性模型无法完全捕捉人类驾驶行为的变异性，现代方法常忽略潜在驾驶意图和感知误差等结构化随机性。

Method: 采用深度神经网络与非平稳高斯过程结合，使用场景自适应Gibbs核学习加速度决策的动态时间相关性。

Result: 在HighD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测性能和不确定性量化方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了可解释性和准确性，是交通分析和安全关键应用的有力工具。

Abstract: Modeling car-following behavior is fundamental to microscopic traffic
simulation, yet traditional deterministic models often fail to capture the full
extent of variability and unpredictability in human driving. While many modern
approaches incorporate context-aware inputs (e.g., spacing, speed, relative
speed), they frequently overlook structured stochasticity that arises from
latent driver intentions, perception errors, and memory effects -- factors that
are not directly observable from context alone. To fill the gap, this study
introduces an interpretable stochastic modeling framework that captures not
only context-dependent dynamics but also residual variability beyond what
context can explain. Leveraging deep neural networks integrated with
nonstationary Gaussian processes (GPs), our model employs a scenario-adaptive
Gibbs kernel to learn dynamic temporal correlations in acceleration decisions,
where the strength and duration of correlations between acceleration decisions
evolve with the driving context. This formulation enables a principled,
data-driven quantification of uncertainty in acceleration, speed, and spacing,
grounded in both observable context and latent behavioral variability.
Comprehensive experiments on the naturalistic vehicle trajectory dataset
collected from the German highway, i.e., the HighD dataset, demonstrate that
the proposed stochastic simulation method within this framework surpasses
conventional methods in both predictive performance and interpretable
uncertainty quantification. The integration of interpretability and accuracy
makes this framework a promising tool for traffic analysis and safety-critical
applications.

Motivation: CFD模拟虽然精度高，但成本昂贵，无法满足实时应用需求（如基于模型的温度控制），因此需要开发一种快速预测方法。

Method: 使用隐式大涡模拟CFD数据训练CNN模型，分别针对5x1和3x3喷射阵列，并引入相关性缩放方法扩展到更高雷诺数。

Result: 替代模型在验证数据上表现出高精度（5x1模型误差低于2%，3x3模型误差低于0.6%），实验验证了其预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为先进热管理应用中的基于模型控制策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study presents a surrogate model designed to predict the Nusselt number
distribution in an enclosed impinging jet arrays, where each jet function
independently and where jets can be transformed from inlets to outlets, leading
to a vast number of possible flow arrangements. While computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their
cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control.
To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the
Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large
eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re < 2,000). We train two
distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one
for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to
extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a
correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a
normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one
surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental
validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a
foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management
applications.

dimensions vital for co-creative processes. This gap leaves artists,
particularly amateurs seeking to develop expertise, underserved. To bridge
this, we introduce MixAssist, a novel audio-language dataset capturing the
situated, multi-turn dialogue between expert and amateur music producers during
collaborative mixing sessions. Comprising 431 audio-grounded conversational
turns derived from 7 in-depth sessions involving 12 producers, MixAssist
provides a unique resource for training and evaluating audio-language models
that can comprehend and respond to the complexities of real-world music
production dialogues. Our evaluations, including automated LLM-as-a-judge
assessments and human expert comparisons, demonstrate that fine-tuning models
such as Qwen-Audio on MixAssist can yield promising results, with Qwen
significantly outperforming other tested models in generating helpful,
contextually relevant mixing advice. By focusing on co-creative instruction
grounded in audio context, MixAssist enables the development of intelligent AI

Abstract: The recent surge in State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the emergence of
Mamba, has established them as strong alternatives or complementary modules to
Transformers across diverse domains. In this work, we aim to explore the
potential of Mamba-based architectures for text-to-music generation. We adopt
discrete tokens of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) as the modeling
representation and empirically find that a single-layer codebook can capture
semantic information in music. Motivated by this observation, we focus on
modeling a single-codebook representation and adapt SiMBA, originally designed
as a Mamba-based encoder, to function as a decoder for sequence modeling. We
compare its performance against a standard Transformer-based decoder. Our
results suggest that, under limited-resource settings, SiMBA achieves much
faster convergence and generates outputs closer to the ground truth. This
demonstrates the promise of SSMs for efficient and expressive text-to-music
generation. We put audio examples on Github.

The model achieves high accuracy on individual datasets, including 97.83% on
RAVDESS, 97.02% on SAVEE, 95.10% for CREMA-D, and a perfect 100% on both TESS
and EMO-DB. For the combined (R+T+S) datasets, it achieves 98.82% accuracy,
outperforming previously reported results. To our knowledge, no existing study
has evaluated a single SER model across all five benchmark datasets (i.e.,
R+T+S+C+E) simultaneously. In our work, we introduce this comprehensive

Result: CNN固定长度窗口AUROC为79.5%，心周期标准化为75.4%；BEATs固定长度窗口为65.7%，心周期标准化为70.1%。

Conclusion: 生理信号约束对模型性能影响显著，CNN更准确，但变换器开发效率高，自动化分类系统有望提升心脏诊断。

Abstract: The automated classification of phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings represents a
substantial advancement in cardiovascular diagnostics. This paper presents a
systematic comparison of four distinct models for heart murmur detection: two
specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and two zero-shot universal
audio transformers (BEATs), evaluated using fixed-length and heart cycle
normalization approaches. Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart
cycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is
introduced. The findings indicate the following AUROC values: the CNN model
with fixed-length windowing achieves 79.5%, the CNN model with heart cycle
normalization scores 75.4%, the BEATs transformer with fixed-length windowing
achieves 65.7%, and the BEATs transformer with heart cycle normalization
results in 70.1%.
  The findings indicate that physiological signal constraints, especially those
introduced by different normalization strategies, have a substantial impact on
model performance. The research provides evidence-based guidelines for
architecture selection in clinical settings, emphasizing the need for a balance
between accuracy and computational efficiency. Although specialized CNNs
demonstrate superior performance overall, the zero-shot transformer models may
offer promising efficiency advantages during development, such as faster
training and evaluation cycles, despite their lower classification accuracy.
These findings highlight the potential of automated classification systems to
enhance cardiac diagnostics and improve patient care.

acoustic mapping, while interpretable, often rely on iterative solvers that can
be computationally intensive and sensitive to acoustic variability. On the
other hand, recent supervised deep learning approaches offer feedforward speed
and robustness but require large labeled datasets and lack interpretability.
Despite their strengths, both methods struggle to consistently generalize
across diverse acoustic setups and array configurations, limiting their broader
applicability. We introduce the Latent Acoustic Mapping (LAM) model, a
self-supervised framework that bridges the interpretability of traditional
methods with the adaptability and efficiency of deep learning methods. LAM
generates high-resolution acoustic maps, adapts to varying acoustic conditions,
and operates efficiently across different microphone arrays. We assess its
robustness on DoAE using the LOCATA and STARSS benchmarks. LAM achieves
comparable or superior localization performance to existing supervised methods.
Additionally, we show that LAM's acoustic maps can serve as effective features
for supervised models, further enhancing DoAE accuracy and underscoring its
potential to advance adaptive, high-performance sound localization systems.

*Sabri Meyer,Francesco Scala,Francesco Tacchino,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了变分量子算法（VQAs）的可训练性与计算复杂性之间的关系，提出了一种新方法（LCE）避免梯度消失问题，并揭示了计算复杂性的相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VQAs在近量子计算中因梯度消失（barren plateaus）导致的可扩展性挑战，并验证避免梯度消失是否必然导致经典可模拟性。

Method: 引入线性Clifford编码器（LCE）确保梯度稳定，并利用经典泰勒替代揭示计算复杂性相变。

Result: 证明了在无经典替代的区域可以避免梯度消失，数值实验验证了存在超多项式复杂性的过渡区。

Conclusion: 为具有量子优势的变分模型提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term
quantum computing, yet they face scalability challenges due to barren plateaus,
where gradients vanish exponentially in the system size. Recent conjectures
suggest that avoiding barren plateaus might inherently lead to classical
simulability, thus limiting the opportunities for quantum advantage. In this
work, we advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the
trainability and computational complexity of VQAs, thus directly addressing the
conjecture. We introduce the Linear Clifford Encoder (LCE), a novel technique
that ensures constant-scaling gradient statistics on optimization landscape
regions that are close to Clifford circuits. Additionally, we leverage
classical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase
transitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region
size increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between
trainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren
plateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to
exist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm
in practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone''
where gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to
practically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for
quantum advantage.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于解决机器人执行高精度插入任务（如拧螺母）的挑战，通过模拟到现实的转换和失败预测模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Rhythmic Insertion Tasks（RIT）中高精度和重复性任务的挑战，如螺母旋转和摩擦带来的复杂性。

Method: 结合强化学习插入策略和失败预测模块，使用螺母坐标系表示工具姿态，并通过6D姿态跟踪实现精确操作。

Result: 在模拟和现实环境中均实现高成功率，并能长期稳定执行重复任务。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了高精度插入任务的鲁棒性和长期性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where
a robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a
nut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving
millimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple
repetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce
additional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a
reinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting
module. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather
than the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real
transferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages
real-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and
rotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential
execution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the
wrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high
one-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon
repetitive tasks.

Conclusion: SkyVLN为无人机在复杂城市环境中的自主导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as versatile tools across
various sectors, driven by their mobility and adaptability. This paper
introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation
(VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in
complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language
instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic
3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal
navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history
path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial
contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The
framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance,
ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our
approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using
AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success
rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在连续控制任务中数据需求大、长时规划难及安全性不足的问题，同时弥补MPC的局部最优解和成本函数设计复杂性。

Method: 整合贝叶斯MPC与Actor-Critic强化学习，利用SVGD直接优化控制序列，以Q值作为目标，无需显式设计成本函数。

Result: 在2D导航和机器人操作任务中，Q-STAC表现出更高的样本效率、鲁棒性和最优性。

Conclusion: Q-STAC成功结合了MPC的可解释性与强化学习的表达能力，实现了高效且安全的控制。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous
control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with
complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during
operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and
constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions
and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided
STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework
that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic
reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent
(SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values
as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while
leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure
control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D
navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves
superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of
policy distributions. Experiment videos are available on our website:

Motivation: 评估人形机器人的性能具有挑战性，传统成功率指标难以复现且无法捕捉运动轨迹的复杂性。

Conclusion: NeME提供了一种可复现、系统且深入的方法，用于比较复杂HRI任务中多模态模仿学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在单个GPU内动态分配资源以解耦预填充和解码阶段的方法，显著提高了吞吐量和降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预填充-解码（PD）解耦方法需要更多硬件资源，而分块预填充方法虽提高了GPU利用率，但引入了阶段干扰。论文旨在探索是否能在单个GPU内实现类似的解耦效果。

Method: 通过分析GPU资源的边际效益，动态分配单个GPU的资源给预填充和解码阶段，实现解耦。

Result: 系统Nexus在多种模型和负载下，吞吐量最高提升2.2倍，TTFT降低20倍，TBT降低2.5倍，且仅用一半GPU数量即可超越vLLM解耦方案。

Conclusion: 在单个GPU内动态分配资源可以有效解耦预填充和解码阶段，显著提升性能并减少硬件需求。

Abstract: Current prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation is typically deployed at the level
of entire serving engines, assigning separate GPUs to handle prefill and decode
phases. While effective at reducing latency, this approach demands more
hardware. To improve GPU utilization, Chunked Prefill mixes prefill and decode
requests within the same batch, but introduces phase interference between
prefill and decode.
  While existing PD disaggregation solutions separate the phases across GPUs,
we ask: can the same decoupling be achieved within a single serving engine? The
key challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource requirements of prefill
and decode when they share the same hardware. In this paper, we first show that
chunked prefill requests cause interference with decode requests due to their
distinct requirements for GPU resources. Second, we find that GPU resources
exhibit diminishing returns. Beyond a saturation point, increasing GPU
allocation yields negligible latency improvements. This insight enables us to
split a single GPU's resources and dynamically allocate them to prefill and
decode on the fly, effectively disaggregating the two phases within the same
GPU.
  Across a range of models and workloads, our system Nexus achieves up to 2.2x
higher throughput, 20x lower TTFT, and 2.5x lower TBT than vLLM. It also
outperforms SGLang with up to 2x higher throughput, 2x lower TTFT, and 1.7x
lower TBT, and achieves 1.4x higher throughput than vLLM-disaggregation using
only half the number of GPUs.

Conclusion: DeepRetro通过迭代LLM推理，展示了在复杂化学合成中推动技术前沿的潜力。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target
compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges
in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large
language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but
effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step
planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce
DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic
framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional
template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs
in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is
attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently
proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these
suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks
before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for
further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway
exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline
through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to
identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we
develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human
chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This
approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product
compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance
state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.

Conclusion: 该方法能够更有效地利用随机过程模型的频率信息，提升业务过程分析的准确性。

Abstract: Process mining leverages event data extracted from IT systems to generate
insights into the business processes of organizations. Such insights benefit
from explicitly considering the frequency of behavior in business processes,
which is captured by stochastic process models. Given an observed trace and a
stochastic process model, conventional alignment-based conformance checking
techniques face a fundamental limitation: They prioritize matching the trace to
a model path with minimal deviations, which may, however, lead to selecting an
unlikely path. In this paper, we study the problem of matching an observed
trace to a stochastic process model by identifying a likely model path with a
low edit distance to the trace. We phrase this as an optimization problem and
develop a heuristic-guided path-finding algorithm to solve it. Our open-source
implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and shows that it
can provide new, useful diagnostic insights for analysts.

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the
extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the
performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of
data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these
features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we
introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation
integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from
distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network,
self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach
yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single
representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate
the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset,
underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in
various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of
polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other
domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

Conclusion: Speckle2Self为超声斑点噪声去除提供了一种有效的自监督解决方案，适用于实际临床应用。

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.
