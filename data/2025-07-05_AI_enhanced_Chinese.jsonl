However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer.

In this\nwork, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the\nfeedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by\nPQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have\nprimarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the\nFFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,\nexpressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a\nresidual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating\nentanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured\nQFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its\nclassical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific\nparameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive\nedge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data\nefficiency.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal).

An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAIRES\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fGCN\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u7ed3\u5408GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3001GDS\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe1.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups.

I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the\nhighest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON\nrepresentation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid\nplan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task\n- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade\nperformance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from\nnatural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex\nproblems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will\ninevitably shift.

Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning\ncapabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,\nwhether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more\nvulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,\nsuggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype\nreinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those\nrelying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing\nattacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped\ninstructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently\nimproves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to\nreasoning design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RLMs\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CLEAR-Bias\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM-as-a-judge\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30RLMs\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CoT\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u6bd4\u65e0\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u504f\u89c1\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5bf9\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5fc5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u504f\u89c1\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes\nof model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend\nredundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to\nidentify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more\nconcise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that\nTH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%\non hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability.
