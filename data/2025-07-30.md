### [2] [Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065)
*Sabrina Patania,Luca Annese,Cansu Koyuturk,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了社会中介学习范式如何提升大语言模型（LLM）在线获取复杂知识的能力，通过AI社交健身房中的对话互动，发现混合方向教学策略显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练范式依赖大数据集和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力。受维果茨基社会文化理论启发，研究试图通过社会中介学习解决这一问题。

Method: 引入‘AI社交健身房’动态环境，学习者AI与教师AI进行教学对话，研究不同教学策略对本体知识获取的影响。

Result: 混合方向互动（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLM知识获取与应用能力，优于单向教学和直接访问结构化知识。

Conclusion: 将教学和心理洞察融入AI训练可显著提升知识获取与响应质量，为现有策略（如提示工程）提供补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

### [3] [Product vs. Process: Exploring EFL Students' Editing of AI-Generated Text for Expository Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21073)
*David James Woo,Yangyang Yu,Kai Guo,Yilin Huang,April Ka Yeng Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了EFL中学生如何编辑AI生成的文本，发现编辑行为对写作质量影响有限，AI支持但不替代写作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的文本在EFL写作中应用广泛，但其对学生写作过程和成文质量的影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用收敛设计分析39名香港中学生的屏幕录制和作文，结合定性编码、描述性统计、时间序列分析、人工评分和多元线性回归。

Result: 发现两种编辑模式，AI生成字数对评分有正面影响，但编辑行为对质量提升有限。

Conclusion: AI是辅助工具，需结合体裁教学和过程写作，评估应重视过程与成果。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

### [4] [Which symbol grounding problem should we try to solve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21080)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Floridi和Taddeo提出了解决基础问题的“零语义承诺”条件及其解决方案，但作者认为该条件无法实现，并建议重新思考问题本质及目标的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基础问题的解决方案是否可行，并提出对问题本质的新理解。

Method: 分析Floridi和Taddeo的条件及解决方案，对比Luc Steels的建议，结合对计算的理解重新定义问题。

Result: 认为唯一合理的基础问题是如何解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义基础问题，关注计算代理的行为能力和意义功能。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [5] [ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21083)
*Franck Bardol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4对情绪化问题的回答存在“反弹偏差”，倾向于过度纠正负面情绪，转向中立或积极。敏感话题中，这种效应更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（如GPT-4）如何因提问的情绪化表达而调整回答，揭示潜在的偏差。

Method: 通过系统性地改变156个提示的情绪语调（负面、中性、正面），分析模型回答的变化。使用“语调下限”和语调-情感转移矩阵量化行为。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回答概率比中性问题低三倍，敏感话题中语调变化被抑制。

Conclusion: 情绪化提示驱动了一类未被充分探索的偏差，对AI对齐和信任有重要影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are
available at: https://github.com/bardolfranck/llm-responses-viewer

### [6] [Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084)
*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MNEME框架，通过稀疏模型差异检测来识别LLM微调或遗忘后的副作用，无需微调数据即可预测行为变化，准确率达95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法检测LLM微调或遗忘后的不可预测副作用，如跨任务性能下降。

Method: MNEME框架通过稀疏模型差异比较基础模型和微调模型在任务无关数据上的行为变化。

Result: 在三种场景下，MNEME预测副作用的准确率高达95%，且无需定制启发式方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展的自动化工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [7] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多业余模型对比解码（MACD）方法，通过集成多个业余模型更全面地捕捉语言生成中的失败模式，提升了生成文本的流畅性、连贯性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比解码（CD）虽然能提升文本生成的流畅性和连贯性，但依赖单一业余模型限制了其对多样化失败模式的捕捉能力。

Method: MACD通过集成多个业余模型，结合平均和共识惩罚机制，扩展了对比信号，并在多业余模型设置中有效运行。

Result: 实验表明，MACD在多个领域（如新闻、百科和叙事）中均优于传统解码方法和原始CD方法。

Conclusion: MACD无需额外训练或微调，即可显著提升生成文本的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

### [8] [QU-NLP at CheckThat! 2025: Multilingual Subjectivity in News Articles Detection using Feature-Augmented Transformer Models with Sequential Cross-Lingual Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21095)
*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的方法，用于检测新闻句子中的主观性，并在多语言和零样本设置中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻句子中主观性与客观性检测的挑战，特别是在多语言环境下。

Method: 采用特征增强的Transformer架构，结合预训练模型（如AraELECTRA和DeBERTa~V3）与TF-IDF等特征，并通过门控机制优化。

Result: 在英语、阿拉伯语、德语等语言中表现优异，尤其在零样本设置中取得领先排名。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征与门控机制及跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，且模型对训练语言顺序和语言接近性敏感。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

### [9] [Rewrite-to-Rank: Optimizing Ad Visibility via Retrieval-Aware Text Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21099)
*Chloe Ho,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Diya Sharma,Tanvi Reddy Anumandla,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过LLM重写广告内容来提升其在检索系统中的排名和生成响应中的出现频率，提出了一种监督微调框架和两种评估指标，实验表明PPO训练模型优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索广告内容措辞对广告可见性的影响，尤其是在LLM集成检索系统中，如何通过重写广告提升其表现。

Method: 引入监督微调框架，结合语义相关性和内容保真度的自定义损失函数，提出DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K两种评估指标。

Result: PPO训练模型在指令提示和少样本提示中表现最佳，DeltaDIR@5提升2.79，DeltaMRR@5提升0.0073。

Conclusion: 广告措辞、提示格式和强化学习对LLM集成检索系统中的广告重写效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic sign language translation has gained particular interest in the
computer vision and computational linguistics communities in recent years.
Given each sign language country particularities, machine translation requires
local data to develop new techniques and adapt existing ones. This work
presents iLSU T, an open dataset of interpreted Uruguayan Sign Language RGB
videos with audio and text transcriptions. This type of multimodal and curated
data is paramount for developing novel approaches to understand or generate
tools for sign language processing. iLSU T comprises more than 185 hours of
interpreted sign language videos from public TV broadcasting. It covers diverse
topics and includes the participation of 18 professional interpreters of sign
language. A series of experiments using three state of the art translation
algorithms is presented. The aim is to establish a baseline for this dataset
and evaluate its usefulness and the proposed pipeline for data processing. The
experiments highlight the need for more localized datasets for sign language
translation and understanding, which are critical for developing novel tools to
improve accessibility and inclusion of all individuals. Our data and code can
be accessed.

### [11] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种工具，用于客观测量阿拉伯语修辞在文本中的密度，填补了现有领域缺乏量化方法的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语修辞学缺乏客观的量化方法，无法比较不同文本、作者或时代的修辞使用情况。

Method: 研究者编制了84种常见修辞手法的清单，开发了识别和计算修辞密度的工具，包括电子和模拟工具。

Result: 成功创建了一个能够准确报告阿拉伯语文本修辞密度的工具。

Conclusion: 该工具为阿拉伯语修辞学提供了量化分析的新方法，有助于跨文本和时代的比较研究。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

### [12] [Curved Inference: Concern-Sensitive Geometry in Large Language Model Residual Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21107)
*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种几何可解释性框架Curved Inference，用于分析大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的残差流轨迹弯曲情况。通过实验发现，模型内部激活轨迹会随关注强度变化，揭示了语义抽象和模型对齐的新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解大型语言模型如何在不同语义关注下调整其内部激活轨迹，从而揭示模型的语义抽象和对齐机制。

Method: 方法包括使用几何指标（如曲率和显著性）分析Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型在20个不同语义领域的提示下的响应，并通过解嵌入矩阵的语义度量确保测量与令牌对齐的几何结构相关。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLaMA模型在关注强度增加时曲率和显著性显著提升，而Gemma模型对关注的响应较弱。结果支持了LLM几何的两层结构观点。

Conclusion: 结论表明Curved Inference为诊断模型对齐和语义抽象提供了新方法，揭示了模型在深度上如何导航和强化语义意义。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

Result: 在MultiHop RAG和Wikipedia数据集上表现优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供了一种高效、准确的领域特定LLM解决方案，具有可持续性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了NLP在保险业中的应用，展示了如何将非结构化文本转化为结构化数据以支持精算分析和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着InsurTech的兴起，传统保险公司需要利用替代数据源和先进技术保持竞争力。

Method: 通过实际案例研究，应用多种NLP技术处理非结构化文本，并与传统保险数据结合。

Result: NLP不仅补充了传统评级因素，还提供了新的行业分类视角，增强了风险评估能力。

Conclusion: NLP是现代数据驱动保险分析的基础工具，而不仅仅是补充。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的广泛应用，领域特定安全性和合规性评估变得至关重要，但现有研究多关注性能提升而忽视安全性。

Method: 基于医学、法律和金融领域的伦理准则定义领域特定安全原则，并开发Trident-Bench基准，评估19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）能满足基本要求，而领域专用模型在伦理细节上表现不佳，凸显领域特定安全改进的迫切需求。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为研究法律和金融领域的大语言模型安全性提供了系统资源，并为未来减少安全风险的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Conclusion: Inworld TTS-1系列模型在语音合成质量和效率上表现优异，且开源了代码。

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built

compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and
RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech
with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control
and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source
our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何有效利用多样性提升LLMs在二元问题上的性能。

Method: 对比模型多样性和问题解释多样性，采用多数投票作为集成共识策略。

Result: 问题解释多样性在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa上表现更优；模型多样性结果介于最佳和最差集成成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

TL;DR: StructText是一个自动生成高质量基准的框架，用于从文本中提取键值对，利用现有表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过多维度评估策略确保文本与结构化数据的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估大型语言模型（LLM）在特定领域或组织文档中提取质量的基准，手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: StructText采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过LLM判断和客观提取指标进行多维度评估。

Result: 在71,539个示例上的评估显示，LLM在事实准确性上表现良好，但在叙事连贯性上存在困难，数值和时间信息提取准确性高但难以嵌入可提取的叙述中。

Conclusion: StructText为键值提取研究提供了框架、数据集和评估工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释仍具挑战性，现有激活归因方法易受类别无关特征影响，导致解释不可靠，限制了其在实际应用中的可信度和安全性。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列激活与参考激活，过滤类别无关特征，优化令牌级归因。

Result: 实验表明，Contrast-CAT在多数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，在MoRF设置下AOPC和LOdds指标分别提升1.30倍和2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT显著提升了Transformer文本分类模型的解释性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

Method: 使用新构建的28,528条孟加拉语评论数据集，采用XLM-RoBERTa Base架构的Transformer模型进行分类，并结合可解释AI技术分析关键特征。

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并能识别驱动情感分类的关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理低资源语言（如孟加拉语）方面表现优异，可为公共政策制定和犯罪预防提供实用见解。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

Result: Bangla BERT在试验数据中表现优异，准确率达95.65%，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，Transformer模型也能有效提升分类性能，为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床理由的额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性。结果显示，在高资源场景下临床理由能提升性能，但在资源有限时效果不一致，且不如直接使用更多报告数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索临床理由作为额外监督是否能提升模型性能和可解释性，以优化临床文本分类任务。

Method: 分析了99,125条人类临床理由和128,649份电子病理报告，评估Transformer模型在提取原发癌症部位时的表现，并研究充分性作为理由质量的预选指标。

Result: 临床理由在高资源场景下能提升性能，但资源有限时效果不稳定；使用充分性预选理由结果不一致；模型在理由训练下表现不如直接使用更多报告数据。

Conclusion: 临床理由作为额外训练数据仅带来小幅性能提升和略好的可解释性，优化准确性应优先标注更多报告而非生成理由。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德观的差异与相似性，以解决其训练数据中可能存在的偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德评分方差、进行聚类对齐分析、以及通过系统性选择的词对直接测试模型。

Result: LLMs未能完全复现跨文化道德差异，倾向于压缩差异且与调查数据对齐度低。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs的文化代表性和偏见缓解方法，强调公平和伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的网页历史压缩方法，通过压缩历史状态中的任务相关信息，提升网页自动化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页自动化方法忽视了历史状态的重要性，且冗长的网页状态导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏，影响历史状态的有效利用。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，将每个历史状态中最相关的任务信息提取为固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上的实验表明，该方法比无历史输入的基线方法准确率提高了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 通过压缩历史状态，显著提升了网页自动化的性能。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种模式：自主代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式。实验表明，不同模式在工具移除效率和任务完成准确性上表现各异。


<details>

Motivation: 解决固定上下文窗口在多轮交互中限制工具重复独立使用的问题。

Method: 提出MemTool框架，包含三种代理架构：自主代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式，并在ScaleMCP基准上评估其性能。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型模型上工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中型模型效率低（0-60%）。工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现稳定，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了灵活的模式选择，需根据任务准确性、代理能力和模型性能权衡使用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

TL;DR: HumorBench是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）在理解和解释卡通字幕中复杂幽默能力的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型在数学和科学领域的基准测试逐渐饱和，需要在非STEM领域开发新颖且具有挑战性的评估方法。幽默理解涉及复杂的推理能力。

Method: HumorBench包含约300个来自New Yorker Caption Contest和Cartoonstock.com的卡通-字幕对，专家标注了关键幽默元素。LLM通过解释幽默和识别幽默元素的能力进行评估。

Result: 测试发现：（1）LLM在STEM推理上的进步能有效转移到幽默理解；（2）仅基于STEM数据训练的模型在HumorBench上表现良好；（3）增加思考令牌预算对幽默推理的效果因模型而异。

Conclusion: HumorBench为评估LLM在非STEM领域的推理能力提供了新工具，展示了推理能力的可转移性。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务多样性的数据选择方法，用于高效标注的监督微调，显著优于现有基于提示多样性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调中标注成本高的问题，利用任务多样性和预训练模型的置信度差异。

Result: 在MMLU任务上准确率提升4%，标注成本降低80%。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和成本上均优于现有方法，适用于标注预算有限的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决越南缺乏大规模多样化测试数据集的问题，以支持嵌入模型的有效评估和实际应用。

Method: 通过自动化框架翻译英文样本，结合LLM和嵌入模型进行翻译和过滤，保留高质量样本，涵盖41个越南文本嵌入任务数据集。

Result: 发现使用Rotary Positional Embedding的更大更复杂模型在嵌入任务中表现优于Absolute Positional Embedding模型。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南文本嵌入任务提供了高质量基准，支持模型评估和优化。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

Motivation: 尽管助手模型通常被训练为有益、无害和诚实，但有时会偏离这些目标。研究旨在识别和控制这些偏离。

Result: 发现人格向量能有效预测和控制训练后的人格变化，并可通过干预或预防方法避免不良变化。

Conclusion: 人格向量提供了一种自动化方法来监测和调整模型行为，适用于任何感兴趣的人格特质。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Token Map Drafting的无模型推测解码技术，用于加速基于Transformer的自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，同时保持转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码技术需要额外的草稿模型，不适合缺乏硬件加速器的设备。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预计算的n-gram token map替代草稿模型，实现高效的推测解码。

Result: 在CI-AVSR和内部数据集上分别实现了1.27倍和1.37倍的解码加速，且未降低准确性。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种适用于资源受限设备的有效方法，显著提升了ASR推理速度。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种无需训练的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层使用三角形稀疏模式，显著减少计算开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）中注意力机制因输入序列长度增加而导致的二次时间复杂度和计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出TriangleMix，浅层使用密集注意力，深层切换为三角形稀疏模式。

Result: 在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不影响精度。

Conclusion: TriangleMix能高效提升LLM推理效率，并可与其他动态稀疏方法结合进一步加速。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP技术在需求工程中的应用日益广泛，但缺乏对NLP4RE研究的复现，因此通过复现和扩展研究以增强外部有效性。

Method: 复现了基线研究的深度学习模型，并在外部数据集上评估性能，同时比较了GPT-4o零样本分类器。

Result: 不同模型的复现性各异，BERT和ELMo在外部数据集上表现良好，GPT-4o性能与传统模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基线研究的可复现性，并提供了缺失的环境设置文件以支持未来复现。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Motivation: 解决维吾尔语这一低资源、黏着语在自然语言处理中的资源不足问题，并克服现有树库的局限性。

Method: 设计了包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 实验显示标注差异达47.9%，表明通用方案无法处理维吾尔语特有结构。

Conclusion: 提出的现代维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）提供了更准确、语义透明的表示，为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有研究知识冲突的基准存在局限性，如局限于问答设置、依赖实体替换技术及冲突类型有限。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱的框架，生成多样且微妙的冲突，确保可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳，且难以定位矛盾来源。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs整合多样化（甚至冲突）信息的能力提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否能复制人类对复杂语言现象（形态模式）的敏感性。

Method: 使用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在三种频率条件下的表现：自然、低频和高频分布。

Result: 模型在准确性上优于人类，但反应偏好不同；模型受训练数据中不规则动词比例影响，且对音韵相似性敏感。

Conclusion: 模型与人类在语言处理上存在差异，需进一步研究其认知合理性。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

Motivation: 教师模型的输出分布包含丰富信息，而传统束搜索方法仅提供近似模式，限制了学生模型的学习潜力。

Method: 利用束搜索的n-best列表生成多个翻译，增加目标侧前缀的多样性，并尝试其他解码方法以解决低频词代表性不足的问题。

Result: 对低资源语言，采样方法虽略微降低翻译质量，但增加了多样性和词汇丰富性，提升了学生模型性能并减少了性别偏见。

Conclusion: MHD方法通过多假设蒸馏有效提升了学生模型的学习效果，尤其在低资源语言中表现显著。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法有效解决了奖励模型在复杂推理中的局限性，为推理能力的持续提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注过滤安全提示，而忽视了那些总是引发有害输出的硬提示。UnsafeChain填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示及其纠正后的安全响应，并对三个LRMs进行微调。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中表现优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: UnsafeChain展示了基于纠正的监督方法的有效性和泛化能力，同时提升了模型的安全性而不损害推理能力。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在自然语言处理中取得显著进展，但对对抗攻击的脆弱性限制了其在实际应用中的鲁棒性。现有方法通常计算成本高。

Method: 提出一种附加模块，通过移除实例级主成分并近似高斯特性来转换嵌入空间，减少对抗扰动的敏感性，同时保留语义关系。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的嵌入空间转换，有效提升了PLMs的对抗鲁棒性，且无需高昂的计算成本或对抗样本。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Conclusion: AgriEval为农业领域LLM的评估和改进提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多语言环境下大型语言模型（LLMs）安全分类器的有效性及评估数据集的潜在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs安全分类器的多语言差异和评估数据集的不足，以改进有害内容的识别方法。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的数据集，评估5种安全分类模型的多语言表现。

Result: 发现多语言差异和评估数据集的问题，指出安全分类器的不足不仅源于模型本身。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于推动多语言环境下LLM输入有害内容识别的改进。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics
from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework
mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both
abstract intents and precise visual details. Our toolkit demonstrates
converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting
its flexibility, expressiveness, and practical applicability.

TL;DR: HRIPBench评估大语言模型（LLM）在减少毒品危害信息提供中的准确性和安全性，发现现有模型仍存在严重风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在减少毒品危害信息提供中的表现，以确保其安全性。

Method: 构建HRIPBench基准数据集（2,160个问答对），涵盖三个任务，并采用Instruction和RAG方案评估模型行为。

Result: 当前最先进的LLM在提供准确信息方面表现不佳，且可能带来严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少毒品危害的语境中使用LLM需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理和幻觉检测等任务至关重要，例如区分朋友间的“温和讽刺”与不友善行为。

Method: 使用句子Transformer和基于Transformer的模型（如RoBERTa）对ADEPT挑战基准中的16K英语句子对进行建模实验。

Result: 句子Transformer和基于Transformer的模型在此任务上表现不佳，句子Transformer甚至不如RoBERTa。评估方法的不平衡会扭曲模型性能和结果可信度。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的方法，但现有模型在捕捉事件合理性变化方面仍有挑战，强调了平衡评估的重要性。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在自动化编码中的表现差异，减少试错实践，提供可靠的提示构建方法。

Method: 提出HALC流程，通过1,512个提示和两百万次请求测试不同策略，基于专家编码（ground truth）评估性能。

Result: 找到可靠提示，单变量编码一致性（αclimate = .76；αmovement = .78）和双变量（αclimate = .71；αmovement = .74）。

Conclusion: HALC为不同任务和模型提供了有效提示策略，减少试错，提升编码可靠性。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个基于强化学习的框架，使LLM能自主决定是否及何时调用外部工具，优化任务正确性和工具使用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成方法依赖静态策略，可能损害语言模型的核心能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，因此需要更灵活的方法。

Method: AutoTIR采用强化学习框架，结合任务正确性、结构化输出和工具使用惩罚的混合奖励机制。

Result: AutoTIR在多种任务中表现优异，显著优于基线方法，并展现出更好的工具使用泛化能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习有望为LLM构建通用且可扩展的工具集成能力，AutoTIR展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过端到端强化学习改进GraphRAG，解决了传统方法的高构建成本、固定检索和长上下文依赖问题，提升了推理准确性和检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GraphRAG方法存在高构建成本、固定检索和依赖长上下文推理的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Graph-R1框架，采用轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统GraphRAG和RL增强方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习显著提升了GraphRAG的性能，为知识增强生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨死记硬背是否阻碍泛化，并验证LLMs能否通过死记硬背数据实现泛化。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 用无意义符号死记硬背事实关联；2) 通过少量语义提示微调实现泛化。

Result: 8个LLMs实验显示，模型能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化语义对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 死记硬背数据可被重新解释为泛化知识，但需警惕恶意利用风险。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

Motivation: 探讨AI语言模型在温暖性和可靠性之间的权衡，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时的表现。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率上显著增加（+10到+30个百分点），更容易传播阴谋论、提供错误信息或不当医疗建议，并更倾向于验证用户的错误信念。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法可能无法检测到这些系统性风险，需要重新思考如何开发和监督这些重塑人际关系的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

Motivation: 解决LLM在推理密集型任务中答案校准不佳的问题，模仿人类在没有外部反馈时的学习方式。

Method: 通过模型的自我反馈（RLSF），利用其生成的链式思考解决方案的置信度排名，进行偏好优化。

Result: RLSF改善了模型的概率估计校准，并增强了逐步推理能力，在算术推理和选择题任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RLSF证明了利用模型内在行为进行强化学习的有效性，为LLM后训练提供了数据高效的新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨文化食谱适应中，RAG方法虽然能结合检索和生成，但缺乏多样性输出，无法满足多用户需求。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，优化RAG的检索和上下文组织，以生成更多样化的食谱适应结果。

Result: 实验表明，CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上优于封闭式LLMs，达到帕累托效率。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求高多样性输出的RAG框架，有效解决了跨文化食谱适应中的多样性问题。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

Motivation: 解决传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中泛化能力不足的问题，尤其是在小样本或异构标签格式的情况下。

Method: 评估了多种LLMs（如ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等）在零样本和少样本设置下的性能，并与随机森林等传统模型进行比较。

Result: LLMs在分类和污染风险预测中表现优于基线模型，并能泛化到不同地点和元数据分布。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种有前景的元数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Motivation: 解决现有RAG方法在查询和源端控制不足导致的噪声检索和浅层推理问题。

Result: 在多跳QA任务中，相比传统RAG方法，推理深度、检索精度和可解释性均有提升。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化和透明设计，显著提升了RAG的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释性方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，结合信心量化和上下文继承，实现结构化沟通。

Result: 通过实证验证，SynLang成功展示了AI对结构化推理协议的适应能力及元认知干预。

Conclusion: SynLang与共生认识论结合，通过双层次透明性增强人类智能，同时保持人类自主权和伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of

### [61] [Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Synthea Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21123)
*Mark A. Kramer,Aanchal Mathur,Caroline E. Adams,Jason A. Walonoski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLM）辅助开发Synthea（开源合成健康数据生成器）的新疾病模块，以减少开发时间、降低专业需求、增加模型多样性并提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLM辅助开发Synthea疾病模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛并提升合成数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLM支持方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLM在模块开发中展现出潜力，但也存在需人工监督、严格测试及内容准确性等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究以充分发挥LLM在合成数据生成中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的内部机制，超越传统任务性能指标，探索模型如何处理信息。

Method: 引入任务无关的“认知剖面”方法，基于熵衰减曲线和IGS指数分析模型的信息处理动态。

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知剖面，这些剖面对模型规模和文本复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: 为分析和比较人工智能的内在操作动态提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知的学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人机协作决策系统的动态对齐优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将对齐视为静态或事后属性，NPO旨在通过可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失实现动态对齐。

Method: NPO提出对齐损失的形式化定义，并引入元对齐概念，通过阈值保真度实现监控过程的优化。实现包括场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和结构化反馈处理。

Result: 在随机反馈下，NPO证明了对齐损失和监控保真度的收敛性，并在大规模部署中显示出实际价值。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监控提供了紧凑且可检查的架构，将理论对齐保证与动态环境中的实际可靠性相结合。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险生活建议中的问题，包括谄媚和过度自信，并通过实验提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险建议中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，亟需研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三个实验：(1) 多选评估模型稳定性；(2) 自由回答分析；(3) 机制可解释性实验，通过激活向量控制模型行为。

Result: 部分模型表现谄媚，但如o4-mini等模型稳健；高安全分模型常提问而非直接建议；激活向量可控制模型谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，激活向量控制为安全对齐提供新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Motivation: 研究不同数独网站对难度评级的定义差异，提出一种通用的难度评估方法。

Method: 1. 将数独转换为SAT问题，提取结构复杂度指标；2. 模拟人类解法，统计策略使用次数。

Result: 提出的指标与网站标注难度强相关，通用评级系统在4/5网站上表现良好。

Conclusion: 构建的通用评级系统能跨网站一致地分类数独难度，并提供了初学者解法算法。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并可靠地抑制大型语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 为55个有害子概念学习线性探针，构建有害子空间，并通过子空间的主导方向进行引导和消融。

Result: 主导方向引导能几乎消除有害性，同时对模型实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解和调控语言模型行为提供了可扩展的工具，有助于未来模型的审计和加固。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以在高压力环境中促进人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景（如应急响应）中，快速信任对有效的人机协作至关重要，但现有XAI方法通常提供统一解释且依赖显式反馈，不适用于高压环境。

Method: 提出AXTF框架，利用生理和行为信号（如EEG、ECG和眼动追踪）推断用户状态，并通过多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF能够非侵入性地响应用户状态，提供个性化解释支持，从而增强高压环境中的快速信任。

Conclusion: AXTF为开发适应高压、时间敏感环境的自适应XAI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作方法缺乏明确的组件选择规则，依赖预定义集群，部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳，需改进协作能力。

Method: 采用自多样性（计算LLM内部输出的模糊匹配值）和跨一致性（逐步剔除一致性低的LLM）机制优化LLM集群。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，如NEJMQA上Obstetrics and Gynecology学科准确率达65.47%，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 自适应集群协作方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的性能，尤其在专业领域表现突出。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Conclusion: 本文提出的LLM驱动方法为ADN调度提供了一种高效、用户友好的解决方案，降低了技术门槛并提升了调度效率。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能够系统性地组合解释复杂问题，并将其映射为SPARQL查询。

Method: 生成三个基于DBpedia图模式的数据集，使用Lemon词汇进行语言化，通过不同提示和优化技术测试LLM。

Result: 随着问题复杂性增加，LLM的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，表明其组合解释能力有限。

Conclusion: LLM在系统性和组合性解释复杂问题方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

*Yufei Li,Zexin Li,Yinglun Zhu,Cong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeMix系统通过联合调度LLM的推理和训练任务，显著提升了资源利用率和响应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合调度，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Result: 微调LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其问题更有效。

Conclusion: 该编码助手能生成更准确和有用的代码响应，优于基线模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更可靠的问答系统提供了重要进展，但仍需解决信息可信度区分和系统延迟与全面性平衡的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Result: 实验模拟显示，基于TA原则的智能体在互动中表现更深层次且情境感知更强。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和社交心理学研究等应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具显著提升任务效率和准确性，标注者技能是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

Motivation: 供应链管理面临需求波动、库存不平衡和牛鞭效应等挑战，传统方法难以应对动态市场条件，而现有机器学习方法存在计算复杂性和训练效率等问题。液态神经网络因其适应性和低计算成本成为潜在解决方案，但其在供应链优化中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究引入了一种混合LNN和XGBoost的模型，利用LNN的动态特征提取能力和XGBoost的全局优化能力，优化多级供应链的订单策略。

Result: 该模型旨在减少牛鞭效应并提高累积利润，同时满足供应链管理中对适应性和效率的双重需求。

Conclusion: 提出的混合模型填补了现有方法的空白，为动态和高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，影响问题解决质量。

Method: 设计了一个生成部分指定任务的框架，采用强化微调策略，奖励能获取隐含信息的提问。

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于o3-mini 18%，人类评估中其提问和输出更受青睐。

Conclusion: 主动澄清能提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任模型输出对大型语言模型的对齐至关重要。现有方法（如语义熵）通过设定阈值衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 开发了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量方法，扩展了现有阈值方法，并满足三个基本性质。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性比基线方法更准确地预测模型表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性为衡量模型输出可靠性提供了更精细的框架。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.

Method: 提出双解码器框架，一个生成本体编辑候选，另一个生成自然语言解释，通过动态注意力门控机制协调两者。

Result: 在医疗本体优化、语义搜索改进等用例中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD结合符号和神经推理，为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Conclusion: 结合CPIC和PharmGKB的RAG技术能显著提升AI性能，Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为红外光谱分析提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，尤其在低数据条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Motivation: 随着人类与AI系统的协作需求增加，开发能准确模拟个体决策的AI变得重要。国际象棋作为测试平台，现有方法需大量个体数据，不适用于新用户或数据稀疏场景。

Method: Maia4All采用两阶段优化：1) 通过原型增强模型连接群体与个体行为建模；2) 利用能力水平或用户原型初始化并优化个体嵌入。

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模设定了新标准，其原型增强模型方法可扩展至其他领域，如个性化LLMs。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在面对视觉不可回答问题时的诚实行为，构建了大规模基准测试MoHoBench，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在面对不可回答问题时可能产生有害或不诚实内容，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，评估了28种MLLMs的诚实性，并尝试了监督学习和偏好学习对齐方法。

Result: 大多数模型在需要拒绝回答时表现不佳，且诚实性不仅与语言建模相关，还受视觉信息影响。初步对齐方法显示改进潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为未来可信MLLMs的发展提供了基准和方法基础，强调了多模态诚实对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一套精确标准，用于定义神经网络如何学习和使用“世界模型”，旨在为实验研究提供共同语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为常用但非正式的术语提供操作化定义，促进实验研究。

Result: 定义了一套标准，确保“世界模型”非平凡且有意义。

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供了可操作的定义框架，尤其关注世界状态的潜在表示。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体舞蹈生成在影视、游戏和动画制作中有广泛应用，但现有方法难以处理多舞者间的密集时空交互，导致扩展性和碰撞问题。

Method: 采用轻量级图卷积进行距离感知的空间建模，以及加速稀疏注意力机制进行高效时间建模。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance优于现有方法，尤其在生成长且连贯的群体舞蹈序列时表现突出。

Conclusion: ST-GDance通过解耦时空依赖，显著提升了群体舞蹈生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and
adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming
wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core
communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance
versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional
methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities,
including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and
self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法有助于提升非专家用户对AI的理解和信任。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Motivation: 解决音频-视觉多任务增量学习中如何保留旧任务知识并促进新任务学习的挑战。

Method: PHP方法分为三个阶段：浅层阶段设计任务共享模态聚合适配器；中层阶段提出任务特定模态共享动态生成适配器；深层阶段引入任务特定模态独立提示。

Result: 在四个任务（AVE、AVVP、AVS和AVQA）的不同顺序中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PHP方法通过三阶段设计有效平衡了知识共享与任务特异性，实现了高性能的多任务增量学习。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 可读决策在多智能体团队协作中具有显著优势，能够提升团队整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人事管理提供了稳健、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Motivation: LVLMs在安全性上存在漏洞，研究旨在理解其内部机制并提出改进方法。

Method: 定义三种能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），提出SASA技术，通过线性探测检测风险。

Result: SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种有效的增强LVLMs安全性的方法，无需微调即可实现。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full

Motivation: 传统动态规划方法在状态-动作空间大或涉及长期依赖时计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，利用图信号处理重新参数化，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以更少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可迁移且统一的策略与值迭代表示方法，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP有效解决了跨数据集个体脑区分割的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Motivation: 探索描述逻辑ALC及其片段的有界拟合问题，填补现有学习算法在概率保证方面的不足。

Method: 基于SAT求解器实现有界拟合，并讨论优化方法。

Result: 证明了有界拟合问题对所有研究的片段均为NP完全，且其他学习算法无法提供类似的概率保证。

Conclusion: 有界拟合在描述逻辑学习中具有理论优势，并通过SAT求解器实现验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Conclusion: 该研究为工业应用中RAG系统的评估协议提供了可靠性和可扩展性的提升方案。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk
sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is
particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document
corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical
contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This
study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed
citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI)
method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems
evaluation protocols in industrial applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合条件变分因果推断模型（MCVCI）和混合条件变分因果聚类方法（MCVCC），用于推断异质性因果关系，并在模拟和真实数据上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异质性因果关系，而现有基于加性噪声的方法仅使用单一因果机制，无法有效处理此类数据。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型和神经网络的拟合能力，利用混合条件变分自编码器的概率边界似然作为因果决策标准，并进一步提出MCVCC方法以揭示因果机制表达。

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据集上，所提方法表现出优于现有技术的综合性能。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC方法有效解决了异质性因果推断问题，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种结合SDE和ODE的混合采样策略，通过滑动窗口机制优化MDP流程，显著提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FlowGRPO等方法在图像生成中对所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化的低效问题。

Method: 引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销。

Result: MixGRPO在人类偏好对齐中表现优异，训练时间减少近50%，MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口设计，显著提升了效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务驱动的业务流程设计在动态工业环境中缺乏灵活性和上下文感知能力，因此需要一种更智能的方法。

Method: 采用基于代理的方法，代理通过协作实现业务目标，当单个代理无法完成目标时，多个代理合并协作。

Result: 该方法实现了模块化和智能化的业务流程开发，适应动态工业环境。

Conclusion: 基于代理的方法为业务流程设计提供了更灵活和上下文感知的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DualSG框架，将大语言模型（LLM）作为语义指导模块，而非独立预测器，通过显式语义指导提升多变量时间序列预测（MTSF）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM作为端到端预测器会导致数值精度损失，或试图对齐文本和时间序列模态但面临对齐困难。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，引入时间序列描述（Time Series Caption）作为显式提示格式，并设计基于描述的融合模块。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合数值预测与语义指导能有效提升MTSF性能。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Motivation: 现有目标识别方法通常将观察者视为被动推理者，而AGR旨在通过主动收集信息减少不确定性。

Method: 采用概率框架，结合联合信念更新和MCTS算法，无需领域特定知识即可高效推断目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统的目标推断提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案，推动了交互性和适应性更强的系统发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法成功缓解优势崩溃问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过联合编辑多模态数据，有效解决了自动驾驶系统中的长尾分布问题，提升了感知模型的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Conclusion: 该框架为图数据提供了一种强大的神经符号方法，结合了学习和推理能力，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Motivation: GitHub仓库的README文件内容不完整可能影响其使用和推广，研究旨在通过自动化工具提升其分类和利用率。

Method: 微调三种预训练LLMs（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa），使用4226个README文件片段的数据集，并尝试参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）。

Result: 方法优于现有技术，F1分数达0.98，且参数高效微调在性能损失较小的情况下更经济。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动分类README文件内容，为GitHub仓库提供高效工具，提升其识别和潜在使用价值。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

*Sourish Gunesh Dhekane,Thomas Ploetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自然语言嵌入的零样本人类活动识别方法，避免了依赖LLM的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的零样本HAR方法在隐私、依赖性和一致性方面的问题。

Method: 利用自然语言建模传感器数据和活动，通过嵌入进行零样本分类。

Result: 在六个数据集上进行了详细案例研究，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言建模可以增强零样本HAR系统，无需依赖LLM。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行移动网络中的根因分析（RCA），并通过两阶段训练方法提升模型的准确性和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络中的根因分析（RCA）需要可解释性、领域专业知识和因果推理，现有开源推理LLMs在此任务上表现不佳，因此需要领域特定的适应方法。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，并引入TeleLogs数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个LLM规模上均显著优于现有推理和非推理模型，并能泛化到随机测试变体。

Conclusion: 领域适应和推理增强的LLMs在移动网络RCA中具有实际应用潜力，提升了可解释性和有效性。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold huge potential for usage in the
medical domain, but their computational costs necessitate efficient compression
techniques. This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and
activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical
applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze
different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a
prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B

TL;DR: PHAX框架通过结构化论证生成面向不同健康利益相关者的人类中心解释，提升AI在公共卫生中的透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法缺乏对不同健康利益相关者的适应性和结构性，需要更清晰、上下文相关且社会可问责的解释。

Method: PHAX结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知、受众特定的解释。

Result: PHAX在医学术语简化、医患沟通和政策论证等用例中展示了其适用性，提升了可解释性和信任。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了公共卫生中透明、人类中心AI的发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计困境、奖励无效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 1) 提出连续奖励函数；2) 引入“简单思考”奖励；3) 采用裁剪重采样策略；4) 推理阶段使用分解定位选择方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，定位精度提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架有效提升了GUI代理的性能，为多模态大语言模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench是一个用户为中心的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在多轮、偏好驱动的交互中的表现，发现现有模型在用户意图对齐和偏好挖掘方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达目标时，与用户的主动协作能力不足，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入UserBench基准，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具决策。

Result: 评估显示，模型仅20%的时间完全对齐用户意图，最先进模型主动挖掘的用户偏好不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了重要工具，揭示了现有模型在用户对齐方面的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query
decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses.
Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统主要关注准确性，而忽略了公平性和多样性。FedFlex旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合SVD和BPR矩阵分解算法，并应用MMR重新排序以增强多样性。

Result: 实验表明，FedFlex能引入多样内容（如新类型）而不降低用户满意度。

Conclusion: FedFlex在联邦推荐系统中有效平衡了多样性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative
model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has
shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and
personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated
recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with
limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce
FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series
recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization
algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive
experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a
live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List
A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.
Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in
watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse
content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily
compromising user satisfaction.

Abstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures
comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each
trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features.
While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges
including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited
personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item
content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new
paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native
mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged
to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of
LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,
illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,
and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.
LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate
effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external
knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven
architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of
conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for
understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal
is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but
foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and
user-centric recommender systems

Conclusion: 跨域推荐方法在艺术治疗中具有潜力，音乐驱动的偏好获取能显著提升个性化推荐效果。

Abstract: Art Therapy (AT) is an established practice that facilitates emotional
processing and recovery through creative expression. Recently, Visual Art
Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) have emerged to support AT, demonstrating their
potential by personalizing therapeutic artwork recommendations. Nonetheless,
current VA RecSys rely on visual stimuli for user modeling, limiting their
ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional responses during preference
elicitation. Previous studies have shown that music stimuli elicit unique
affective reflections, presenting an opportunity for cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) to enhance personalization in AT. Since CDR has not yet
been explored in this context, we propose a family of CDR methods for AT based
on music-driven preference elicitation. A large-scale study with 200 users
demonstrates the efficacy of music-driven preference elicitation, outperforming
the classic visual-only elicitation approach. Our source code, data, and models
are available at https://github.com/ArtAICare/Affect-aware-CDR

Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a
crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated
methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented
Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for
automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based
validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation
alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is
designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678
research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended
Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by
RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and
structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a
gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been
curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on
Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a
comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly
outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise

Method: 开发了一个高效的数据收集框架，利用并行计算和高级爬虫技术分析YouTube推荐算法，比较短视频和长视频的推荐行为。

Result: 发现短视频推荐算法更倾向于推送即时吸引但多样性较低的内容，且在政治敏感话题中存在明显的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计公平透明推荐系统的重要性，呼吁在数字媒体领域实施负责任的AI实践。

Abstract: The growing popularity of short-form video content, such as YouTube Shorts,
has transformed user engagement on digital platforms, raising critical
questions about the role of recommendation algorithms in shaping user
experiences. These algorithms significantly influence content consumption, yet
concerns about biases, echo chambers, and content diversity persist. This study
develops an efficient data collection framework to analyze YouTube's
recommendation algorithms for both short-form and long-form videos, employing
parallel computing and advanced scraping techniques to overcome limitations of
YouTube's API. The analysis uncovers distinct behavioral patterns in
recommendation algorithms across the two formats, with short-form videos
showing a more immediate shift toward engaging yet less diverse content
compared to long-form videos. Furthermore, a novel investigation into biases in
politically sensitive topics, such as the South China Sea dispute, highlights
the role of these algorithms in shaping narratives and amplifying specific
viewpoints. By providing actionable insights for designing equitable and
transparent recommendation systems, this research underscores the importance of
responsible AI practices in the evolving digital media landscape.

Method: 采用数据增强、多模态检索增强生成（RAG）、重排序和多任务微调等方法，每个任务使用单一模型。

Result: 在三个任务中分别获得自动评估的第3、第3和第1名，并在Task3的人类评估中获得第二名。

Conclusion: BlackPearl团队的解决方案在CRAG-MM挑战赛中表现优异，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have improved multi-modal understanding
and visual question answering (VQA), but still suffer from hallucinated
answers. Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps address these
issues by incorporating external information, yet challenges remain in visual
context comprehension, multi-source retrieval, and multi-turn interactions. To
address these challenges, Meta constructed the CRAG-MM benchmark and launched
the CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, which consists of three tasks. This
paper describes the solutions of all tasks in Meta KDD Cup'25 from BlackPearl
team. We use a single model for each task, with key methods including data
augmentation, RAG, reranking, and multi-task fine-tuning. Our solution achieve
automatic evaluation rankings of 3rd, 3rd, and 1st on the three tasks, and win
second place in Task3 after human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中因用户-物品交互数据稀疏导致的性能下降和流行度偏差问题。

Method: 利用LLMs和物品文本描述，通过少样本提示和多数投票生成合成交互数据，并将其整合到图对比学习框架中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了准确性并减少了流行度偏差，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效缓解了数据稀疏性和流行度偏差，为推荐系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语义信息构建知识图谱的新方法，利用ChatGPT分析电影描述并提取语气，显著提高了推荐系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电影行业推荐系统需要更个性化的建议以提高用户参与度和满意度，而基于知识的技术和语义分析能提供更合适的结果。

Method: 使用ChatGPT作为大型语言模型，分析电影描述并提取语气，构建知识图谱。

Result: 提出的方法比使用出版商提供的显式类型显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 基于语义信息的知识图谱方法能有效提升推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the
explicit genres supplied by the publishers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统过度专业化问题，避免用户陷入信息茧房，促进偶然发现。

Method: 采用句子嵌入和动态阈值聚类算法，构建内容空间结构化表示，并通过用户控制的探索机制从低参与度聚类中采样。

Result: 实验显示，系统显著降低列表内相似性（0.34到0.26），提升意外性（0.73），72.7%的长期用户偏好探索性推荐。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持用户满意度的同时，有效促进多样性和内容发现。

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with over-specialization, which severely
limits users' exposure to diverse content and creates filter bubbles that
reduce serendipitous discovery. To address this fundamental limitation, this
paper introduces an adaptive clustering framework with user-controlled
exploration that effectively balances personalization and diversity in movie
recommendations. Our approach leverages sentence-transformer embeddings to
group items into semantically coherent clusters through an online algorithm
with dynamic thresholding, thereby creating a structured representation of the
content space. Building upon this clustering foundation, we propose a novel
exploration mechanism that empowers users to control recommendation diversity
by strategically sampling from less-engaged clusters, thus expanding their
content horizons while preserving relevance. Experiments on the MovieLens
dataset demonstrate the system's effectiveness, showing that exploration
significantly reduces intra-list similarity from 0.34 to 0.26 while
simultaneously increasing unexpectedness to 0.73. Furthermore, our Large
Language Model-based A/B testing methodology, conducted with 300 simulated
users, reveals that 72.7% of long-term users prefer exploratory recommendations
over purely exploitative ones, providing strong evidence for the system's
ability to promote meaningful content discovery without sacrificing user
satisfaction.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文件结构的ANN索引实现eCP-FS，解决了多索引竞争内存资源的问题，并评估了其性能开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分析流程中，多个ANN索引竞争有限的GPU/CPU内存资源，导致需要磁盘索引结构。现有索引实现复杂且不易可视化或分析。

Method: 将索引数据结构映射为文件结构，使用文件库实现，使其易于读取和可视化。以eCP-FS为例，评估其性能开销。

Result: eCP-FS在性能上稍逊于内存索引，但在内存受限场景下具有优势，适合多索引环境。

Conclusion: eCP-FS提供了一种低内存占用的替代方案，适用于资源受限或多索引场景。

Abstract: Modern analytical pipelines routinely deploy multiple deep learning and
retrieval models that rely on approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) indexes to
support efficient similarity-based search. While many state-of-the-art
ANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes
creates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn
necessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical
index implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is
serialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based
indexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize
the index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is
either embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads
the data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that
maps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the
index easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The
disadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of
searching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe
this performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a
file-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A
comparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the
implementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not
constrained. In a memory-constrained scenario, eCP-FS offers a minimal memory
footprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained or multi-index
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TFC-SR的新方法，通过结合主动回忆机制改进持续学习，显著提升了模型在Split MNIST和Split CIFAR-100上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，借鉴人类学习策略（如主动回忆、刻意练习和间隔重复）。

Method: 引入任务聚焦巩固与间隔回忆（TFC-SR），结合主动回忆探针机制，定期评估模型记忆以稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100上，TFC-SR的最终准确率为13.17%，显著优于标准重放的7.40%。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，强调了在持续学习系统中整合主动记忆检索机制的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Method: 使用Hermitian矩阵表示数据特征，将数据点映射到Hilbert空间，提取量子几何特性（如维度、量子度量和Berry曲率）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了QCML的全局数据捕捉能力。

Conclusion: QCML的量子几何表示有望推动量子认知领域的发展。

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as
quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our
understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖核函数捕捉数据非线性，但需专家确保非线性最大化数据多样性和变异性。

Method: 提出3种独立性准则，设计无监督和监督降维方法，并在线性和神经网络非线性设置下评估。

Result: 方法在对比度、准确性和可解释性上优于基线（如tSNE、PCA、VAE等）。

Conclusion: 为可解释机器学习研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够有效处理不平衡数据和高维时空数据，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为野火预测提供了一种高效且可行的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂的气候数据环境。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables

prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates
natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal

demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和鲁棒性上表现优越，适用于通用无监督异常检测和医学影像应用。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

TL;DR: MaPPO是一种新的偏好优化框架，通过引入先验奖励知识改进现有方法（如DPO），提升大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为最大似然估计问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致对齐效果不佳。

Method: MaPPO将先验奖励估计整合到最大后验目标中，扩展了现有方法，支持离线和在线优化，且无需额外超参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如MT-Bench）中，MaPPO显著提升了模型对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化方法，可无缝集成到现有框架中，显著提升对齐效果。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoSLD是一个自动化框架，利用进化算法和大型语言模型（LLMs）共同发现神经网络的缩放定律，显著减少人工实验需求，并在多个实际场景中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统发现神经网络缩放定律需要大量人工实验和专业知识，EvoSLD旨在通过自动化框架减少这一需求。

Method: EvoSLD结合进化算法和LLMs，共同优化符号表达式及其优化流程，处理缩放变量、控制变量和响应指标。

Result: 在五个实际场景中，EvoSLD重新发现了两个人类推导的定律，并在其他情况下超越它们，测试集误差显著降低。

Conclusion: EvoSLD在准确性、可解释性和效率上优于基线方法，有望加速AI研究。

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种几何感知评估框架LAPD，用于检测临床LLMs在输入微小变化时的潜在鲁棒性问题，并引入LDFR指标量化诊断不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策支持的LLMs在输入微小变化时表现不稳定，而标准NLP指标无法检测这种潜在表示变化。

Method: 提出LAPD框架，通过结构化对抗编辑（如掩码、否定、同义词替换和数值变化）生成扰动临床笔记，并利用PCA降维空间中的LDFR指标评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验发现，即使输入表面变化极小，临床LLMs的潜在表示也会不稳定，且在真实临床数据（DiReCT基准）中验证了LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 几何感知评估揭示了临床AI表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距，强调了在安全关键领域进行此类审计的重要性。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如卷积、循环或注意力网络）在图学习任务中缺乏透明性和效率，因此需要一种更可解释且资源高效的替代方案。

Method: 利用GLWT分解图节点信号，通过非线性调制和小波系数重组，结合符号逻辑和领域特定语言（DSL）进行推理，适用于去噪和标记分类等任务。

Result: 在合成图去噪和语言标记图任务中，性能与轻量级图神经网络（GNN）相当，但透明性和效率显著更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提供了一种原则性、可解释且资源高效的替代方案，优于传统深度神经网络。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures
for learning on graphs.

Motivation: 异质图中局部特征聚合限制了非局部节点间的长距离依赖捕捉，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 参数化邻接矩阵以学习非局部节点间的连接，扩展浅层GCN的跳数范围。

Result: 方法在节点分类任务上表现不一致，且无法泛化到所有异质图。

Conclusion: 提出的方法虽能改善长距离依赖捕捉，但受限于图结构，泛化能力不足。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework
that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario
training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks.
EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of
digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in

TL;DR: AdaptHetero是一个基于机器学习解释（MLI）的框架，旨在通过解释性洞察指导针对不同子群体的模型训练和评估，提升EHR数据的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据的复杂性和异质性限制了机器学习解释在指导子群体特定建模中的效果，因此需要一种新方法来转化解释性洞察为可操作的指导。

Method: AdaptHetero结合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，识别临床有意义的子群体特征，优化模型训练和评估。

Result: 在三个大规模EHR数据集上的实验表明，AdaptHetero能有效识别ICU死亡率、院内死亡和隐性低氧血症预测中的异质性模型行为，提升预测性能。

Conclusion: AdaptHetero通过将解释性洞察转化为子群体特定的建模指导，显著提升了EHR数据的预测效果。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示联邦学习（FL）中语言模型的隐私威胁，此前因文本数据的离散性而被低估。

Method: 提出Grab，结合交替优化过程（包括层间dropout掩码优化和离散序列优化）。

Result: Grab在基准和实际设置中分别实现最高92.9%和48.5%的恢复率提升。

Conclusion: Grab为理解FL中语言模型的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖多个LLM处理不同任务，效率低且资源消耗大，需要一种更灵活高效的单一LLM解决方案。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优越，并在实际无线测试平台上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: ContextLoRA和ContextGear为多模态交互应用提供了一种高效、灵活的单一LLM解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

Motivation: 现实世界数据分布不均衡且长尾，传统算法在非均衡数据集上表现不佳，需开发能处理不完美数据的鲁棒算法。

Method: 分为四部分：1) 从长尾数据学习生成模型；2) 通过归纳正则化提升尾部类别泛化能力；3) 半监督学习优化指标；4) 高效领域适应。

Conclusion: 开发的算法能有效处理现实世界中的不完美数据，减少对人工标注的依赖，扩展深度学习应用范围。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，能够自主预测沸腾动力学，无需依赖模拟数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理时需要未来输入，无法从过去状态学习成核现象，且未能建模流动沸腾速度场。

Method: Bubbleformer采用因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放和热物理参数条件化，适用于多种流体、几何和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流动方面取得了新的基准结果。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过创新的模型设计和高质量数据集BubbleML 2.0，显著提升了沸腾动力学的建模能力。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在整合多源噪声实验数据时需要精确噪声水平和手动调参的问题。

Method: 提出Adam-PnP框架，结合自适应噪声估计和动态模态加权机制，指导预训练的蛋白质扩散模型。

Result: 在复杂重构任务中显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为多源数据驱动的蛋白质结构生成提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

Motivation: PCE在高维问题中因基函数数量指数增长而难以扩展，需要一种能够有效处理高维输入空间的方法。

Method: 通过将PCE与概率电路结合，提出DeepPCE，一种深度推广的PCE模型。

Result: DeepPCE在高维输入空间中表现出与多层感知器（MLP）相当的预测性能，同时保留了PCE的精确统计推断能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE成功解决了PCE在高维问题中的扩展性挑战，同时保持了其统计推断优势。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

Motivation: 推荐系统通常过于关注点击相关性，而忽略了多样性和新颖性。现有强化学习方法依赖随机探索，可能不符合用户兴趣。

Method: LAAC利用LLM作为参考策略提出新颖项目，并通过轻量级策略优化这些建议。采用双层优化框架，演员和评论家网络协同工作，评论家选择有潜力的新颖动作，演员改进策略。通过正则化减少对不可靠LLM建议的高估。

Result: 实验表明，LAAC在多样性、新颖性和准确性上优于现有基线，且在数据不平衡时表现稳健。

Conclusion: LAAC成功整合LLM知识，无需昂贵微调，显著提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合数据和全阶模型（FOM）的混合降阶模型（ROM），用于预测时空混沌动力学，并通过自动编码器和贝叶斯方法优化预测能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用已知物理模型（FOM）和数据驱动技术相结合，提升混沌动力学系统的预测能力。

Method: 使用自动编码器找到不变流形坐标，将FOM的向量场投影到流形上，并通过动态数据或贝叶斯方法进行修正。采用神经常微分方程方法。

Result: 在Kuramoto-Sivashinsky和复杂Ginzburg-Landau方程的模拟数据中，混合方法在数据丰富、稀缺甚至FOM参数错误的情况下均显著优于纯数据方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法能够有效结合物理模型和数据，显著提升混沌动力学系统的预测能力。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经辐射场（NeRF）和物理信息神经网络（PINN）的神经符号框架，用于从稀疏多视角图像序列重建和模拟弹性物体，无需显式几何信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纯经验方法可能偏离物理原理，以及传统数值求解器需要完整几何知识且计算成本高的问题。

Method: 结合NeRF进行物体重建，利用PINN融入弹性力学偏微分方程，通过能量约束的PINN架构处理复杂边界和初始条件。

Result: 方法能够从图像监督和物理约束中学习时空变形表示，提高模拟准确性和结果可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为弹性物体的重建和模拟提供了一种高效且物理一致的方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

*Yaoyu Zhang,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDNet是一种基于对比扩散的网络，通过生成正负样本来增强时间序列分类器的性能，尤其在噪声、相似和多模态数据条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在时间序列分类中表现优异，但在类相似性、多模态分布和噪声等挑战性数据条件下性能下降。

Method: CDNet通过学习扩散过程生成正负样本，利用卷积近似反向扩散步骤，并结合不确定性加权复合损失进行鲁棒训练。

Result: 在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上的实验表明，CDNet显著提升了现有深度学习分类器的性能。

Conclusion: CDNet在噪声、相似和多模态数据条件下优于现有方法，为时间序列分类提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

*Xuan Wu,Di Wang,Chunguo Wu,Kaifang Qi,Chunyan Miao,Yubin Xiao,Jian Zhang,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ECHO的高效神经组合优化（NCO）求解器，用于解决多车辆异构容量车辆路径问题（MMHCVRP），通过双模态节点编码器和参数无关交叉注意力机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCO求解器多针对单车辆VRP，忽略了更现实的多车辆MMHCVRP，且现有方法在解码时易做出短视决策，忽视局部拓扑关系、车辆排列不变性和节点对称性等关键特性。

Method: ECHO采用双模态节点编码器捕捉节点局部拓扑关系，使用参数无关交叉注意力机制减少短视决策，并引入数据增强策略以稳定强化学习训练。

Result: 实验表明，ECHO在不同车辆和节点数量下均优于现有NCO求解器，并表现出良好的泛化能力。消融研究验证了各方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过创新方法有效解决了MMHCVRP中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

*Shiva Raja,Cansu Demirkiran,Aakash Sarkar,Milos Popovic,Ajay Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EpochCore的专用硬件加速器，用于加速状态空间模型（SSMs），通过LIMA-PE微架构和ProDF数据流，显著提升了性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时存在内存限制和计算效率低的问题，而SSMs虽然能处理长序列，但训练和推理计算密集。

Method: 设计了基于脉动阵列的EpochCore加速器，引入LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，以高效支持SSMs。

Result: EpochCore在性能和能效上分别提升了250倍和45倍，同时延迟/推理速度比GPU提升了约2000倍。

Conclusion: EpochCore为SSMs提供了高效的硬件支持，显著提升了长序列任务的性能。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标加权切比雪夫演员-评论家算法（MOCHA），用于多目标强化学习（MORL），以系统探索Pareto-稳态解，并具有有限时间样本复杂度保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多目标强化学习中，系统探索非凸奖励目标下的Pareto-稳态解是一个重要但未充分研究的问题。

Method: 结合加权切比雪夫（WC）和演员-评论家框架，提出MOCHA算法，通过选择学习率实现样本复杂度为O(ε⁻²)。

Result: 在KuaiRand离线数据集上的模拟研究表明，MOCHA算法显著优于其他基线MORL方法。

Conclusion: MOCHA算法填补了MORL领域的重要空白，为Pareto-稳态解探索提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

*Amber Huang,Ian Scott Knight,Slava Naprienko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIT-PCBA基准数据集存在严重的数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，导致模型评估不公平，甚至可以通过简单记忆方法超越先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LIT-PCBA数据集在虚拟筛选基准测试中的缺陷，以提醒社区关注数据质量对模型评估的影响。

Method: 通过审计数据集，识别数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，并设计一个基于记忆的基线方法验证问题的影响。

Result: 发现大量数据泄漏和重复（如2491个非活性分子在训练和验证集中重复），导致模型无法公平评估。基线方法通过利用这些问题超越了先进模型。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA数据集因数据完整性问题不再适合作为基准，呼吁社区开发更可靠的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扭矩的分层重连策略，通过动态调整消息传递来改进异质图表示学习并增强对噪声图的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在原生图结构上的信息传递可能不够高效，尤其是在异质图和噪声图中，因此需要开发图重连方法。

Method: 定义了一种干扰感知的扭矩度量，结合结构距离和能量分数，量化边的扰动，并据此分层修剪高扭矩边和添加低扭矩边。

Result: 在基准数据集上，该方法在异质图和同质图上均优于现有方法，并在噪声图上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 扭矩驱动的分层重连策略有效提升了图神经网络的表示学习和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

*Kaiwen Chen,Xin Tan,Minchen Yu,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemShare是一种新型的KV缓存管理方法，通过识别和重用相似的中间推理步骤，显著减少内存开销并提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在数学推理和形式逻辑任务中表现优异，但其生成的冗长推理链导致推理过程中内存开销巨大。观察到中间推理步骤高度相似，对应相似的KV缓存状态，因此提出MemShare以优化内存管理。

Method: MemShare采用协同过滤算法高效识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用，从而减少内存开销。

Result: 实验表明，MemShare在保持准确性的同时，吞吐量最高提升84.79%，优于现有KV缓存管理方法。

Conclusion: MemShare通过重用相似KV缓存状态，有效降低内存开销并提升性能，为大型推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

TL;DR: 提出两种新框架PVD-Net和PVD-ONet，解决物理信息神经网络在奇异扰动问题中的收敛问题，无需数据仅依赖控制方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络和DeepONet在奇异扰动问题中常无法收敛，需新方法解决。

Method: PVD-Net采用两网络架构结合Prandtl匹配条件（稳定性优先）或五网络架构结合Van Dyke匹配原则（高精度优先）；PVD-ONet扩展为算子学习，直接映射初始条件到解算子。

Result: 数值实验显示新方法在多种误差指标下优于基线。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为多尺度问题提供了强大新工具。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

TL;DR: RAGDP是一种无需额外训练的新框架，通过知识库加速预训练扩散策略（DPs）的推理，提高速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略（DPs）生成动作慢，现有知识蒸馏方法（如CP）训练时间长，RAGDP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RAGDP通过编码观察-动作对构建专家演示的向量数据库，推理时提取最相似动作并结合中间去噪步骤减少扩散步骤。

Result: RAGDP在20倍加速下仍保持准确性优势，比CP等蒸馏模型准确率提高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP在无需额外训练的情况下，显著改善了扩散策略的速度与准确性权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分散式学习中测试数据有限和个性化分布适应的问题。

Method: 每个客户端维护本地和外部内存，通过服务器协调检索相似客户端的原型，利用嵌入相似性和不确定性进行本地适应。

Result: 在领域适应和损坏基准测试中表现优异，通信和计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte在分散式环境中有效提升模型性能，同时保持对分布外数据的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)
evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior,
capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用简单的神经网络输出（分类概率分布）进行下一事件预测的有效性，并研究了为何这种方法在时间点过程模型中不常见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究简单输出结构在时间点过程模型中未被广泛使用的原因，并探索现有数据集的局限性。

Method: 通过扩展和创建新数据集，比较简单分类分布输出的性能。

Result: 发现简单分类分布在多种数据集上表现优异，且现有模型表现好可能源于正则化效应。

Conclusion: 简单分类分布输出在时间点过程模型中具有竞争力，尤其在信息有限的数据集之外表现突出。

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Motivation: 当前基因组序列建模方法难以将机器学习模型的归纳偏置与生物系统的进化结构对齐，因此需要一种更有效的表示方法。

Method: 采用双曲CNN，利用生物系统的进化结构，生成更具表达力的DNA序列表示，避免了显式系统发育映射的需求。

Result: 在42个基因组解释基准数据集中，37个上双曲模型优于欧几里得模型，并在7个GUE基准数据集上超越现有技术，同时参数更少且无需预训练。

Conclusion: 双曲框架为基因组表示学习提供了稳健的范式，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP)的方法，用于解决异构欺诈检测图中文本提示信息过载的问题，通过细粒度目标节点信息和粗粒度邻居信息结合，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本提示方法在处理异构欺诈检测图时，由于多跳关系导致信息爆炸，影响模型性能。

Method: DGP方法通过细粒度保留目标节点文本信息，同时粗粒度总结邻居信息，结合文本和数值特征的定制化摘要策略。

Result: 实验表明，DGP在可控的token预算内，将欺诈检测性能提升至多6.8%（AUPRC）。

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLM在欺诈检测中的潜力，有效解决了信息过载问题。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Conclusion: 通过不确定性传播框架，本文的分析为机器学习的不确定性量化提供了理论基础，揭示了自洽模型与概率分布的内在联系。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Motivation: 商品需求预测面临市场波动和非线性依赖的挑战，需要经济一致的预测。

Method: PREIG整合GRU和PINN，通过定制损失函数嵌入价格与需求的负弹性约束，并采用混合优化策略。

Result: 在多个商品数据集上，PREIG在RMSE和MAPE上显著优于传统模型和深度学习基线。

Conclusion: PREIG通过结合领域知识、优化理论和深度学习，提供了稳健、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Result: 实验验证了ZS-PAG在多种基准测试中的有效性和优越性，且方法具有理论保证。

Conclusion: ZS-PAG填补了零样本机器遗忘的空白，显著提升了模型性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

Result: 在PaRoutes多步基准测试中，TempRe表现出色，优于模板分类和SMILES生成方法。

Conclusion: 模板生成建模是计算机辅助合成规划中的强大范式。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

Conclusion: RF-CRATE不仅性能优越，还提供了数学可解释性，为安全敏感应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化结合新型随机模型为CCS项目提供了一种更有效的优化方法，有望推动能源行业的可持续发展。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

Conclusion: 研究量化了非线性如何帮助FNOs捕获非平凡特征，为超参数选择提供标准，并解释了尺度不变激活和残差连接对特征学习的增强作用。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

Method: 先找到近似通解，再通过样条变换线性估计ODE系数。

Result: 高精度发现稀疏ODE模型，对噪声数据鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于真实实验环境，推动数据驱动技术学习物理现象。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

Motivation: CoT推理虽然增强了语言模型的问题解决能力，但因其依赖长序列的自回归解码而带来高计算开销。现有加速方法存在速度提升有限或未充分利用小模型优势的问题。

Method: 提出R-Stitch框架，基于置信度在小模型和大模型之间动态切换解码，避免全序列回滚，仅在不确定步骤调用大模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，R-Stitch实现了高达85%的推理延迟减少，且准确性几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: R-Stitch是一种无需训练、模型无关的加速方法，显著提升了CoT推理的效率。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,
and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations
for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance
comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and
an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824).
Data challenges, including outliers and skewed distributions, indicate a need
for improved preprocessing to enhance predictive reliability.

TL;DR: DynamicMPNN是一种逆向折叠模型，通过联合学习多构象集合，显著提升了多状态蛋白质设计的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构生物学假设一个序列对应一个结构和功能，但许多生物过程依赖多构象蛋白质。现有方法依赖单状态预测的聚合，实验成功率低。

Method: 引入DynamicMPNN，通过联合学习多构象集合，生成兼容多构象的序列。训练数据包括46,033对构象，覆盖75%的CATH超家族。

Result: DynamicMPNN在挑战性多状态蛋白质基准测试中，比ProteinMPNN在结构归一化RMSD上提升高达13%。

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN为多构象蛋白质设计提供了更高效的方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one
structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from
enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple
conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc
aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success
rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse
folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple
conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained
on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein
benchmark.

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA
violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we
propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了强化学习（RL）在大型语言模型（LLMs）后训练中的应用，通过Meta的广告生成工具AdLlama展示了RLPF方法的有效性，显著提升了广告点击率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL是LLMs后训练的主要技术，但其经济影响尚未充分研究和量化。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种名为RLPF的后训练方法，利用历史广告表现数据作为奖励信号，并在Meta的广告生成工具中部署了RL训练的LLM AdLlama。

Result: 在10周的大规模A/B测试中，AdLlama将点击率提高了6.7%，广告主满意度也显著提升。

Conclusion: RLPF是一种有前景且可推广的后训练方法，能够弥合语言模型与实际效果之间的差距。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏在对抗样本生成中的潜力，以提高黑盒攻击的效率和效果。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet-161作为教师模型，通过课程切换和联合优化策略训练学生模型，生成对抗样本并评估。

Result: 学生模型的攻击成功率与集成基线相当，生成时间减少六倍；低温和硬标签监督显著提升迁移性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅是模型压缩技术，还能提升黑盒对抗攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Motivation: 旨在通过DRL解决库存管理中的实际问题，避免对需求分布或参数的不切实际假设。

Method: 采用基于DirectBackprop的DRL算法，应用于多种库存管理场景，并提出Structure-Informed Policy Network技术以提升策略性能。

Result: DRL方法在多种场景中表现优于或与现有基准和启发式方法相当，且无需大量参数调整。

Conclusion: DRL在库存管理中成功结合了数据驱动学习和分析洞察，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Motivation: 解决连续时间深度学习模型中时间依赖权重的表达性和稳定性问题，特别是在计算资源受限的情况下。

Method: 使用多项式基函数（如单项式和Legendre多项式）参数化权重的时变特性，并在神经ODE和ResNet中评估其性能。

Result: Legendre多项式基在训练稳定性、计算效率和准确性方面优于单项式基和无约束权重模型。

Conclusion: 正交多项式基（如Legendre）在模型表达能力和训练效率之间提供了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Motivation: 供应链中需求预测的复杂性、领域转移和外部因素变化使得准确预测困难，现有基础模型存在架构僵化和分布变化下的鲁棒性不足问题。

Method: 采用分层集成（HE）和架构集成（AE）策略，分别捕捉局部模式和整合多样化模型预测。

Result: 在M5基准和三个外部销售数据集上表现优于基线，提升了跨层次预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架简单有效，能显著提升复杂预测环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

Motivation: 解决多标签数据流中的分布演化、高维标签空间、稀疏标签和复杂标签依赖问题。

Method: 使用增量层次聚类和全局树学习器，结合漂移检测动态调整标签分区。

Result: 在23个数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在多标签分类任务中表现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

fundamental role of the configuration matrix, which combines information about
the types of cardinal semantic operators in the CAO, their parameters and

Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU
acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to
facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational
Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of

shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary

range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities
through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a
novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss
terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples
include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target
trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to
emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation
through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability,
and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD

Conclusion: GNN-DCMs为复杂空间选择场景中离散选择建模与深度学习的结合提供了一个统一且表达力强的框架。

Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis
as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive
performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly
capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a
long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap,
this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to
analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models
(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture
dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to
classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the
GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated
logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic
interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.
Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural
networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77
community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture
individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.
Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and
expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning
in the complex spatial choice contexts.

Result: 理论验证了LPLR结构在实际深度学习场景中的鲁棒性，从全连接网络到ResNet架构均适用。

Conclusion: 通过NTK框架将局部景观几何与快速优化联系起来，为梯度优化在深度学习中的高效性提供了理论解释。

Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of
deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While
recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a
sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to
explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In
this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption
on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally
Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds
the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks
admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear
convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that
matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse
settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern
ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR
structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously
connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK
framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the
remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.

Motivation: 现代贝叶斯机器学习中的MCMC算法（如SGLD）牺牲了渐近精确性以换取计算速度，导致传统样本质量诊断方法失效。

Method: 基于Sklar定理，设计了一种计算高效的CD诊断方法，独立于边缘分布评估依赖结构的准确性。

Result: CD在超参数选择中显著优于传统方法，并能检测尾部依赖的细微差异。

Conclusion: CD为近似推断时代提供了结构感知的样本质量评估工具，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern
Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a
critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail
catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based
diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct
assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in
multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled
and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to
isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure
independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first
structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate
inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically
outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter
selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where
traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect
subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank
correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical
Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With
computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein
discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC
practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of
structure-aware sample quality assessment.

Method: 引入一种可扩展的局部采样性能评估基准，测试多种常见SGMCMC算法，重点关注RMSProp预处理的SGLD。

Result: RMSProp预处理的SGLD在局部后验采样中表现最佳，尽管缺乏全局收敛理论保证，但能在O(100M)参数的模型中提取局部信息。

Conclusion: 研究强调从全局到局部采样的转变，为未来在退化景观中的SGMCMC算法研究提供了实用工具和方向。

Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks,
but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms
interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence
guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely
incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this
gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as
a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local
sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common
algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at
faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution.
Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our
empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local
information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究森林转型（森林、农业和废弃土地之间的动态变化）的复杂性及其对森林砍伐的影响。

Method: 开发了一个随机微分方程模型，并提出了新的深度学习方法来估计模型参数。

Result: 模型能够捕捉森林转型的动态变化，并通过参数估计预测未来的森林砍伐趋势。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解森林转型和预测森林砍伐提供了新的方法和工具。

Abstract: Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest,
agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed
a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of
these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions
for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model
parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter
estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model
parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest
and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to
understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从有限样本中提取关于连续概率分布的信息。

Method: 基于顺序统计量的非参数方法，分析样本点对实数线的分割。

Result: 每段概率质量期望为1/(N+1)，离散熵为log2(N+1)比特。

Conclusion: 该框架为非参数推断（如密度和尾部估计）提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous
probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from
it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real
line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly
$1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental
properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying
distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete
entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the
sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare
this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its
implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and
tail estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MIBoost的新算法，用于在缺失数据情况下统一变量选择机制，扩展了梯度提升框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多重插补数据集上进行模型选择时的挑战，避免简单策略的次优性能。

Method: 扩展梯度提升框架，提出MIBoost算法，通过统一损失函数实现跨插补数据集的变量选择。

Result: 模拟研究表明，MIBoost的预测性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: MIBoost为缺失数据下的变量选择提供了一种有效且易于实现的解决方案。

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO,
elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for
building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often
complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address
missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets.
However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the
presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling
models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although
more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and
therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the
regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss
function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our
key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise
gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a
uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation
studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to
that of these recently proposed methods.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在强化学习游戏中的嵌入空间结构，以理解其如何表示视觉输入和环境复杂性。

Method: 通过调整Robinson等人的体积增长变换方法，分析视觉硬币收集游戏中token嵌入空间的结构，并证明分层空间可实现一般体积增长曲线。

Result: 发现嵌入空间不是流形而是分层空间，局部维度随点变化；RL代理的潜在表示在低维和高维间交替变化。

Conclusion: 分层潜在空间的维度分布可作为强化学习游戏复杂性的新几何指标。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a
transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)
game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an
agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of
"spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth
transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space
for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better
modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to
point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general
volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry
out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent
representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while
following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the
agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the
environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently,
our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent
space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.

Result: 在多种失配条件下，模型能准确预测参数和微观结构演化，且具有时间外推能力。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，可扩展到其他系统，并可能通过实验视频推断未知参数。

Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently
tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of
an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of
elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further
microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by
focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,
and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution
supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable
convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be
performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of
misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and
the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical
conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational
domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five
times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The
proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific,
prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental
videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating
further temporal evolution.

Motivation: 合成序列控制聚合物结合了合成聚合物的化学多样性和生物蛋白质的精确序列功能，但设计困难，缺乏类似蛋白质设计的大规模数据集。

Method: 采用深度神经网络，通过低保真数据训练，快速调整以在不同条件下进行高保真预测。

Result: 该方法显著减少数据需求，加速聚合物设计，并有望扩展到其他相关系统。

Conclusion: 这种“预训练-微调”方法为合成聚合物设计提供了高效途径，并可能推动原子级设计的AI应用。

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science
by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise
sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of
these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the
massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of
proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to
dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials'
design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a
\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension
between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules,
which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling,
depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the
polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset
to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network
trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one
set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a
distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be
needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity
parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire
constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an
approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from
fast, coarse simulations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的高效图像重建方法RI-GAN，用于射电望远镜数据重建，并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型射电干涉望远镜（如SKA）的发展，现有重建方法（如CLEAN算法）计算量大且缺乏不确定性量化，需要更高效、高质量的重建技术。

Method: RI-GAN框架结合了条件生成对抗网络（rcGAN）和梯度U-Net（GU-Net）架构，利用Wasserstein GAN提升训练稳定性，并通过正则化项避免模式崩溃。输入为脏图像和点扩散函数（PSF），输出高质量重建图像。

Result: RI-GAN能高效生成高质量重建图像，适应不同可见度覆盖范围，支持更高动态范围，并提供不确定性量化。

Conclusion: RI-GAN为下一代射电望远镜提供了计算高效、可扩展且具有不确定性感知的成像方法。

Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 研究发现人类视觉和语言相似性判断基于共享的、模态无关的表征结构，与视觉系统编码经验的方式一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉和语言之间共享表征格式的可能性，以及这种表征在人类行为中的表现。

Method: 63名参与者对100张自然场景图像和100个对应句子进行行为相似性判断，并与fMRI脑响应进行比较。

Result: 视觉和语言相似性判断在行为层面收敛，并预测相似的fMRI响应；基于LLM嵌入的模型优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 人类视觉和语言共享一种模态无关的表征结构，反映了外部世界的稳定关系属性。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared
representational format between vision and language remains a significant
challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both
vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from
large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems
converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,
embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a
space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three
participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100
natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural
Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not
only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar
network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.
Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings
outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the
behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual
and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared,
modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system
encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems
suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as
arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured
representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external
world.

TL;DR: 本文综述了过滤近似最近邻搜索（FANNS）方法，提出了新的数据集，并评估了多种方法的性能，发现没有一种方法在所有场景下都最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FANNS领域缺乏多样化和真实的数据集，特别是基于最新Transformer模型的文本嵌入数据。

Method: 引入了一个包含270万篇arXiv论文摘要嵌入向量及11种属性的新数据集，并评估了多种FANNS方法。

Result: 不同方法各有优劣，没有一种方法在所有场景下表现最佳。例如，ACORN支持多种过滤类型但性能不如专用方法，SeRF在有序属性上表现优异但不支持分类属性。

Conclusion: 没有通用的最佳FANNS方法，需根据具体场景选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress
across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation,
recommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition.
Many applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve
items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a
filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered
Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are
benchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the
current FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,
particularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding
models. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding
vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv
repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and
categories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and
find that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single
approach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports
various filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often
outperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for
range filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.
Filtered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the
large-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based
embeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier
embeddings. We conclude that no universally best method exists.

Motivation: 随着数据管道的复杂性增加，手动编写和维护数据合约变得容易出错且耗时。

Method: 采用参数高效的微调方法（如LoRA和PEFT）适配LLMs，输入样本数据或模式描述，输出JSON Schema等格式的合约定义。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的LLMs在生成有效合约方面准确率高，减少70%以上的手动工作量。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可通过弥合意图与实现之间的差距，实现可扩展、敏捷的数据治理。

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow
in complexity, manual authoring and maintenance of contracts becomes
error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

Motivation: 真实布料材料因复杂工艺（如缝合、染色等）表现出高度复杂性，传统有限元方法计算成本高且易出现膜锁定问题。

Method: 将布料离散化为质量-弹簧网络，通过新型力-冲量损失函数直接从运动数据中学习材料参数。

Result: 该方法能准确建模空间变化的材料特性，训练速度更快、重建精度更高，且能泛化到新动态场景。

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net框架在布料模拟中表现出高效性和准确性，优于传统方法和现有神经网络架构。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

Germline mutation specialization via fine-tuning on ClinVar and HGMD, improving
accuracy for both SNVs and non-SNVs; (3) Interpretable clinical framework
integrating DNA sequence embeddings with LLM-based statistical explanations to
provide actionable insights. Validated against ClinVar, EnTao-GPM demonstrates
superior accuracy in mutation classification. It revolutionizes genetic testing
by enabling faster, more accurate, and accessible interpretation for clinical
diagnostics (e.g., variant assessment, risk identification, personalized
treatment) and research, advancing personalized medicine.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the outcome of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)
is essential for guiding prenatal counseling and minimizing delivery-related
risks. This study presents supervised machine learning models for predicting
vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using 643,029 TOLAC cases from the CDC
WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023). After filtering for singleton births with
one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period
features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a
multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an
AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the
logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class
weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in
XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and
precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted
maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as
key predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that routinely collected,
early-pregnancy variables can support scalable and moderately high-performing
VBAC prediction models. These models offer potential utility in clinical
decision support, particularly in settings lacking access to specialized
intrapartum data.

Conclusion: 提出了三种数据利用模式，为临床预测模型的外部数据使用提供了指导。

Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when
deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a
large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous
multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and
introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large
dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The
anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance,
particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust
to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity.
Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of
large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of
available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain
generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a
domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and
(iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for

*Gershy Ben-Arie,Daniel Engelsman,Rotem Dror,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散去噪的陀螺罗盘方法，结合深度学习模型，显著提高了低成本陀螺仪的导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏外部导航辅助的场景下，低成本陀螺仪的导航精度和实时性面临挑战，尤其是在自主车辆等应用中。

Method: 结合扩散去噪框架和增强的学习型航向估计模型，先对原始惯性传感器信号进行去噪处理，再输入深度学习模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基于模型的陀螺罗盘精度提高26%，比其他学习驱动方法提高15%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本陀螺仪在自主平台中的导航系统提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用软体机器人的非线性动力学实现多行为控制的物理储备计算（PRC）方法，并发现了未训练吸引子的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在扩展物理储备计算框架，探索软体机器人（如张拉整体机器人）的多行为控制及其动力学特性。

Method: 通过模拟研究，利用张拉整体机器人的非线性体-环境动力学，实现多行为的嵌入与控制，并分析系统的吸引子特性。

Result: 系统表现为多稳态动力学系统，存在未训练吸引子，反映了机器人及其环境交互的固有特性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解具身认知的未充分探索特征提供了新视角，展示了PRC在具身AI研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

*Chang-Hun Ji,SiWoon Song,Youn-Hee Han,SungTae Moon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策变换器的无人机轨迹规划器，通过单一参数RTG动态调整安全与效率的权衡，无需专家知识，并在仿真和实际环境中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式规划器需要专家调整参数且效果有限，而强化学习规划器未明确解决安全与效率的权衡问题。

Method: 采用决策变换器框架，利用RTG参数作为温度参数动态调整安全与效率的权衡。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该规划器能通过RTG参数动态调整，生成更安全或更高效的轨迹，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的规划器简单有效，适用于未知环境，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

Result: 在模拟控制和真实导航实验中，样本效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在可解释性、复杂性和安全性方面具有优势，适用于少量甚至单次观察示范的场景。

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Result: 展示了算法在仿真和真实环境中的性能，验证了套件的实用性。

Conclusion: MoDeSuite有望推动移动操作变形物体领域的研究。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究纵向数据中异常值检测的问题，比较传统统计方法与现代方法的优劣。

Method: 应用传统统计方法和基于距离或二叉树的现代方法到面板调查数据中。

Result: 传统方法简单但需要特定假设，现代方法更灵活且适用于多维数据，但需设置调参。

Conclusion: 现代方法在异常值检测中更具优势，尤其是处理多维数据时。

Abstract: This note investigates the problem of detecting outliers in longitudinal
data. It compares well-known methods used in official statistics with proposals
from the fields of data mining and machine learning that are based on the
distance between observations or binary partitioning trees. This is achieved by
applying the methods to panel survey data related to different types of
statistical units. Traditional methods are quite simple, enabling the direct
identification of potential outliers, but they require specific assumptions. In
contrast, recent methods provide only a score whose magnitude is directly
related to the likelihood of an outlier being present. All the methods require
the user to set a number of tuning parameters. However, the most recent methods
are more flexible and sometimes more effective than traditional methods. In
addition, these methods can be applied to multidimensional data.

Conclusion: OneShield为LLMs提供了一种灵活且可定制的保护方案，能够满足不同客户的具体需求。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many
possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and
all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature
of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential
risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In
this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and
customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities
for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and
compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific
customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability
considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first
deployment.

Motivation: AI在医疗诊断中的快速应用引发了对患者隐私的担忧，尤其是在敏感图像数据传输、存储和处理过程中。

Method: 提出了一种改进的卷积神经网络（Masked-CNN），结合AES-CBC加密和JPEG2000压缩技术，对加密后的医学图像进行诊断推理。

Result: 在公共DICOM数据集上的实验表明，加密推理模型的性能与未加密模型相当，仅在准确性和延迟上有轻微折衷。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据隐私与临床实用性之间取得了平衡，为安全的AI驱动诊断提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

Conclusion: 该方法为3D点云分类模型的安全性评估提供了更实用的黑盒攻击工具。

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御方法因忽视模型对后门触发器的过度依赖而效果有限，特别是恶意客户端比例增加时。

Method: 提出扰动触发器生成机制、生成良性对抗扰动以破坏模型对后门触发器的依赖，并设计自适应缩放机制动态调整扰动强度。

Result: 实验表明，FedBAP在三种后门攻击下分别降低攻击成功率0.22%-5.34%、0.48%-6.34%和97.22%-97.6%。

Conclusion: FedBAP能有效抵御后门攻击，尤其在新攻击中表现突出。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates
outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future
RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable
anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental
results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high
detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and
interpretable outputs.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain
trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent
trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain
protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique
of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

Motivation: 评估机器学习模型对训练数据的隐私泄露风险，尤其是在低误报率下的表现。

Method: CMIA通过条件影子训练利用实例间的成员依赖关系；PMIA通过代理选择策略利用相似样本的行为进行推理。

Result: 实验表明CMIA和PMIA在两种设置下均显著优于现有方法，尤其在低误报率下表现突出。

Conclusion: CMIA和PMIA为评估模型隐私风险提供了更有效的工具，尤其在低误报率场景下。

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

Motivation: 企业环境中隐私合规信息分散且难以提取，需要一种统一的方法来连接和分析这些多样化资源。

Method: PACT利用DRAGON嵌入模型和对比学习目标，通过微调连接不同资源的文本组件（如元数据、所有权信息等）。

Result: PACT显著提升了多项性能指标，如召回率从18%提升至53%，查询匹配率从9.6%提升至69.7%。

Conclusion: PACT通过嵌入驱动的图结构有效解决了企业隐私合规分析的复杂性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection
of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical
information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is
often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender

Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

*Zixuan Chen,Weikai Lu,Xin Lin,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自降级防御（SDD）的框架，通过让LLM对有害指令生成高质量但不相关的响应，从而在恶意微调时降低模型能力，有效防御攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLM）的安全对齐方法容易被恶意微调绕过，需研究防御策略。

Method: 理论分析恶意微调成功的原因，提出SDD框架，使LLM对有害指令生成不相关但高质量的回答。

Result: 实验证明SDD能有效抵御恶意微调攻击，显著降低模型在有害指令上的能力。

Conclusion: SDD是一种有效的防御策略，能保护LLM免受恶意微调的攻击。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaXsive是一种无需训练的扩散模型水印技术，具有高容量和鲁棒性，解决了现有方法对RST攻击的脆弱性和ID冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业扩散模型的成功引发版权保护和不当内容生成问题，现有水印技术对RST攻击脆弱且容量低。

Method: 利用初始噪声嵌入水印，并注入X形模板以恢复RST失真，避免使用重复环状图案。

Result: 在验证和识别场景下，MaXsive在两大水印基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MaXsive显著提升了水印的鲁棒性和容量，减少了ID冲突的可能性。

Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the
release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright
protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion
watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior
works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.
Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易受到对抗样本的攻击，但缺乏评估其鲁棒性的研究。

Method: 通过监测特定神经元输出的变化来定义NCCR指标，用于衡量模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，NCCR能有效评估神经网络及其输入的鲁棒性，并检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: NCCR是一种有效的评估工具，可用于提高神经网络的安全性。

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的隐写分析方法，首次将GraphSAGE架构应用于压缩VoIP语音流的隐写分析，实现了高检测精度和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的隐写分析方法存在计算复杂和泛化能力不足的问题，需要一种更高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: 通过从VoIP流构建简单图，并利用GraphSAGE捕获分层隐写分析信息，包括细粒度细节和高层模式。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在检测QIM隐写模式时表现出色，短样本（0.5秒）检测精度超过98%，低嵌入率条件下达95.17%，检测时间仅0.016秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在短样本和低嵌入率条件下实现了高精度和高效检测，为在线隐写分析提供了优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

TL;DR: GUARD-CAN是一种结合图表示学习和时间序列建模的异常检测框架，用于保护车载网络免受CAN攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车载网络因CAN缺乏加密和认证而面临多种网络威胁，需要一种有效的安全解决方案。

Method: GUARD-CAN将CAN消息分窗并转为图，利用AE和GCN生成图嵌入向量，再通过GRU检测时间异常。

Result: GUARD-CAN能有效检测四种CAN攻击（泛洪、模糊、重放和欺骗攻击），无需复杂特征工程。

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN通过多视角评估和窗口大小分析，证明了其在车载网络安全中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

*Muzhi Dai,Shixuan Liu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecTOW是一种通过迭代防御-攻击训练增强多模态大语言模型安全性的方法，解决了现有防御模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性面临挑战，尤其是针对设计用于绕过安全约束的不安全图像-查询对。现有方法无法充分解决内在漏洞或导致过度拒绝无害输入。

Method: 提出SecTOW，包含防御者和辅助攻击者两个模块，通过强化学习（GRPO）迭代训练。攻击者识别漏洞并扩展数据，防御者利用扩展数据提升安全性。设计了奖励机制和质量监控机制。

Result: 实验表明，SecTOW显著提升了安全性，同时保持了通用性能。

Conclusion: SecTOW为MLLMs的安全性问题提供了有效的解决方案，平衡了安全性与性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型计算成本高，GANs提供高效替代方案，同时捕捉热涨落。

Method: 基于Kinetic Monte Carlo模拟构建数据集，训练条件GAN生成系统状态序列。

Result: 网络定量重现平衡和动力学性质，偏差仅几个百分点。

Conclusion: GANs在随机动力学建模中潜力大，但需注意外推限制。

Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully
exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while
capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a
two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations
and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a
dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained
to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the
generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications
with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase
accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively
reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with
deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and
future perspectives are critically discussed.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项Logit模型（MNL）规范和估计中的潜力，通过实验评估了六种主流LLM的表现，发现专有模型（如Claude和GPT）表现优于开源模型（如Llama和Gemma），并提供了实际应用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在尚未充分探索的选择建模领域的潜力，特别是在模型规范和估计中的辅助作用。

Method: 采用系统实验框架，评估13个版本的6种LLM在五种实验配置下的表现，包括建模目标、提示策略和信息可用性。

Result: 专有LLMs能生成有效且行为合理的模型规范，尤其是结构化提示下；开源模型表现较差；GPT-3能自我估计模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在选择建模中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，研究为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows
across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains
relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive
agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of
Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework
involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.
These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting
vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.
Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data
dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,
and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and
model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and
behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by
structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to
produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the
best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with
robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided
with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance
internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of
correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.
Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of
LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification
but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide
practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'
workflows.

Motivation: URI重定向对网站管理至关重要，但其复杂性影响可用性、SEO性能和数字保存，需深入研究其模式和影响。

Method: 分析1100万个唯一重定向URI，跟踪每个URI最多10跳，揭示重定向模式和结果。

Result: 50%的URI成功终止，50%出错；常见规范重定向（如HTTP到HTTPS），非规范重定向反映网站迁移或安全风险；发现“sink”URI和62000个自定义404页面。

Conclusion: URI重定向在塑造网络中起关键作用，但也面临过时URI、服务器不稳定等问题。研究为网站管理员、研究人员和数字档案管理员提供了改进建议。

Abstract: URI redirections are integral to web management, supporting structural
changes, SEO optimization, and security. However, their complexities affect
usability, SEO performance, and digital preservation. This study analyzed 11
million unique redirecting URIs, following redirections up to 10 hops per URI,
to uncover patterns and implications of redirection practices. Our findings
revealed that 50% of the URIs terminated successfully, while 50% resulted in
errors, including 0.06% exceeding 10 hops. Canonical redirects, such as HTTP to
HTTPS transitions, were prevalent, reflecting adherence to SEO best practices.
Non-canonical redirects, often involving domain or path changes, highlighted
significant web migrations, rebranding, and security risks. Notable patterns
included "sink" URIs, where multiple redirects converged, ranging from traffic
consolidation by global websites to deliberate "Rickrolling." The study also
identified 62,000 custom 404 URIs, almost half being soft 404s, which could
compromise SEO and user experience. These findings underscore the critical role
of URI redirects in shaping the web while exposing challenges such as outdated
URIs, server instability, and improper error handling. This research offers a
detailed analysis of URI redirection practices, providing insights into their
prevalence, types, and outcomes. By examining a large dataset, we highlight
inefficiencies in redirection chains and examine patterns such as the use of
"sink" URIs and custom error pages. This information can help webmasters,
researchers, and digital archivists improve web usability, optimize resource

Result: 理论分析表明，温度参数的不同取值会导致最优策略的随机性或确定性，并通过数值实验验证了结果的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文明确了互信息最优控制中温度参数与策略随机性的关系，为相关研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an
extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce
regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to
theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e.,
the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the
policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains
unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate
this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of
discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of
the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and
then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which
the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also
derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the
policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and
deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

Result: 实验结果表明，DLRS能够加速训练并提高稳定性。

Conclusion: 动态学习率调度器（DLRS）是一种有效的自适应方法，适用于复杂神经网络训练。

Abstract: Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of
the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them
can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is
made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is
usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex
systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This
adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and
optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a
dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the
learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.
Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and
convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the
proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their
application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow

logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation
strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning
skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical

ChemDFM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable,

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by
analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising
method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems.
The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative
example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex
spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and
topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating
such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple
scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust
numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in
the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of
regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based
on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles
offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response
to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical
predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a
characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual
pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of
image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or
biological system in the real world.

isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing
interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings
learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker
detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers
of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR
and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker
environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios.
In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a
computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our
knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE
system.

### [260] [Conversations over Clicks: Impact of Chatbots on Information Search in Interdisciplinary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21490)
*Hannah Kim,Sergei L. Kosakovsky Pond,Stephen MacNeil*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式AI（GenAI）对学习者体验的影响，重点关注学习者如何利用其提供的信息。研究发现GenAI在制定学习计划后有助于导航，但在此之前可能适得其反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨学科领域（如生物信息学）中，学习者需要独立导航复杂信息空间，而GenAI可能改变其信息搜索行为。

Method: 采用自民族志方法，研究GenAI聊天机器人如何影响学习者的导航行为和信息识别。

Result: GenAI在学习计划确立后支持导航，但在此之前无效；传统信息源（如项目符号）在GenAI响应中效果较差。

Conclusion: GenAI在跨学科学习环境中需谨慎使用，因其效果取决于学习者的领域知识。

Abstract: This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on
the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize
the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to
navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further
compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied
prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences
information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a
GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do
learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an
autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to
support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was
counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information
sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when
applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized
through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These
findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with
caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.

*Anushka Debnath,Stephen Cranefield,Emiliano Lorini,Bastin Tony Roy Savarimuthu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理和诱导信任关系中的能力，特别是在电子交互环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任是社会关系的核心，电子交互中AI系统可能帮助用户理解社交状态，LLMs在此领域的潜力值得探索。

Method: 通过实验评估LLMs在信任推理和角色扮演中的表现，分析其是否能规划行动以建立信任。

Result: LLMs展现出在信任推理和诱导信任方面的潜力，但具体效果需进一步验证。

Conclusion: LLMs在信任关系管理中具有应用前景，但需更多研究优化其能力。

Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that
helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a
strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together
effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through
electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems
to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In
this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason
about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering
trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust
by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions
which can instil trust.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出并评估了两种情绪监控仪表板，旨在提高用户情绪意识并减少仇恨言论。研究发现这些干预措施有效，但也可能增加负面情绪表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管社交媒体平台采取了主动审核技术，但仍被批评为审查和未能解决不文明行为的根本原因。研究旨在通过情绪监控工具改善数字互动。

Method: 研究涉及211名参与者，评估两种情绪监控仪表板对用户评论行为和情绪体验的影响。

Result: 干预措施提高了用户情绪意识并减少了仇恨言论，但也可能增加敏感话题讨论中的负面情绪表达。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来将情绪调节工具整合到社交媒体平台以促进健康数字互动提供了基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VizGenie是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自改进框架，通过动态生成模块和自然语言接口提升科学可视化能力，减少认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学可视化中复杂任务的自动化需求，降低用户的技术门槛，同时通过动态学习和验证提升系统的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 结合预定义工具和LLM生成的脚本，通过自动化验证和视觉模型（VQA）实现自然语言交互和可视化探索。

Result: 在复杂体积数据集上显著降低了迭代可视化任务的认知负担，提升了洞察生成效率和可重复性。

Conclusion: VizGenie通过整合领域工具和LLM灵活性，实现了可持续进化的科学可视化实践，支持特征中心探索和可重复研究。

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FingerTip基准，旨在解决移动GUI代理在主动意图预测和个性化任务执行中的不足，通过环境观察和用户偏好提升交互效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动GUI代理仅能执行显式指令，缺乏主动意图预测能力，且未利用用户上下文信息，导致个性化不足。

Method: 提出FingerTip基准，包含两个新任务：基于环境观察和用户历史意图的主动任务建议，以及考虑用户偏好的个性化任务执行。收集了真实用户的多步Android交互数据。

Result: 实验表明，所提任务具有挑战性，但基于收集数据微调的模型能有效利用用户信息并取得良好效果。

Conclusion: FingerTip基准展示了构建更用户导向的移动GUI代理的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device
interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'
previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action
preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android
device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are
not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in
their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information.
Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned
with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved
good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more
user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了教育者如何通过设计定制GPT工具支持定性研究方法教学，发现AI能增强学生反思能力，但也存在认知过载等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育中AI工具设计以学生为中心、定性方法教学中AI应用不足的问题。

Method: 基于TPACK框架和行动研究方法，设计定制GPT工具支持课程任务。

Result: 工具提升了学生反思能力和分析思维，但也引发认知过载等担忧。

Conclusion: 教育者主导的AI设计能促进反思性、协作性学习，为高等教育AI应用提供新思路。

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出神经包容性AI概念，批评现有AI对自闭症人群的偏见，提出新基准AUTALIC以改善数据代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统基于神经典型社交能力标准，边缘化自闭症人群，需推动更包容的AI发展。

Method: 分析反自闭症偏见的起源与影响，通过实验验证二元标注方案的有效性，开发AUTALIC基准。

Result: 90%类人AI代理排斥自闭症视角，AUTALIC能有效标注反自闭症仇恨言论。

Conclusion: 神经包容性AI是未来方向，AUTALIC为模型评估与微调提供基础。

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

Motivation: 研究解释行为中的情感作用，认为解释是一种社会互动，情感在其中扮演重要角色。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，模拟解释者如何考虑听众的情感反应，并通过实验验证模型。

Result: 模型能较好地预测人类直觉，优于不考虑情感的基准模型，表明人们在解释时确实会考虑情感因素。

Conclusion: 情感在解释行为中具有重要作用，计算框架为理解这一现象提供了新视角。

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

Motivation: 传统方法（如博客、静态课程）难以支持深度理解和批判性思维，需探索更有效的AI素养教育方法。

Method: 通过605名参与者的对照研究，评估交互式AI教程对公平性、数据集代表性和语言模型偏见等概念的学习效果。

Result: 交互式模拟显著提升AI素养，增强知识迁移和自信心，但参与度与学习效果无直接关联。

Conclusion: 交互式、探究驱动的方法能更好地帮助个人在日常生活中批判性地与AI互动。

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can
better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.

Motivation: 现有可穿戴AI系统依赖用户主动触发或预定义任务知识，忽视了用户的当前心理状态。

Method: 基于认知理论，系统将感知信息建模为记忆项和片段，并通过编码机制（如置换和干扰）实时预测最佳辅助时机。

Result: 在12名参与者的实验中，ProMemAssist比LLM基线系统提供了更精准的辅助，并获得了更高的用户参与度。

Conclusion: 工作记忆建模能提供更细致、上下文敏感的辅助，为设计更智能的主动代理提供了方向。

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

Result: AI素养（尤其是自我效能感、概念理解和应用技能）显著预测工具的可用性、满意度和参与度，进而影响学习效果；而先前的AI接触无显著影响。

Conclusion: AI素养而非接触经验塑造学生体验，设计者应整合适应性指导和用户中心功能以支持不同素养水平，创建包容、激励和有效的AI学习环境。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

Motivation: LLM代理在移动设备GUI任务中表现有限，因缺乏对真实应用场景的了解，导致任务规划低效甚至幻觉。

Method: 提出基于轨迹的记忆机制和粗到细的任务规划方法，结合双LLM架构执行任务。

Result: 实验证明MapAgent优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MapAgent通过记忆增强和上下文感知规划，显著提升任务执行效果，代码将开源。

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

Conclusion: Sync-TVA有效解决了跨模态交互和模态贡献不平衡问题，提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally
intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However,
existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced
contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA,
an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic
enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a
dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous
cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual
features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for
robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and
weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.

(iii) openended tasks requiring complex problem solving. Our current dataset
contains diverse set of examples, including a machine learning challenge to
classify high-energy physics events, such as the four top quark signal. To
ensure continued relevance, we propose a living benchmark, where physicists

TL;DR: DeepGo是一种预测性定向灰盒模糊测试工具，结合历史和预测信息，通过最优路径引导模糊测试到达目标位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定向模糊测试（DGF）技术依赖启发式算法优化适应度指标，缺乏对未执行路径的预见性，导致难以处理复杂约束路径，效率低下。

Method: 提出路径转换模型，将DGF建模为通过特定路径转换序列到达目标的过程；利用深度神经网络构建虚拟集成环境（VEE）预测未执行路径的奖励；开发强化学习模型（RLF）生成最优路径转换序列。

Result: DeepGo能够高效引导模糊测试通过最优路径到达目标位置。

Conclusion: DeepGo通过结合历史和预测信息，显著提升了定向模糊测试的效率和目标达成能力。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD框架通过多智能体系统自动生成软件架构设计，优于现有基线，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件架构设计依赖人工，耗时且设计选择有限，MAAD旨在通过多智能体系统自动化这一过程。

Method: MAAD采用四个专业智能体（分析师、建模师、设计师和评估师）协作生成架构蓝图和评估报告。

Result: MAAD在案例研究和对比实验中表现优于MetaGPT，生成更全面的架构组件和结构化评估报告。

Conclusion: MAAD展示了多智能体系统在架构设计中的潜力，LLM选择（如GPT-4o）对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

*Jing Wang,Shang Liu,Yao Lu,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HLSDebugger是一种针对HLS逻辑调试的定制化解决方案，通过生成大规模标注数据集和采用编码器-解码器结构，显著提升了调试效率，性能远超GPT-4等先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HLS代码调试对缺乏硬件知识的用户具有挑战性，LLMs虽有潜力但面临数据稀缺、逻辑复杂和多任务需求等难题。

Method: HLSDebugger生成300K标注数据集，采用编码器-解码器结构，同时进行错误定位、类型预测和修正。

Result: HLSDebugger在错误识别和修正上显著优于GPT-4，修正效率提升3倍以上。

Conclusion: HLSDebugger为HLS代码自动化调试提供了重要进展。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在代码生成中的广泛应用，维护学术诚信和招聘公平性需要开发可靠的AI生成代码检测系统。

Method: 从CodeNet数据集生成AI代码样本，覆盖三种使用场景，构建包含121,271个AI生成和32,148个人工编写代码的数据集。

Result: 评估了三种检测模型在跨模型和跨语言场景下的性能，并公开数据集以支持研究。

Conclusion: MultiAIGCD为AI生成代码检测提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI生成代码（vibe coding）对软件开发的影响，提出这是一种人类与生成式AI通过自然语言对话协作的新范式，并分析了其机会与风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成代码的普及，快速采用与有限概念理解之间的脱节促使对这一新兴范式的研究。

Method: 通过意图视角和历史分析，定义vibe coding为人类与AI通过自然语言对话协作的软件开发范式。

Result: 研究发现vibe coding重新分配了认知工作，将软件开发中的专业知识从传统领域转向协作编排，并识别了机会与风险。

Conclusion: 论文提出了未来研究议程，涵盖人类、技术和组织三个方向，以指导对这一范式的进一步探索。

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

*Zengyang Li,Yimeng Li,Binbin Huang,Peng Liang,Ran Mo,Hui Liu,Yutao Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练代码语言模型（CodeLMs）在检测跨语言错误（CLBs）中的潜力，开发了工具CLCFinder并构建了一个CLB数据集。实验表明，微调后的CodeLMs性能显著提升，其中UniXcoder-base表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言编程日益普遍，但跨语言错误（CLBs）难以检测，传统单语言工具无法应对。

Method: 开发CLCFinder工具，构建包含三种编程语言组合的CLB数据集，微调13种CodeLMs并评估其性能。

Result: 微调后CodeLMs性能显著提升，UniXcoder-base表现最佳（F1分数0.7407）。小模型优于大模型，单语言错误数据集微调的模型表现不佳。

Conclusion: CodeLMs在CLB检测中潜力显著，但需针对CLB特性进行微调，数据集规模和代码注释的影响因模型而异。

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

TL;DR: 论文实现了一种基于量子计算的神经网络，用于分类MNIST图像，展示了量子不确定性对性能的提升，并分析了物理噪声对分类的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子神经网络在经典计算机视觉任务中的应用，并研究量子效应（如不确定性）对网络性能的影响。

Method: 在离子阱和IBM超导量子计算机上实现量子神经网络，通过模拟训练并在量子硬件上进行推理，引入插值参数控制量子效应。

Result: 适度的量子不确定性提高了网络性能，物理噪声对模糊图像的分类影响显著，而对清晰图像影响较小。

Conclusion: 量子神经网络在特定任务中表现出优势，未来扩展可能实现经典不可模拟的量子优势。

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

Conclusion: 信息几何优化在量子机器学习中具有潜力，特别是在标准方法难以应对的场景下。

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum
Boltzmann machines. The em algorithm is an information-geometric extension of
the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured
alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability
and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted
Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This
structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum
expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the
proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based
training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of
information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly
in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or
vanishing gradients.

TL;DR: 提出量子Koopman方法（QKM），通过将非线性动力学转化为高维可观测空间中的线性酉演化，实现量子加速模拟非线性现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算在非线性动力学中的应用受限于酉演化的要求，QKM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用Koopman算子理论实现全局线性化，通过深度自编码器将系统状态映射到希尔伯特空间，分解为模和相位，由酉Koopman算子控制演化。

Result: 在多种非线性系统中验证，预测误差低于6%，并捕捉到2D湍流的关键统计特性。

Conclusion: QKM为量子加速模拟非线性现象提供了实用框架，结合深度学习和量子算法的优势。

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

Motivation: 大数据和人工智能时代对数据存储和处理效率的需求推动了量子图像处理（QIP）的发展，以利用量子计算解决复杂问题。

Method: 通过模拟比较四种QImRs（TNR、FRQI、NEQR、QPIE）的压缩性能，并评估量子内核在分类问题中的表现。

Result: FRQI在图像信息压缩上表现最佳；量子内核在分类任务中与经典线性内核精度相当，但资源消耗显著更低。

Conclusion: 量子图像表示和内核在压缩和分类任务中具有潜力，尤其是在资源效率方面优于经典方法。

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一个高效的奖励模型，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多个方面。通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本的交互，并支持多种偏好数据微调。实验表明其在自动评估和推理扩展方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且难以训练。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，引入Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本的交互，支持多种偏好数据微调。

Result: LLaVA-Reward在文本-图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估维度上优于传统和MLLM方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward提供了一种高效、多视角的自动评估方法，显著提升了文本到图像生成的评估质量。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练峰值精度，速度提升2倍，令牌使用仅35%。

Conclusion: ReGATE显著提升训练效率，并在多模态基准测试中超越基线，同时减少令牌总数41%。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception

Conclusion: 为牙科影像中基于GAN的方法提供了未来研究的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频语言模型（VLMs）在动作检测任务中因少量示例导致的过拟合问题，以及场景级预训练与人物中心理解之间的粒度不匹配问题。

Method: 结合参数高效调优（LoRA）和可学习内部特征增强（通过FiLM实现），并引入基于预测差异的动态加权损失函数。

Result: 在AVA和MOMA等多标签、多人动作检测数据集上取得了较高的mAP性能，展示了显著的数据效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了VLMs在动作检测任务中的适应问题，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

TL;DR: MapDiffusion提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，用于学习向量化地图的完整分布，解决了传统确定性方法无法捕捉不确定性和环境模糊性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的地图构建模型只能提供确定性的点估计，无法处理现实环境中的模糊性（如遮挡和缺失的车道标记）。

Method: MapDiffusion利用扩散模型，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件化。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion在在线地图构建中实现了最先进的性能，单样本性能提升5%，且多样本聚合进一步提高了ROC曲线上的表现。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整的地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但语言模糊性限制了细粒度编辑。

Method: 提出多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；构建ChartM3基准和训练集ChartM3-Train。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对构建实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，但现有检测器在真实场景中的有效性尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试方法，使用先进生成技术创建包含50万张高质量深度伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 测试的检测器中，不到一半的AUC分数超过60%，最低为50%，图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍具挑战性，需进一步改进检测器以应对真实场景。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有标准性能指标通常依赖于生成描述与人工描述的比较，难以深入理解模型的整合机制。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能提供可解释的解释，并比较不同模型在可解释性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解多模态模型的整合机制提供了新视角，并提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

Motivation: 保护计算机视觉模型的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 新方法为模型保护提供了可证明的保障，且不影响正常使用。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife

public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time

conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法通过创新技术有效提取数据集关键信息，显著提升了蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Motivation: 固定分辨率的潜在扩散模型在高分辨率图像生成中存在局限性，而基于补丁的方法虽有效但存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，优化补丁分布和去噪路径。

Result: APT生成更清晰的高分辨率图像细节，并加快采样速度，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Result: 在包含16,140张眼底图像的EDID数据集上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类中表现出色，是目前公开数据集上性能最高的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Motivation: 解决后训练量化在有限校准数据下性能下降的问题，尤其是隐私约束下数据生成方法的不足。

Method: 使用mixup-class prompt策略，融合多个类别标签生成合成数据，并结合梯度范数和泛化误差分析。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法，并在极低位量化（W2A4）中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了PTQ的泛化性和稳定性，尤其在低位量化场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖难以获取的阴影掩码，而基于局部对比信息的替代方法在复杂场景中因模糊性受限。

Method: 提出AGBA机制动态过滤和重加权对比先验，结合FCFN利用高频和对比线索恢复细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优，且与基于掩码的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN有效解决了阴影去除中的模糊性和细节恢复问题。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

TL;DR: CEDANet结合公民科学和弱监督域适应，显著提升工业烟雾分割性能，无需目标域标注即可接近全监督模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业烟雾分割中像素级标注成本高且稀缺的问题，利用公民提供的弱标签提升模型性能。

Method: 提出CEDANet框架，结合公民投票优化伪标签，并采用类感知对抗特征对齐方法。

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数和IoU分别提升5倍和6倍，接近全监督模型效果。

Conclusion: 验证了公民科学与弱监督域适应结合的可扩展性和成本效益，为数据稀缺的环境监测提供实用方案。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分割的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法，用于点云分类的神经网络，通过点位移机制生成易于人类理解的显著性图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI的快速发展，理解其在关键领域决策过程的需求日益增长，尤其是点云数据分类算法的可解释性。

Method: 利用点云分割模型和新型点位移机制引入扰动，生成有意义的显著性图。

Result: 相比传统聚类方法，该方法生成的显著性图更易于人类理解。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成可解释性强的显著性图方面优于现有方法，适用于点云分类任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

TL;DR: AI在医疗中的应用可能不会改善医患关系，反而可能进一步削弱治疗关系和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在医疗中的潜在影响，尤其是对医患关系的负面影响。

Method: 通过分析Eric Topol的观点和现实因素，提出AI可能带来的问题。

Result: AI可能无法实现改善医患关系的预期目标，反而可能加剧问题。

Conclusion: 医疗AI的发展需谨慎，以避免对医患关系产生负面影响。

Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the
development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic
shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he
suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks
of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate
advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking
its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention
to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately,
several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health
care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient
relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic
relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOOC的完成率低，部分原因是缺乏个性化内容。通过预测学习者表现，可以提供更有针对性的支持。

Method: 采用多元时间序列分类方法，比较不同方法在不同课程阶段（如5周、10周后）识别高风险学习者的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些方法在预测MOOC学习者失败方面具有潜力，且预测准确性受记录的行为数据丰富度影响。

Conclusion: 行为数据的多样性和丰富性对预测学习者表现至关重要，未来可进一步优化预测模型。

Abstract: MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates
remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue,
it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored
feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time
series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time
series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages
of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted
on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three
courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the
evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The
analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of
recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse
behavioral data.

Result: 框架能通过迭代讨论识别代理的困惑或误解，并设计针对性补充材料，显著提高代理的新闻理解能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升不同受众的新闻理解能力，直接解决其理解差距，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: In the interconnected world, news media are critical in conveying information
to public across diverse domains including technology, finance, and
agriculture. Journalists make efforts to present accurate information, however,
the interpretation of news often varies significantly among different audiences
due to their specific expertise and age. In this work, we investigate how to
identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences
understanding of news content, particular to the aspects of articles outside
their primary domains of knowledge. We propose a agent-based framework using
large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where
several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts
from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that
this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the
agent through the iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate
identification, the framework can design a supplement material specific to
these agents on the news. Our results show that agents exhibit significantly
improved news understanding after receiving this material. These findings
highlight our framework's utility and efficiency in enhancing news
comprehension for diverse audiences by directly addressing their understanding
gap.

Motivation: 当前对话代理的价值对齐方法多为自上而下，脱离实际场景，导致与用户利益不一致。

Method: 基于ISO价值工程标准，分析16,908条对话日志中的593个伦理敏感输出，识别核心价值和错位。

Result: 发现9个核心价值和32种价值错位，这些错位对用户产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究为对话代理提供商提供了实际可行的建议，以实现更符合场景的伦理对齐。

Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) based on generative artificial intelligence
frequently face challenges ensuring ethical interactions that align with human
values. Current value alignment efforts largely rely on top-down approaches,
such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods
tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate,
potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing
the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT
design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from
16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to
identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world
interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value
misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable
insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve
more context-sensitive value alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph
theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and
threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The
framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and
discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware
keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct
temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the
model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on
TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal
alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node
latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural
interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and

Abstract: AGI Racing is the view that it is in the self-interest of major actors in AI
development, especially powerful nations, to accelerate their frontier AI
development to build highly capable AI, especially artificial general
intelligence (AGI), before competitors have a chance. We argue against AGI
Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by
this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from
AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI
safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be
lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable
whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third,
international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted
deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have
much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to
AGI is supposed to provide. Hence, racing to AGI is not in anyone's
self-interest as other actions, particularly incentivizing and seeking
international cooperation around AI issues, are preferable.

Result: 数据集包含3,142个CT扫描和8,028个标注发现，79%为局灶性异常。

Conclusion: ReXGroundingCT为胸部CT中的自由文本分割模型设立了新基准。

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at

Conclusion: 该研究为振荡器系统中高容量模拟联想记忆的实验实现提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they
incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's
pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with
combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling,
inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its
dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory
model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory
retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the
quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states
corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between
memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region
and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows
exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the
theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve
superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the
limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator
network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern
retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the
Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward
experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in
oscillator systems.

Conclusion: MAVF为生成式AI在验证自动化中的应用开辟了新方向，有望解决芯片设计中最具挑战性的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is
attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these
technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation,
their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip
development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an
innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the
limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our
framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications
to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents,
including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code
implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of
varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms
traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in
verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench
generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI
applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective
approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻摘要方法仅依赖文本内容和相似日期的文章，缺乏对利益相关者的分析，导致效果不佳。

Method: 利用大型语言模型构建SET三元组，并引入基于利益相关者的排名方法，构建了一个通用的相关性度量。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于所有现有基线，成为新的最先进技术。

Conclusion: 利益相关者信息在新闻文章中的重要性得到了验证，SUnSET框架具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within
news article.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何配置5G中的cell DTX/DRX以平衡节能与数据包延迟，通过深度强化学习训练AI代理实现最优配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中cell DTX/DRX是一种重要的节能技术，但会增加数据包延迟。研究旨在优化配置，以在延迟敏感流量中最大化节能同时最小化服务质量（QoS）下降。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，设计了一种基于深度Q网络（DQN）和上下文赌博机（CB）模型的学习算法，以及平滑逼近理论最优但不连续奖励函数的奖励机制。

Result: 仿真结果显示，与不使用cell DTX/DRX相比，AI代理在不同流量负载下可实现高达45%的节能，同时QoS下降不超过1%。

Conclusion: 通过DRL框架训练的AI代理能够动态选择最优的cell DTX/DRX配置，有效平衡节能与QoS，适用于不同网络和流量条件。

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“combolutional layer”的新型音频前端，用于提取时域谐波特征，适用于需要精确谐波分析的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在音频处理中，选择合适的归纳偏置对机器学习模型至关重要，尤其是短音频片段可能包含数百万样本时。

Method: 提出了一种结合学习延迟IIR梳状滤波器和融合包络检测器的combolutional层，用于时域谐波特征提取。

Result: 在三个信息检索任务中验证了其有效性，计算成本低，CPU推理高效，且具有严格实数计算和更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: combolutional层是卷积层的有效替代，适用于钢琴转录、说话人分类和音调检测等任务。

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker
classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has
several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter
count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语音数据集中存在不良特征（如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐），可能影响模型学习，因此需要一种高效的多任务解决方案。

Method: Whilter结合Whisper编码器和基于注意力的分类器，同时解决五个分类问题，并发布了一个标注数据集。

Result: Whilter在五个子任务中的三个上F1分数超过85%，错误率6.5%-7.8%，优于BEATs分类器，且处理时间更短。

Conclusion: Whilter是一种高效的多任务模型，能有效识别语音数据集中的不良样本，性能优于单任务替代方案。

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to
a combination of single-task alternatives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型循环神经网络架构ENN，结合了显式记忆矩阵和Hebbian可塑性，提升了模型的解释性和长程依赖建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前循环神经网络依赖隐式记忆，限制了其解释性和长程依赖建模能力。受生物神经系统中显式记忆痕迹的启发，作者设计了ENN。

Method: ENN通过动态Hebbian痕迹显式建模记忆形成与回忆，并采用稀疏注意力驱动检索机制。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和WikiText-103任务上，ENN表现与传统RNN、GRU和LSTM相当，同时显著提升了解释性。

Conclusion: ENN验证了神经科学机制在开发更可解释深度学习模型中的潜力，展示了生物启发的显式记忆建模的优势。

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

Conclusion: 微分神经元是积分神经元的潜在替代方案，为高能耗AI应用提供可持续选择。

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

TL;DR: DeepFDM是一个可微分的有限差分框架，用于学习时间依赖偏微分方程（PDEs）中的空间变化系数，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在学习和识别参数化PDEs中的系数时效率低、参数多且缺乏解释性的问题。

Method: 通过将前向欧拉离散化嵌入卷积架构，利用CFL兼容的系数参数化确保稳定性和一阶收敛性。

Result: 在多种PDEs测试中，DeepFDM的误差比现有方法低1-2个数量级，训练周期和参数需求显著减少，且恢复的系数与真实参数匹配度高。

Conclusion: DeepFDM为数据驱动的参数化PDE求解和识别提供了高效、鲁棒且透明的基准方法。

Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning
spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a
convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order
convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights
correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable
inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar
PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and
inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger
distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared
errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators,
U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer
parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match
ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust,
efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification
of parametric PDEs.
