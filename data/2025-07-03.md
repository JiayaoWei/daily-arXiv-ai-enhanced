### [1] [MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01019)
*Imran Mirza,Cole Huang,Ishwara Vasista,Rohan Patil,Asli Akalin,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALIBU是一个评估多智能体系统中LLM隐含偏见的新基准，通过场景化评估揭示偏见问题，并提出需平衡公平策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM的隐含偏见，需开发工具评估和解决这一问题。

Method: MALIBU通过两阶段评估（评分和比较）量化LLM输出中的偏见。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体，需更细致的公平策略。

Conclusion: 需透明评估标准和平衡的公平策略以减少多智能体系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

### [2] [Event-based evaluation of abstractive news summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01160)
*Huiling You,Samia Touileb,Erik Velldal,Lilja Øvrelid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件重叠的方法来评估生成式摘要的质量，通过比较生成摘要、参考摘要和原文中的事件信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖人工参考摘要的相似性评分，未能充分捕捉事件信息的完整性。

Method: 计算生成摘要、参考摘要和原文之间的事件重叠，使用挪威语数据集进行实验。

Result: 方法能更深入地分析摘要中的事件信息。

Conclusion: 基于事件的评估方法为摘要质量提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

### [3] [Matching and Linking Entries in Historical Swedish Encyclopedias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01170)
*Simon Börjesson,Erik Ersmark,Pierre Nugues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了瑞典百科全书《Nordisk familjebok》第一版和第二版中地理条目的变化，发现从欧洲转向北美、非洲、亚洲、澳大利亚和北欧的显著地理趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是揭示19世纪末至20世纪初瑞典知识界的地理关注变化，反映历史事件（如第一次世界大战）对百科全书内容的影响。

Method: 使用数字化文本，通过语义句子嵌入匹配条目，基于Transformer的分类器提取地理条目，并链接到Wikidata进行分析。

Result: 发现从第一版（1876-1899）到第二版（1904-1926），地理焦点从欧洲显著转向其他地区，如北美和亚洲。

Conclusion: 研究证实了历史事件对百科全书内容的影响，并展示了数字化方法在文化研究中的潜力。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The
code and data are available on GitHub at

### [4] [MEGA: xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion for Precise Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01213)
*Adamu Lawan,Juhua Pu,Haruna Yunusa,Jawad Muhammad,Muhammad Lawan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于xLSTM和MEGA的新框架，用于改进Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)任务，解决了现有方法在计算效率和性能平衡上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法在计算效率和性能之间存在矛盾，如深度学习模型缺乏全局上下文，Transformer计算资源需求高，Mamba方法依赖CUDA且局部相关性不足。xLSTM在长距离依赖建模上的潜力尚未在ABSA中应用。

Method: 提出xLSTM与Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA)框架，结合双向mLSTM和部分翻转反向流(PF-mLSTM)，通过MECGAF机制动态融合前向和反向输出，优化局部和全局依赖捕捉。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGA在ABSA任务中优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架成功解决了ABSA任务中的性能与效率平衡问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

### [5] [The Medium Is Not the Message: Deconfounding Text Embeddings via Linear Concept Erasure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01234)
*Yu Fan,Yang Tian,Shauli Ravfogel,Mrinmaya Sachan,Elliott Ash,Alexander Hoyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种去偏算法，通过从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息，显著减少了文本嵌入中的偏差，提升了相似性和聚类指标，且不影响分布外性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关混杂因素（如文本来源或语言）的影响，这在需要合并不同语料库的应用中尤为成问题。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息。

Result: 在所有评估的嵌入变体和任务中，文档相似性和聚类指标均显著提升，且分布外性能未受影响。

Conclusion: 去偏算法能有效减少嵌入中的偏差，且不会对嵌入的其他性能造成负面影响。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

### [6] [GAIus: Combining Genai with Legal Clauses Retrieval for Knowledge-based Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01259)
*Michał Matak,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型在处理非英语和非中文国家的法律问题时提供答案和引用的能力，提出了一种基于波兰民法典的认知代理架构gAIus，其检索机制优于嵌入方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大型语言模型在处理非主流语言法律问题时的引用和准确性不足的问题。

Method: 方法包括分析法律信息检索历史、案例法与成文法的差异，并提出基于波兰民法典的gAIus架构，采用更可解释的检索机制。

Result: 实验结果显著提升了模型性能，gpt-3.5-turbo-0125提升了419%，gpt-4o-mini从31%提升到86%。

Conclusion: 结论展示了未来研究方向和潜在应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base
their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of
non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.
At the end of our paper we show the possible future path of research and
potential applications of our findings.

### [7] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Multimodal Simulated Ophthalmic Decision-Making in Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01278)
*Cindy Lie Tabuse,David Restepo,Carolina Gracitelli,Fernando Korn Malerbi,Caio Regatieri,Luis Filipe Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4在眼科中模拟临床决策的能力被评估，结果显示其在糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）筛查中表现中等，但在青光眼筛查中表现较差。添加临床元数据对结果无显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在眼科中的应用潜力，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变和青光眼的筛查中。

Method: 使用300张标注的眼底图像，通过结构化提示描述图像，评估GPT-4在ICDR严重程度评分、DR转诊建议和青光眼杯盘比估计中的表现。

Result: GPT-4在DR筛查中表现中等（准确率67.5%），在青光眼筛查中表现较差（准确率约78%）。元数据添加对结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: GPT-4可从结构化提示中模拟基本眼科决策，但不适合临床使用，可能适用于教育或文档辅助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

### [8] [Rethinking All Evidence: Enhancing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Conflict-Driven Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01281)
*Juan Chen,Baolong Bi,Wei Zhang,Jingyan Sui,Xiaofei Zhu,Yuanzhuo Wang,Lingrui Mei,Shenghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE-RAG通过冲突驱动的证据总结提升RAG系统的可靠性，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因知识冲突导致的生成不可靠问题。

Method: 提出CARE-RAG框架，包括参数感知证据、上下文感知证据和冲突驱动总结。

Result: 在噪声或冲突证据场景下表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG显著提升了RAG系统的可信度和生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

### [9] [Frustratingly Simple Retrieval Improves Challenging, Reasoning-Intensive Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01297)
*Xinxi Lyu,Michael Duan,Rulin Shao,Pang Wei Koh,Sewon Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CompactDS，一个高质量、多样化的网络规模数据存储，显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）在推理密集型任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG在推理密集型任务中表现有限，缺乏与预训练数据广度对齐的高质量数据存储。

Method: 引入CompactDS，通过过滤低质量内容并结合内存近似最近邻（ANN）与磁盘精确搜索，实现高效检索。

Result: CompactDS在多个基准测试（如MMLU、GPQA）中显著提升RAG性能，相对增益达10%-33%。

Conclusion: CompactDS证明了高质量多样化数据存储的重要性，其性能优于复杂代理系统，同时保持简单性和可复现性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

### [10] [La RoSA: Enhancing LLM Efficiency via Layerwise Rotated Sparse Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01299)
*Kai Liu,Bowen Xu,Shaoyu Wu,Xin Chen,Hao Zhou,Yongliang Tao,Lulu Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaRoSA是一种新的激活稀疏化方法，通过层间正交旋转优化LLM推理效率，无需额外训练或基于幅度的剪枝，实现稳定的加速和性能保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要耗时恢复训练或依赖经验性剪枝，导致稀疏性波动和加速不稳定，LaRoSA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并通过Top-K选择实现一致稀疏性和加速。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏度下仅0.17困惑度差距，1.30倍加速，零样本任务准确率差距仅0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA在多种LLM上表现优异，性能损失小且加速稳定，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

Result: 模型在复杂物理问题上达到最先进准确率，并展现出独特的符号推导模式；少量提示策略可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 指令调优推理模型在物理推理中表现卓越，且通过策略性提示仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Navigating the complexities of physics reasoning has long been a difficult
task for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring a synthesis of profound
conceptual understanding and adept problem-solving techniques. In this study,
we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models,
such as Deepseek-R1, to address a diverse spectrum of physics problems curated
from the challenging SciBench benchmark. Our comprehensive experimental
evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do
they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics
questions, but they also generate distinctive reasoning patterns that emphasize
on symbolic derivation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even for these
highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot
prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy,
highlighting the potential for continued performance gains.

Motivation: 探索逆向语言模型作为基础模型的潜力，并展示其独特能力。

Method: 训练2B和7B参数的逆向语言模型，基于逆向时序预测前一个token，并应用于逆向奖励任务。

Result: LEDOM在数学推理任务中通过逆向奖励显著提升性能，展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LEDOM, the first purely reverse language model, trained
autoregressively on 435B tokens with 2B and 7B parameter variants, which
processes sequences in reverse temporal order through previous token
prediction. For the first time, we present the reverse language model as a
potential foundational model across general tasks, accompanied by a set of
intriguing examples and insights. Based on LEDOM, we further introduce a novel
application: Reverse Reward, where LEDOM-guided reranking of forward language
model outputs leads to substantial performance improvements on mathematical
reasoning tasks. This approach leverages LEDOM's unique backward reasoning
capability to refine generation quality through posterior evaluation. Our
findings suggest that LEDOM exhibits unique characteristics with broad
application potential. We will release all models, training code, and
pre-training data to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SynPref-40M大规模偏好数据集和Skywork-Reward-V2奖励模型，通过人机协同数据标注和高质量数据筛选，显著提升了奖励模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在评估基准上表现不佳，主要源于偏好数据集的局限性（如范围狭窄、标签合成或质量控制不足）。

Method: 设计了一个两阶段人机协同标注流程，结合人类标注质量与AI扩展性，并训练了Skywork-Reward-V2系列模型。

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，验证了数据规模与高质量筛选的重要性。

Conclusion: 人机协同数据标注和高质数据筛选是提升奖励模型性能的关键，Skywork-Reward-V2系列展示了这一潜力。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理真实临床文本提供了高效算法基础，对多标签医学文本建模具有实际意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling
tasks.

*Tianyu Liu,Qitan Lv,Hao Li,Xing Gao,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitSpec是一种无需训练、即插即用的方法，通过扩展检索范围并利用最后一个token的logit推测后续token，显著提升了检索式推测解码的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索式推测解码方法因匹配范围有限，难以找到准确的前瞻token，影响了加速效果。

Method: LogitSpec分两步生成前瞻token：1) 利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个token；2) 检索与推测token相关的参考内容。

Result: 实验表明，LogitSpec在多种文本生成任务中实现了最高2.61倍的加速，平均每解码步骤接受3.28个token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec通过改进检索机制，显著提升了推测解码的效率，且易于集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的方法，用于个性化LLM驱动的文本简化系统，通过目标群体（智力障碍人士）的反馈优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的文本简化系统缺乏个性化，未考虑目标群体的偏好反馈。

Method: 结合监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO），利用目标群体的反馈数据优化模型。

Result: 研究强调了目标群体参与设计个性化AI解决方案的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化包容性AI系统提供了方向，结合专家和目标群体的反馈。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了全局评分和成对比较在NLP模型评估中的优劣，发现全局评分更可靠但可能低估某些模型，而成对比较能识别低分模型中的强者，但收敛较慢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着指令调优神经语言模型的发展，NLP评估逐渐从全局评分转向成对比较。本文旨在比较两种方法的优缺点，以帮助选择合适的评估策略。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据集的计算实验，使用标准全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行成对比较。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的总体排名，但可能低估某些模型；成对比较能识别低分模型中的强者，但收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 两种评估方法各有优劣，选择应基于具体需求。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合不确定性建模与微调大语言模型（LLM）的模块化框架，用于高效准确地检测任务导向对话系统中的超出范围（OOS）意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务导向对话系统（TODS）中OOS意图检测对处理未知和模糊查询至关重要，现有方法在计算效率和性能上存在不足。

Method: 分两步：首先对已部署的意图分类器输出进行不确定性估计，其次对高不确定性实例触发微调LLM进行最终决策。

Result: 在关键OOS检测基准测试中取得最优结果，包括实际部署系统中的真实数据。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡计算效率与性能，结合传统方法与LLM，为OOS检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

### [19] [Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01543)
*Quang Minh Nguyen,Taegyoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在立场检测任务中，外部信息（如维基百科和网络搜索）通常会降低大型语言模型（LLM）的性能，而非提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨外部信息对LLM在立场检测任务中的影响，验证其是否如BERT等模型一样能提升性能。

Method: 在三个数据集和12个目标上，系统评估了八种LLM使用维基百科和网络搜索外部信息的效果。

Result: 外部信息在多数情况下会降低LLM的性能，宏F1分数下降高达27.9%，且LLM倾向于与外部信息的立场和情感对齐。

Conclusion: 外部信息在LLM中可能引入偏见，导致性能下降，这与BERT等模型的结论相反，提示需谨慎使用外部信息。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言流畅性和上下文理解上有显著进步，但构建高效且情感智能的任务导向对话系统仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出LUSTER系统，结合LLM能力和结构化奖励模型，通过短长期奖励优化对话系统。

Result: 实验表明，LUSTER能构建更具韧性和情感响应的对话系统。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与结构化奖励模型为下一代对话系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

Conclusion: 建议在临床环境中优先选择JSON格式，并优化提示设计以提高解析性。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from

Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言中的迁移能力，以解决资源匮乏问题。

Method: 使用印尼单语BERT、多语言模型（mBERT、XLM-R）和适配器方法（MAD-X），将目标语言分为三类（已见、部分见、未见）进行评估。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言表现最佳，适配器方法显著提升性能；语言先验接触是迁移成功的主要预测因素。

Conclusion: 适配器方法有效提升低资源语言性能，语言先验接触是关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

Result: 实验表明，AdamMeme能系统揭示不同mLLMs的性能差异，并分析模型特定弱点。

Conclusion: AdamMeme为mLLMs的有害表情包理解提供了灵活且深入的评估工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

Motivation: 语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象可能对敏感领域（如内容审核和决策）造成危害，因此需要有效检测方法。

Method: 通过联合学习偏见和刻板印象检测任务，使用StereoBias数据集，比较了编码器模型和解码器模型的性能。

Result: 联合训练显著提升了偏见检测性能，且解码器模型表现与编码器模型相当。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息可以构建更公平、更有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战和机会，但现有数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其在动态法律环境中的应用。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，利用LLMs和上下文学习评估合同条款的合法性，比较了三种法律背景变体对模型性能的影响。

Result: 完整法律文本略微提升模型性能，而简化的考试指南显著提高了无效条款的召回率和加权F1分数（80%），但LLMs表现仍远低于人类律师。

Conclusion: LLMs在辅助律师合同合法性审查方面具有潜力，但当前方法仍存在局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型在复杂环境中的冲突信号提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动医疗编码可简化文档和计费流程，但缺乏透明性评估，MDACE数据集为此提供了资源。

Method: 对MDACE数据集进行深入分析，评估现有可解释医疗编码系统的合理性，并提出匹配度量。

Result: 真实证据与代码描述部分一致，先进方法与真实证据高度重叠。

Conclusion: 提出了开发和评估可解释医疗编码系统的建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，理解训练数据如何影响其输出对透明度、责任、隐私和公平性至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于低困惑度序列分析的管道，可靠地提取并追踪这些序列到训练数据源。

Result: 发现大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练数据，对匹配序列的分布进行了量化分析。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于更好地理解LLMs训练数据对其行为的影响。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

TL;DR: DIY-MKG是一个开源系统，支持多语言学习，通过个性化词汇知识图谱和动态测验生成解决现有工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言学习工具在多语言词汇联系、个性化学习和认知卸载方面存在不足。

Method: 设计DIY-MKG系统，利用LLM构建个性化词汇知识图谱，并提供动态测验和反馈机制。

Result: 评估显示词汇扩展可靠且多语言公平，生成的测验高度准确。

Conclusion: DIY-MKG通过个性化学习和反馈机制有效提升多语言学习效果。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiCoTA框架通过中间规模模型和中间长度推理序列，提升小语言模型的长链推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型（SLMs）因容量限制难以学习长链推理（CoT）的问题。

Method: 使用中间规模模型作为教师助手，利用中间长度推理序列弥合容量和推理长度差距。

Result: 实验显示，MiCoTA显著提升SLMs的推理性能，如Qwen2.5-7B和3B模型在多个基准测试中平均得分提高3.47和3.93。

Conclusion: MiCoTA为SLMs的长链推理数据蒸馏提供了新思路，未来可进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

Motivation: 传统剪枝方法忽视注意力头在网络架构中的位置，导致性能下降，需改进。

Method: 策略性剪枝高层注意力头，引入自适应重缩放参数校准表示尺度。

Result: 在27个数据集上验证，生成任务表现显著优于现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升大语言模型剪枝性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor

Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Motivation: 当前RLHF技术在解决多样化且可能冲突的人类偏好对齐问题时存在挑战。

Method: 提出GAPO和P-GAPO方法，利用多梯度下降和梯度自适应缩放技术，优化多目标冲突问题。

Result: 理论证明GAPO收敛于帕累托最优解，实验显示其在Mistral-7B上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAPO和P-GAPO为多样化人类偏好对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

Motivation: 研究教师模型的哪种推理演示最有效提升学生模型的推理能力。

Method: 从教师模型中精选高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），分析影响蒸馏效果的因素，如样本效率和多样性。

Result: NaturalThoughts在多个推理基准测试（如GPQA-Diamond、MMLU-Pro等）上优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: 精选高难度、多样化的推理示例能更高效地提升学生模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自然语言生成（NLG）的评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与实际决策效果相关性低，需要更直接的评估方式。

Method: 通过市场摘要文本（客观晨报和主观收盘分析）测试生成文本对人类和大型语言模型（LLM）决策的影响，评估决策质量。

Result: 人类和LLM单独依赖摘要时表现不优于随机；但人机协作结合更丰富的分析评论能显著超越单独表现。

Conclusion: 生成文本的评估应关注其促进人机协同决策的能力，传统内在评估指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在辩论中的表现及其对对话结构的理解，以揭示其作为评估者的局限性。

Method: 通过测试LLMs的辩论能力及其对对话结构和语用背景的理解。

Result: LLMs能进行有说服力的辩论，但无法展示对对话深层结构的理解。

Conclusion: LLMs的辩论能力不依赖于对内容的真正理解，语用背景和连贯性建模对效果是次要的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

Result: 河内塔实验中，LRMs在复杂度增加时表现受限；河流穿越实验中，LRMs在可解配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: LRMs是受限于认知能力的搜索器，未来需要在符号推理和长期规划方面进一步研究。

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际临床环境中未能显著提升诊断效果，因此需要探索其局限性并改进方法。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析了LLMs在临床中的局限性，并提出了结合统计学习和专家规则的混合方法。

Result: 研究发现，纯数据驱动的LLMs缺乏透明度和可解释性，而混合方法（如PEIRS和ATHENA-CDS）更符合临床工作流程。

Conclusion: 未来的AI决策支持系统应注重解释性和临床实用性，结合神经符号AI和人类因果推理，同时关注临床工作流程和患者结果。

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents
(MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in
information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous

LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential
applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential
challenges they may face.

Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large
university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an
AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned
scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus
narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve
supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final
feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and
has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and
empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science,
Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces
grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate
with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究同时处理工具调用和推理过程，导致模型负担过重。

Method: 采用分层框架，分离工具调用与推理过程，由不同代理处理。

Result: 在少量样本微调后取得优异表现，Bamboogle任务中超越Search-R1。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效减轻模型负担，提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法在建模训练与测试样本间的事件分布偏移和负采样质量上存在不足。

Method: 提出T3DM方法，结合测试时训练指导的分布偏移建模和基于对抗训练的高质量负采样策略。

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法，结果更优且更鲁棒。

Conclusion: T3DM通过改进分布偏移建模和负采样策略，显著提升了TKG推理的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based
business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and
agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural
Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the
agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea
quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs
with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by
unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

Method: 采用马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）模型，结合神经近似动态规划（NeurADP）和深度双Q网络（DDQN）进行动态定价和订单分配优化。

Result: 实验显示，NeurADP + DDQN策略比固定定价节省6.7%成本，比短视基准节省18%；灵活配送和多目的地路由进一步降低成本8%和17%。

Conclusion: 动态前瞻性策略在众包配送系统中具有显著优势，为城市物流运营商提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

Method: 方法包括：1) 分析传统条件的局限性；2) 改进Gelfond答案集原则，引入良好支持性和最小性；3) 定义新的答案集语义；4) 评估现有语义；5) 计算复杂性分析。

Result: 结果表明传统条件有时过于严格，改进的Gelfond原则能更合理地定义答案集语义，并支持更广泛的预期答案集。

Conclusion: 结论是改进的Gelfond答案集原则为答案集语义提供了更灵活和合理的通用条件，可作为评估现有语义的基准。

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

Conclusion: 这是首次在超声心动图领域应用DPR进行患者队列检索的研究，为其他医学领域提供了可借鉴的框架。

Abstract: Patient cohort retrieval is a pivotal task in medical research and clinical
practice, enabling the identification of specific patient groups from extensive
electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we address the challenge of
cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain by applying Dense Passage
Retrieval (DPR), a prominent methodology in semantic search. We propose a
systematic approach to transform an echocardiographic EHR dataset of
unstructured nature into a Query-Passage dataset, framing the problem as a
Cohort Retrieval task. Additionally, we design and implement evaluation metrics
inspired by real-world clinical scenarios to rigorously test the models across
diverse retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we present a custom-trained DPR embedding
model that demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional and
off-the-shelf SOTA methods.To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply
DPR for patient cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain, establishing a
framework that can be adapted to other medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床数据集（如MIMIC-IV）因技术复杂性而难以有效利用的问题。

Method: 通过Model Context Protocol (MCP)将自然语言问题转换为SQL查询，并执行查询返回结果。

Result: M3显著减少了复杂队列分析的时间和技能要求，提升了数据可访问性。

Conclusion: M3为更广泛的研究社区提供了便捷的临床数据分析工具，加速了数据转化为洞察的过程。

Abstract: As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to
unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest
open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets,
particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to
understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant
barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to
understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves
MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the
hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers
converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural
language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query
against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the
underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show
that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that
once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the
complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the
broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates
the translation of raw records into actionable insight.

Abstract: The judiciary, as one of democracy's three pillars, is dealing with a rising
amount of legal issues, needing careful use of judicial resources. This
research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science
methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta
High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the
creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts
into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an
intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal
professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model
using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the
summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves
crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector
database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases
in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This
technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal
professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information,
benefiting the overall legal scenario.

Abstract: Online dating platforms have fundamentally transformed the formation of
romantic relationships, with millions of users worldwide relying on algorithmic
matching systems to find compatible partners. However, current recommendation
systems in dating applications suffer from significant algorithmic
deficiencies, including but not limited to popularity bias, filter bubble
effects, and inadequate reciprocity modeling that limit effectiveness and
introduce harmful biases. This research integrates foundational work with
recent empirical findings to deliver a detailed analysis of dating app
recommendation systems, highlighting key issues and suggesting research-backed
solutions. Through analysis of reciprocal recommendation frameworks, fairness
evaluation metrics, and industry implementations, we demonstrate that current
systems achieve modest performance with collaborative filtering reaching 25.1\%
while reciprocal methods achieve 28.7\%. Our proposed mathematical framework
addresses these limitations through enhanced similarity measures,
multi-objective optimization, and fairness-aware algorithms that maintain
competitive accuracy while improving demographic representation to reduce

Result: 离线实验中，EBR将ROC-AUC从0.85提升到0.99，PR-AUC从0.35提升到0.95；在线实验中，行动率提高了10.32%，运营成本降低了80%。

Conclusion: EBR方法在视频内容审核中表现出高效性、灵活性和可解释性，优于传统分类方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short
video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While
classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often
struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as
trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an
Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional
classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both
single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior
performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and
MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the
embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video
retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive
offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves
ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online
experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces
operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and
flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注推荐系统的整体性能，而解释质量的评估多依赖主观用户研究，缺乏客观指标。

Method: 将Veracity分解为Fidelity和Attunement，应用信号检测理论计算敏感性作为最终值，并通过四种不同信息质量的案例验证。

Result: 验证了所提指标能有效捕捉解释质量的差异。

Conclusion: 提出的客观指标为评估推荐系统解释质量提供了新方法。

Abstract: There is growing interest in explainable recommender systems that provide
recommendations along with explanations for the reasoning behind them. When
evaluating recommender systems, most studies focus on overall recommendation
performance. Only a few assess the quality of the explanations. Explanation
quality is often evaluated through user studies that subjectively gather users'
opinions on representative explanatory factors that shape end-users'
perspective towards the results, not about the explanation contents itself. We
aim to fill this gap by developing an objective metric to evaluate Veracity:
the information quality of explanations. Specifically, we decompose Veracity
into two dimensions: Fidelity and Attunement. Fidelity refers to whether the
explanation includes accurate information about the recommended item.
Attunement evaluates whether the explanation reflects the target user's
preferences. By applying signal detection theory, we first determine decision
outcomes for each dimension and then combine them to calculate a sensitivity,
which serves as the final Veracity value. To assess the effectiveness of the
proposed metric, we set up four cases with varying levels of information
quality to validate whether our metric can accurately capture differences in
quality. The results provided meaningful insights into the effectiveness of our
proposed metric.

Abstract: Federated recommendation (FedRec) preserves user privacy by enabling
decentralized training of personalized models, but this architecture is
inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Significant research has been
conducted on targeted attacks in FedRec systems, motivated by commercial and
social influence considerations. However, much of this work has largely
overlooked the differential robustness of recommendation models. Moreover, our
empirical findings indicate that existing targeted attack methods achieve only
limited effectiveness in Federated Sequential Recommendation(FSR) tasks. Driven
by these observations, we focus on investigating targeted attacks in FSR and
propose a novel dualview attack framework, named DV-FSR. This attack method
uniquely combines a sampling-based explicit strategy with a contrastive
learning-based implicit gradient strategy to orchestrate a coordinated attack.
Additionally, we introduce a specific defense mechanism tailored for targeted
attacks in FSR, aiming to evaluate the mitigation effects of the attack method
we proposed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach on representative sequential models. Our codes are publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强型影响力感知群组推荐框架（EIGR），通过图提取采样、动态独立级联模型和两级哈希索引，解决了大规模社交图、动态影响传播和实时匹配的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群组推荐在社交媒体流中应用广泛，但现有方法面临社交图规模大、影响传播动态变化和计算开销高的挑战。

Method: 提出EIGR框架，包括图提取采样策略（GES）、动态独立级联模型（DYIC）和两级哈希用户群组索引（UG-Index）。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EIGR在效果和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EIGR框架有效解决了群组推荐中的关键挑战，为实时推荐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Group recommendation over social media streams has attracted significant
attention due to its wide applications in domains such as e-commerce,
entertainment, and online news broadcasting. By leveraging social connections
and group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate
and engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently,
influence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the
impact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we
proposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task.
However, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and
ever-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence
propagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of
real-time group-item matching.
  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group
Recommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based
Sampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social
graphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items.
Second, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict
how influence propagates over time across social items and user groups.
Finally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to
efficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation
generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both effectiveness and efficiency.

*Md Shakil Ahamed Shohag,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Farhad Pourpanah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSIGenZ是一个少样本启发的生成式零样本学习框架，通过动态调整属性评分和原型估计减少对大规模特征合成的依赖，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成式零样本学习方法需要大量计算资源和合成数据，且假设所有属性均匀存在，而实际上属性存在实例级变异性。

Method: 提出MSAS动态调整属性评分，估计组级原型作为合成特征，并引入DPSR策略训练语义感知对比分类器。

Result: 在SUN、AwA2和CUB基准测试中，FSIGenZ使用更少的合成特征实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FSIGenZ通过减少对大规模特征合成的依赖，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual
features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by
training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these
methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic
data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose
FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on
large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes
exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or
partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly
present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),
which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific
optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen
data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based
on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic
features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we
introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training
a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.
Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves
competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

TL;DR: DBellQuant是一种创新的后训练量化框架，通过LTDB算法将单钟形权重分布转换为双钟形形式，实现1位权重压缩和6位激活量化，性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）面临计算和内存限制，量化是解决方案，但量化误差和激活异常值限制了其效果。

Method: 采用LTDB算法，将权重分布转换为双钟形以减少二值化误差，并通过逆变换平滑激活。

Result: 在Wikitext2数据集上，DBellQuant在LLaMA2-13B上实现了14.39的困惑度，优于BiLLM的21.35。

Conclusion: DBellQuant在激进量化的同时保持模型性能，为LLMs的实际应用提供了高效的压缩方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face
substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical
deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its
effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight
distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation
outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight
compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance
degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)
algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell
forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to
smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving
superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.
For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of
14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly
outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its
potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 停止梯度和指数移动平均虽不优化原始目标函数，但能有效避免表示崩溃，为自监督学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to
train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that
minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of
the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop
gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used
to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream
supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from
the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first
show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or
for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following
Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their
proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear
case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop
gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we
finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with
these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no
risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

Conclusion: PathCoT通过专家知识和自评估显著提升了病理视觉推理的准确性。

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet

allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a
specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using
machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar

simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning
algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data
sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2.
Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries
were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine
learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of
each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the
selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced
through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden
layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal
model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons
respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

Abstract: Geometric learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
non-Euclidean data, especially graph-structured ones, with applications
spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and
recommender systems. While Nvidia's CUDA-enabled graphics processing units
(GPUs) largely dominate the hardware landscape, emerging accelerators such as
Intel's Gaudi Habana Processing Units (HPUs) offer competitive performance and
energy efficiency. However, the usage of such non-CUDA processing units
requires significant engineering effort and novel software adaptations. In this
work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning
frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that
restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest
neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and
eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and
detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible
GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to
experiment with geometric-learning algorithms and models on non-CUDA hardware,
providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的多视图动态决策框架，用于多组学数据分类，旨在降低测试成本的同时保持高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学分析成本高且可能导致资源浪费，需一种更经济高效的分类方法。

Method: 在单组学层面，通过改进神经网络激活函数生成Dirichlet分布参数，量化分类结果的置信度和不确定性；在多组学层面，基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合异构数据，动态决策逐步引入数据直至满足置信度阈值。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证，50%以上病例仅需单组学数据即可准确分类，显著减少冗余测试，同时保持与全组学模型相当的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低成本的同时保持了诊断准确性和生物学意义，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have
proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early
diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a
significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially
leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we
propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics
data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while
minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy
planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding,
generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study
proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and
deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by
instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were
applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential
smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier
smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared
error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute
percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong
capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key
contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates
exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance
in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical
insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load
management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their
inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used:
hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization,
LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2.
Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA +
DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms
of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in
comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as
accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design
and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM
approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as
LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning
along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy
preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning

Result: L2Seg将求解器加速7倍，NAR与AR协同效果最佳。

Conclusion: L2Seg兼容多种求解器，适用于广泛VRP问题。

Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for
solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit
a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution
remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant
computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address
this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)
decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA
preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within
each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable
portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be
aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),
a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and
unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:
non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),
autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,
with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and
VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up
to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy
achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably,
L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional,
learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Dist-FedAvg在推荐准确性上优于基线聚合技术。

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg有效解决了传统聚合方法的局限性，同时与现有联邦学习框架无缝集成。

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy

that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS),
our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable
on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1
environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance
against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained
fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000
updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training
and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a
promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in
reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core
problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes
a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced
assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal
model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This
article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing
and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the
paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that
allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained.
The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a
Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows
to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The
proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets,
demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series
classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt
dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The
approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility.
Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series
classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the
method's robustness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖同质数据集和静态定制模型，限制了其在多样化临床环境中的适用性。

Method: 利用Transformer架构和生成式掩码预训练策略，整合多模态数据（包括MIMIC-III-WDB、MIMIC-IV-ECG和CODE数据集）进行预训练。

Result: CSFM在多种心脏感知任务中表现优于传统单模态单任务方法，并支持跨输入配置和传感器模态的迁移学习。

Conclusion: CSFM是一种多功能、可扩展的解决方案，适用于全面的心脏监测。

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,
limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings
and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing
foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字孪生技术缺乏实时实现的关键特性、模型不确定性关注不足，且缺乏清晰的模型与资产信息交换框架。

Method: 提出VDT框架，在标准神经网络架构中增加一个贝叶斯输出层，并设计了一种轻量级的更新算法。

Result: 在四个能源领域问题中验证了VDT的有效性，包括临界热通量预测、可再生能源发电预测、核反应堆瞬态冷却和锂离子电池建模。

Conclusion: VDT通过贝叶斯增强和高效更新，将传统代理模型转化为具有不确定性感知、数据高效且计算可行的数字孪生，为能源系统提供了可靠的模型。

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into
complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a
clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks
key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to
model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational
digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a
single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT
updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while
producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,
control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four
energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven
active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third
the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin
maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind
forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A
nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with
R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating
robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion
battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared
error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting
its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results
demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update
schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,
and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across
industrial and scientific energy systems.

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：先用高质量标注数据微调模型，再利用无标注数据和奖励模型通过Group Relative Policy Optimization训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在去毒、语义保留和泛化能力上优于现有方法，且减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法的权衡问题，实现了高效去毒和语义保留。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

Result: 成功实现长序列电影帧的存储与检索，展示了在Transformer架构中的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该模型为长上下文任务提供了新思路，对自然语言处理和时间序列分析有重要意义。

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence
memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves
exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon
earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal
kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient
sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the
successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential
retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high
dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between
even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has
applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient
long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal
bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our
model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in
long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language
processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Result: 预训练显著加速收敛（最高4.2倍），并提高了准确性和表示质量，多模态性能在大数据集下表现更优。

Conclusion: 为材料科学提供了一种无需结构输入、基于实验数据的基础模型路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based
models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for
computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world
applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain.
We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental
composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities
in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our
architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention
fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We
present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as
self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence
(up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We
further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with
dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data
regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally
grounded foundation models for materials science.

Conclusion: 建议改进排水系统、使用抗洪材料及预防性维护，提升路面抗洪能力。

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both
immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research
investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically
focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index
(IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition
data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data,
including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to
compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration
rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of
flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected
pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded
sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation
strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and
preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Conclusion: 该方法为药物发现和材料设计中的3D分子信息处理提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks
run also through workflow management systems.

Result: 提出了一种可适应不同ECU通信用例的LLM架构，提高了检测准确性，并减少了手动标注的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式解码器模型，提供了一种可扩展且高效的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with
limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems
where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large
Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs
tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth
data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection
simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an
entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known
anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution
offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to
handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU
communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of
decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost
and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that
is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection
accuracy in complex communication environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.
This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information

*Edouard Lansiaux,Ramy Azzouz,Emmanuel Chazard,Amélie Vromant,Eric Wiel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究比较了三种AI模型（NLP、LLM、JEPA）在急诊分诊中的表现，发现LLM模型（URGENTIAPARSE）在准确性上优于其他模型和护士分诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决急诊科分诊错误（如过低或过高分诊）的问题，尤其是在患者流量增加和人员短缺的情况下。

Method: 通过回顾性分析前瞻性收集的急诊患者数据，训练并验证三种AI模型（NLP、LLM、JEPA），比较其与FRENCH标准和临床实践的预测一致性。

Result: LLM模型（URGENTIAPARSE）在分诊预测中表现最佳（综合得分2.514），优于JEPA和NLP模型，且比护士分诊更准确。

Conclusion: 将AI整合到急诊工作流程中可提升患者安全和运营效率，但需解决模型局限性和伦理透明度问题。

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent
challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and
staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage
protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI
models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes
against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage
data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).
Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)
URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic
details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on
the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of
AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks
to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM
model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared
to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse
triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness
with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for
FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient
representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested
models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and
operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires
addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

*Liu Ziyin,Isaac Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文详细解释了Ziyin等人（2025年）关于嵌入式深度线性网络模型（EDLN）的“完美”柏拉图表示假设（PRH）的证明。研究发现，通过SGD训练，不同宽度和深度的EDLN在不同数据上训练后会达到完美柏拉图状态，即每对层学习相同的表示（仅旋转差异）。由于损失函数的大多数全局最小值并非柏拉图解，SGD仅找到完美柏拉图解的现象非常特殊。此外，研究还提出了至少六种破坏PRH的方式，并揭示了柏拉图表示的出现与渐进锐化现象的共同原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习中的柏拉图表示假设（PRH）及其在EDLN模型中的表现，揭示SGD训练中出现的特殊现象及其与渐进锐化的联系。

Method: 通过理论分析和证明，详细解释Ziyin等人的工作，并探讨SGD训练下EDLN模型的柏拉图表示形成机制。

Result: 发现SGD训练会导致EDLN模型达到完美柏拉图状态，且这一现象与渐进锐化有共同原因。同时提出了破坏PRH的多种方式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解SGD训练中不可逆性导致的“熵力”及其在表示学习中的重要性，为深度学习理论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin
et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the
embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,
two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will
become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will
learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global
minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly
Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six
ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence
of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of
progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated
phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the
theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic
forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in
representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid
lengthy technical details.

Abstract: The scientific computation methods development in conjunction with artificial

between lightweight and accurate computations is a solid foundation for this
direction. The study presents a neural operator based on the dynamic mode
decomposition algorithm (DMD), mapping functional spaces, which combines DMD
and deep learning (DL) for spatiotemporal processes efficient modeling. Solving
PDEs for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant
computational resources. The method suggested automatically extracts key modes
and system dynamics using them to construct predictions, reducing computational
costs compared to traditional numerical methods. The approach has demonstrated
its efficiency through comparative analysis of performance with closest
analogues DeepONet and FNO in the heat equation, Laplaces equation, and Burgers
equation solutions approximation, where it achieves high reconstruction
accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 球形噪声在差分隐私训练中削弱了自适应优化器的性能，现有研究多基于简单任务，结论可能不具普适性。

Method: 调查了多种改进算法，进行理论分析和实证比较，重点关注“scale-then-privatize”技术。

Result: 发现追求梯度二阶矩无偏估计的直觉是错误的，“scale-then-privatize”在理论和实践中表现更优。

Conclusion: “scale-then-privatize”技术更匹配实际需求，优于其他方法，尤其在小型语言模型训练中。

Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP)
training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and
Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this
challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks
and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in
practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better
theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing
them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of
second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead
that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve
unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and
outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model
training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise
addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which
are more desirable to use in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SO(3)-等变网络在机器学习原子间势能（MLIPs）中占主导，但其关键操作Clebsch-Gordan张量积计算成本高，需要优化。

Method: 提出张量分解网络（TDNs），用低秩张量分解（如CP分解）替代Clebsch-Gordan张量积，并引入路径权重共享进一步减少参数。

Result: TDNs在PubChemQCR、OC20和OC22数据集上表现优异，计算复杂度从O(L^6)降至O(L^4)，显著加速。

Conclusion: TDNs作为即插即用的替代方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率，适用于现有网络。

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is
the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To
accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as
a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are
replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the
induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of
approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of
parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space
weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising
equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts
as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and
the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to
$O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation
dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing
datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive
performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据在科学领域中普遍存在，但现有研究在目标值范围不平衡回归问题上存在显著不足，尤其是对科学价值高的区域关注不够。

Method: SMH方法通过生成合成图样本，保留拓扑特性并专注于目标分布中低代表区域，解决了传统方法忽视图拓扑或未针对特定域范围的问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，SMH在化学和药物发现基准数据集上显著提升了目标域范围的预测性能。

Conclusion: SMH为解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题提供了一种有效方法，尤其在关注特定科学价值区域时表现优异。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

TL;DR: FlashDP是一种创新的缓存友好型DP-SGD方法，通过单次融合计算梯度，显著减少内存占用和冗余计算，同时保持隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，训练数据的隐私保护成为关键问题。现有DP-SGD方法在内存和计算效率上存在不足。

Method: 提出FlashDP，一种缓存友好的逐层DP-SGD方法，通过单次融合计算梯度，减少内存移动和冗余计算。

Result: FlashDP减少50%内存移动和20%冗余计算，在Llama-13B预训练中达到非DP方法90%的吞吐量，且精度与标准DP-SGD相当。

Conclusion: FlashDP为高效且隐私保护的LLM训练提供了重要突破，其代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological
advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern.
Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data,
yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
(DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities
of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,
necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating
memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage
needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies
due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative
cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a
single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach
not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down
redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods.
Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a
\textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system
during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with
standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements
establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving
training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in

Conclusion: Diffusion Explorer为理解扩散模型提供了直观且易于使用的工具，填补了现有资源的不足。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been central to the development of recent image, video,
and even text generation systems. They posses striking geometric properties
that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing
resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical
foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their
rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool
to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D
diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their
sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has
been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic
systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent
stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source
and a live demo is available at alechelbling.com/Diffusion-Explorer.

TL;DR: 当前大型脑波基础模型（LBMs）在脑机接口（BCI）任务中表现有限，仅比传统深度架构略有提升（0.9%-1.2%），但参数需求显著增加。通过LoRA技术，可以大幅减少可训练参数而不损失性能，表明LBMs当前存在架构和训练效率问题。

Motivation: 评估LBMs在脑波建模中的能力，探索其在BCI任务中的效率和适用性。

Result: LBMs性能提升有限，参数需求高；LoRA能有效减少参数且不降低性能。

Conclusion: LBMs需针对BCI任务优化架构和训练策略，当前模型可能需要重新设计以发挥潜力。

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various
domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave
modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current
Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning
experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,
including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis
shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)
over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more
parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their
efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce
trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that
architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our
experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI
applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that
performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network
components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for
domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current
architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of
foundation models in brainwave analysis.

Conclusion: JAM框架为独立训练的视觉和语言模型提供了有效的对齐方法，支持柏拉图表示假设，并为多模态模型的发展提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive
Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary
infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are
subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection
attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often
designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in
real time. In this work, we propose to evaluate and apply fast neural network
inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on
low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can
achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4,
with AUCROC values of 0.9890.

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by
on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data
and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted
methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local
mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation
transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the
server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and
efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via
server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and
improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the
server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves
the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring
data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a
one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a
single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the
side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive
adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules
based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth
labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network
computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine

required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine
learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect
pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this
purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature
map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and
an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset
consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude
and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The
QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a
low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the
classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,
making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM训练提供了一种更高效的优化策略，显著提升了训练效果。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly
being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical
evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper
proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive
sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves
faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability
compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis
to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate
subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like
algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key
advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity
and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a
detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show
that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the
scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the
speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a
model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a
way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs)
and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have
been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in
LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for
LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn
fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we
introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by
introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for
analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)
Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then
evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal
that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired
through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during
pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data
in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same
data are split and unlearned sequentially.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维随机控制问题因维度灾难难以解决，传统动态规划方法效率低，需寻找替代方案。

Method: 引入神经哈密顿算子（NHO），通过神经网络参数化FBSDE系统，训练网络以符合PMP一致性条件。

Result: 证明了NHO在一般鞅驱动下的通用逼近能力，并分析了优化挑战。

Conclusion: NHO为高维随机控制问题提供了深度学习解决方案，并建立了统计推断的理论框架。

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to
solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic
programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem
as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep
learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This
operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that
represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial
gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying
networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting
this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the
rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning
an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove
the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale
drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization
challenges inherent to this class of models.

Motivation: 上下文学习（ICL）因其适应性和无参数特性在大型语言模型（LLMs）中表现优异，但也易受后门攻击。本文旨在揭示其脆弱性并提出防御方案。

Method: 提出双学习假设，分析后门影响上界，并设计ICLShield机制，通过置信度和相似度动态选择干净示例。

Result: 实验表明ICLShield在多种LLMs和任务中平均提升26.02%防御效果，对闭源模型（如GPT-4）也表现优异。

Conclusion: ICLShield通过动态调整概念偏好比例，有效防御后门攻击，具有广泛适应性和卓越性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature.
However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the
dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the
task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned
demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through
theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,
revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio
between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference
ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL
phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating
susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs
and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense
effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on
average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and
defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly
challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of
customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business
scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel
Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that
leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for
abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum
learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more
challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively
addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD
transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show
that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness,
attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an
average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a
superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models,
contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

Motivation: 现有全球降水数据（如IMERG）分辨率较低（10 km），无法满足水文建模和极端天气分析的需求。

Method: WDM是一种条件扩散模型，直接在小波域中学习降水数据的复杂结构，通过关注高频小波系数生成1 km分辨率的降水场。

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand
precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly
finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To
address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative
framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and
delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a
conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of
precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing
on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic
and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces
visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and
delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and
speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable
hydrological forecasts.

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential

However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose

\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine
to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with
quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired
by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates
additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its
associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step
process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack
variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for
higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of
predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the
introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.
Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate
models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在处理结合连续和离散特征的上下文学习任务时的能力，特别是其在关联召回和状态预测中的表现。

Method: 预训练Transformer模型于符号标记的随机线性确定性动态系统样本，分析其在上下文标签提示下的状态召回和预测能力。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理复杂上下文学习任务时涉及多机制，且这些机制的学习动态存在差异，这一现象不仅限于玩具问题。

Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of
linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete
associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this
toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from
randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the
transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its
context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking
a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two
functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that
system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system
to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first
capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second
capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much
earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model
weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy
problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the
discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the
start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,
which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a
"Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These
two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase
transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used
OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar
phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs
second-task-token performance.

Conclusion: Prefix-RFT为LLM后训练提供了新视角，表明结合演示和探索的统一范式是未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

Motivation: RISC-V向量扩展（RVV）在AI工作负载加速中具有潜力，但缺乏智能方法（如自动调优框架）的集成，限制了其高效部署。

Method: 将RVV扩展集成到TVM的MetaSchedule框架中，通过概率程序框架调优张量操作，并在FPGA上实现多种RISC-V SoC进行验证。

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging
from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its
RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI
workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of
RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the
autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like
muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing
the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the
efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a
workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V
vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the
RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program
framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on
an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our
proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared
against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.
Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory
footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also
evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the
RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that
are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our
proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In
our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential

Conclusion: BBoxER是梯度优化的有效补充，适用于隐私敏感和高风险场景。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

Result: 结果表明，现有算法无法有效利用这些动态，且学习性能对子目标完成与最终奖励的时间接近性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前方法存在根本性限制，需要开发能够推断潜在任务结构而不依赖即时奖励的机制。

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of
rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We
identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness
of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly
yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive
dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that
state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics
and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity
between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for
mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate
incentives.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their
widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they
consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a
practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

Motivation: 扩散模型作为强大的生成模型，其损失函数的选择是关键问题。已有多种目标函数被提出，但缺乏系统性的比较和统一理解。

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型的损失函数提供了统一理解，有助于未来更高效和针对性的模型设计。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

Method: 采用共享主干网络和任务特定头，结合自监督过程奖励模型（SPRM），实现高效推理和可控思考长度。

Result: MetaStone-S1性能与OpenAI-o3-mini系列相当，参数规模显著减少，支持测试时扩展（TTS）。

Conclusion: MetaStone-S1展示了高效推理和可扩展性潜力，已开源以支持研究社区。

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model
(SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for
next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with
only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have
open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable
energy challenges. For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested,
highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However,
reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high
sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works
have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting
environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy
problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic
simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated
training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios
based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines.
Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over
100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular

Conclusion: MARVIS提供了一种无需训练、保护隐私的多模态预测方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized
models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent
performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but
typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional
modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive
Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small
vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS
transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then
leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully
interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision,
audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model,
achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized
methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or
requiring any domain-specific training. We open source our code and datasets at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索zapping在持续学习和迁移学习中的有效性及其背后的机制。

Method: 在卷积神经网络中，通过手写字符和自然图像实验，分析zapping和优化器选择对学习和遗忘模式的影响。

Result: zapping能帮助模型更快适应新领域；优化器的选择也会显著影响任务间的学习与遗忘动态。

Conclusion: zapping和优化器选择在持续学习中起关键作用，影响任务间的协同与干扰。

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.

Conclusion: 联邦学习为隐私增强的室内定位提供了可行方案，推动安全高效定位系统的发展。

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet
of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often
produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data
collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising
solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically
require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server
reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the
nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy,
bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that
our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor
localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor
localization systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that
leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters. We
provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and
without Nesterov momentum, and with and without weight decay. We then show that
adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and
gradient norms, and we clarify the relationship between the weight decay
coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive Muon's critical batch
size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is
the stochastic computational cost, and validate our theoretical findings with

Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based
sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped
to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual
dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel
algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update
mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low
computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains
show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary
learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of
batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.

Result: GradMetaNet能够逼近自然梯度函数，并在多项任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GradMetaNet为梯度处理任务提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,
editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients
as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent
works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use
architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,
limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach
for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by
three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation
symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to
capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation
through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce
GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from
simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and
show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based
functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness
on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as
learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

Conclusion: AsyncFlow为下一代RL训练系统设计提供了可行方案，具有高效性和模块化优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the
post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated
RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while
task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the
corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing
frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making
it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,
we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient
post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and
transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained
scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently
facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load
balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow
engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring
parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core
capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training
and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,
offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments
demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with
state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides
actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

Motivation: 现有审计技术仅能识别潜在的不良行为，而本文旨在解决事后分析和检测虚假输出的需求。

Method: 将精确输入重构形式化为离散优化问题，并引入SODA算法，通过梯度搜索和参数衰减实现高效重构。

Result: 在33M到3B参数的LLM上，SODA显著优于现有方法，成功重构79.5%的短输入，但对长输入（15+ token）效果有限。

Conclusion: 标准部署实践可能已足够防止恶意使用SODA，但需进一步研究长输入的重构问题。

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted
behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary
forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM
output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake
output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete
optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an
efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of
the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through
comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we
demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed
in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token
logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private
information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This
suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate
protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at

Conclusion: PERTINENCE通过动态模型选择，有效平衡了计算效率和准确性，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable
ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer
vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often
more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and
energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on
such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high
computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of
challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,
carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based
way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to
analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most
suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To
achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an
ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the
solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers
(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's
ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in
terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By
opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE
achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

Result: 实验证明RelFCI能有效识别具有潜在混杂因素的关系因果模型中的正确因果结构。

Conclusion: RelFCI填补了关系数据因果发现的空白，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While
several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with
latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from
relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms
assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets.
To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery
algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms
and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in
relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for
relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental
results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct
causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯PINN是一种数学上更严谨的改进方法。

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often
suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of
information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined.
Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the
active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii)
vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from
the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the
computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and
consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments
show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a
set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with
combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

Conclusion: 需关注算法选择和新方向（如可微调方法和元学习），以提升学习率控制的效果。

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep
learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep
learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic
optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper
compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We
find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization,
fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform
very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.
This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate
control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning
communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches
becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when
combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A
focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable
methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly
strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经后验估计的模拟推理方法，用于高效估计1型糖尿病生理模型参数，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1型糖尿病的葡萄糖-胰岛素相互作用复杂，传统方法在高维参数空间中效率低且计算成本高。

Method: 采用基于神经后验估计的模拟推理方法，捕捉餐食、胰岛素和血糖水平的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在参数估计上优于传统方法，泛化能力更强，支持实时后验推断。

Conclusion: 该方法为1型糖尿病数字孪生提供了高效、可靠的参数估计解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新指标（Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage），用于更可靠、可解释地评估生成模型样本质量，解决了现有指标在鲁棒性和校准方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在关键应用中的使用受到样本质量评估不可靠的限制，现有指标缺乏校准或对异常值的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过剪裁单个样本贡献和最近邻球半径，提出Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage指标，防止异常样本影响整体评估。

Result: 新指标在合成和真实数据集上表现出更强的鲁棒性、敏感性和可解释性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage为生成模型样本质量评估提供了更可靠和直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years,
their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to
reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary
concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,
interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient
robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel
metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample
contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our
metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.
Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear
score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can
be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of
robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合神经网络的梯度优化能力与决策树的符号可解释性，提供紧凑且无需手动调优的模型。

Method: 将决策树的每个分支映射为隐藏神经元，构建稀疏神经网络，保留符号结构。

Result: 在多类分类任务中，BranchNet的准确率显著优于XGBoost。

Conclusion: BranchNet在符号可解释性和性能上表现优异，但在二元任务中可能需要进一步优化。

Abstract: We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms
decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each
branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped
to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based
optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no
manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class
classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in
accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture,
training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in
symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on
binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to knowledge transfer in model-based
reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large
world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently
distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact
model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving
performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a
state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M
parameter model score of 18.93. This improvement demonstrates the ability of
our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task
knowledge. We further optimize the distilled model through FP16 post-training
quantization, reducing its size by $\sim$50\%. Our approach addresses practical
deployment limitations and offers insights into knowledge representation in
large world models, paving the way for more efficient and accessible multi-task
reinforcement learning systems in robotics and other resource-constrained

Motivation: 探索GNN在解决SAT问题中的应用，结合MILP技术提升性能。

Method: 将k-CNF公式映射为MILP问题，编码为加权二分图，用GNN训练和测试。

Result: 理论证明稳定性和局限性，实验显示方法简单但效果良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现良好，为GNN解决SAT问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve
SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into
MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and
subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical
perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,
demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering
of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing
that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot
always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a
universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node
Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary
precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and
complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,
the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.
Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show
that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves
promising results.

TL;DR: mGRADE是一种混合内存系统，结合了1D卷积和最小门控循环单元，用于内存受限的边缘设备上的多尺度时间处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备需要能在严格内存限制下捕捉短长期动态的模型，现有方法如Transformers、RNNs和TCNs各有不足。

Method: 提出mGRADE，结合1D卷积和minGRU，卷积层捕捉快速变化，循环模块维护全局上下文。

Result: 在合成任务和图像分类基准测试中，mGRADE表现优于纯卷积和循环模型，内存占用减少20%。

Conclusion: mGRADE是内存受限边缘设备上高效多尺度时间处理的理想解决方案。

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short-
and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers
excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length
makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address
this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay
Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution
with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).
This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay
embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module
efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate
our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively
separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on
challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently
outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using
approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for
memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's
promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal
processing at the edge.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了基于预测不确定性和特征的OOD检测方法，指出这些方法存在根本性问题，无法有效识别OOD数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法依赖于监督模型的预测不确定性或特征，但这些方法无法从根本上解决OOD检测问题。

Method: 分析了基于不确定性和特征的OOD检测方法的局限性，并探讨了其他方法（如密度估计和生成模型）的不足。

Result: 发现这些方法在OOD检测中存在不可减少的错误，且常见干预措施无法解决目标不一致问题。

Conclusion: OOD检测需要新的方法，现有技术无法从根本上解决目标不一致的问题。

Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty
or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this
paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection
procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the
wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,
since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected
to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently
misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from
dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based
methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while
feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with
being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD
detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.
Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit
hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty
representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental
misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density
estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their
own fundamental limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SubLoRA是一种基于子模函数最大化的低秩适应（LoRA）秩确定方法，利用二阶信息（Hessian矩阵）改进现有线性化方法的不足，并通过贪心算法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如AdaLoRA）依赖损失函数的一阶近似，在LoRA参数优化良好时可能不准确且病态，因此需要更可靠且精细的二阶方法。

Method: 将秩确定问题重新表述为组合优化问题，引入子模函数最大化框架和贪心算法，并结合Hessian矩阵的闭式投影以保证计算效率。

Result: 在物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的微调实验中，SubLoRA在秩确定和联合训练性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SubLoRA结合了理论严谨性、二阶精度和计算效率，为LoRA秩确定提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

Conclusion: FAE为时间序列建模和异常检测提供了一种有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the
successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation
Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in
time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we
mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn
complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and
detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for
univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in
out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main
concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional
time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an
operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

Conclusion: 结合伪标签和混合深度学习在复杂、不平衡的异常检测场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including
fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection,
they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex
sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach
combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with
pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior
work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the
context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world
billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline
achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the
operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest
recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight
the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in
complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

Result: 发现当前法律框架无法解决AI生成内容带来的新问题，尤其是个人自主权和身份权利。

Conclusion: 需改进伦理和法律框架，以更好地适应AI技术发展中的同意问题。

Abstract: The evolution of generative AI systems exposes the challenges of traditional
legal and ethical frameworks built around consent. This chapter examines how
the conventional notion of consent, while fundamental to data protection and
privacy rights, proves insufficient in addressing the implications of
AI-generated content derived from personal data. Through legal and ethical
analysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of
their data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous
potential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is
used or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope
problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively
create what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding
ecosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these
emerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity
rights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated
content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the
original consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with
broader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency,
accountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and
legal approaches to consent.

Abstract: The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in
higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use
of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a
hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and
simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the
context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023
through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus
database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by
thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information,
i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic
modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a
representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by
Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and
thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.
  The simulation provided a composite "Success Score" forecasting the strength
of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements.
Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world
usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement
than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective
provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling,
resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools
within the university.

Abstract: As AI integrates in various types of human writing, calls for transparency
around AI assistance are growing. However, if transparency operates on uneven
ground and certain identity groups bear a heavier cost for being honest, then
the burden of openness becomes asymmetrical. This study investigates how AI
disclosure statement affects perceptions of writing quality, and whether these
effects vary by the author's race and gender. Through a large-scale controlled
experiment, both human raters (n = 1,970) and LLM raters (n = 2,520) evaluated
a single human-written news article while disclosure statements and author
demographics were systematically varied. This approach reflects how both human
and algorithmic decisions now influence access to opportunities (e.g., hiring,
promotion) and social recognition (e.g., content recommendation algorithms). We
find that both human and LLM raters consistently penalize disclosed AI use.
However, only LLM raters exhibit demographic interaction effects: they favor
articles attributed to women or Black authors when no disclosure is present.
But these advantages disappear when AI assistance is revealed. These findings
illuminate the complex relationships between AI disclosure and author identity,
highlighting disparities between machine and human evaluation patterns.

in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural
disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities
associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and
critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture
Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a
critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for
comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify
the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing
and monitoring critical transport infrastructures.

*Adam J. Eisen,Mitchell Ostrow,Sarthak Chandra,Leo Kozachkov,Earl K. Miller,Ila R. Fiete*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非线性控制理论框架JacobianODE，用于从数据中直接估计动态系统的雅可比矩阵，优于现有方法，并应用于多区域循环神经网络（RNN）的控制分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常为线性，难以描述非线性复杂系统的丰富上下文效应，因此需要一种数据驱动的非线性控制理论框架。

Method: 提出JacobianODE，一种深度学习方法，利用雅可比矩阵的性质直接从时间序列数据中估计动态系统的雅可比矩阵。

Result: JacobianODE在高维混沌等复杂系统中表现优于现有方法，并在多区域RNN中展示了学习过程中“感觉”区域对“认知”区域控制增强的现象。

Conclusion: 该工作为生物子系统间相互作用的理论驱动和数据驱动理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple
subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory
networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to
model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between
them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the
subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the
directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between
subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically
linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by
nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven
nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions
via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning
Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning
method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for
arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs
outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,
including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area
recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we
show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area
over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the
trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the
foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of
interactions among biological subsystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习（TL）的VLC室内定位方法，显著提升了定位精度、降低了能耗和计算时间，适用于工业4.0环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中精准室内定位需求迫切，VLC技术虽具潜力，但受环境变化影响较大，需解决其挑战。

Method: 采用迁移学习框架结合深度神经网络（DNN），利用真实工厂数据优化定位性能。

Result: 定位精度提升47%，能耗降低32%，计算时间减少40%，且仅需30%数据集即可达到类似精度。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、适应性强，适合工业4.0应用，具有成本效益和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible
Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high
accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However,
VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental
variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these
challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based
indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL
framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization
accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational
time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is
highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar
accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable
option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态通信中令牌表示的高效性和可靠性问题，同时应对自回归建模中的方差崩溃挑战。

Method: 提出GenIB原则优化令牌表示，开发σ-GenIB解决方差崩溃，并采用基于因果Transformer的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）统一处理离散和连续令牌。

Result: 仿真结果表明UniToCom在动态信道条件下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UniToCom通过结合令牌处理和MLLM，为下一代智能通信提供了可扩展和通用的多模态理解与生成解决方案。

Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that
treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless
transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we
propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which
facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while
supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this,
GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency
and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB
to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling,
maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a
causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver
to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the
next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic
channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom
enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal
understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for
next-generation intelligent communications.

Method: 实现并评估三种算法：直接贪婪启发式、超图近似和遗传算法，使用合成图数据集进行测试。

Result: 小图中算法表现符合理论界限；大图中解与理论界限差异显著。遗传算法在已知最优图上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 遗传算法和其他启发式方法在测试中表现最优，但大图中解的质量评估仍具挑战性。

Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical
analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper
addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms - a
direct greedy heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic
algorithm - on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with
analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results
demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set
sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved
solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the
absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless,
validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other
heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.

Abstract: Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its
clinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity,
distribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based
methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models,
providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance
model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This
systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt
engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including
textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze
their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and
classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve
task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency
and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater
model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite
substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in
prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for
clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future
trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical
integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating
the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.

Motivation: 当前多器官分割模型存在细节不准确、依赖几何提示和空间信息丢失的问题，需要改进。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，CRISP-SAM2优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2在解决多器官分割问题中表现出色，尤其在细节和空间信息处理上具有优势。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管分割在医学图像中对疾病诊断和手术导航至关重要，但现有方法常因血管细长和先验建模不足导致分割结果不连续。

Method: SWinMamba结合蛇形窗口序列（SWToken）和双向聚合模块（BAM），通过灵活的感受野和空间-频率融合单元（SFFU）增强血管连续性建模。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，SWinMamba能够生成完整且连通的血管分割结果，性能优越。

Conclusion: SWinMamba通过创新的蛇形窗口序列和双向建模，有效解决了血管分割中的不连续性问题，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vascular segmentation in medical images is crucial for disease diagnosis and
surgical navigation. However, the segmented vascular structure is often
discontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this
paper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve
accurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the
continuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window
sequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window
sequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global
visual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine
Window Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping
serpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for
vascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM)
integrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity
representation. In addition, dual-domain learning with Spatial-Frequency Fusion
Unit (SFFU) is designed to enhance the feature representation of vascular
structure. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that
the proposed SWinMamba achieves superior performance with complete and
connected vessels.

TL;DR: TANGERINE是一个开源、计算资源需求低的视觉基础模型，用于低剂量CT（LDCT）分析，可快速适应多种疾病检测任务，显著减少训练时间和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT在肺癌筛查中应用广泛，但放射科医生短缺限制了其大规模应用。TANGERINE旨在提供一个高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 基于自监督学习，TANGERINE使用超过98,000个胸部LDCT进行预训练，并通过微调适应多种疾病分类任务。

Result: 在14种疾病分类任务中表现优异，包括肺癌和多种呼吸系统疾病，且在不同临床中心具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TANGERINE的开源、轻量设计为快速整合到下一代医学影像工具奠定了基础，有望推动肺癌筛查向全面呼吸系统疾病管理的转变。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening
(LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a
generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related
early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of
radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a
computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT
analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can
be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with
limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained
from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,
thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label
efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of
fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000
thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public
datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease
classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,
while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a
masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable
solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive
models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest
computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays
the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools
that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular
focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management
in high-risk populations.

hypervolume metrics. Our tailored analysis reveals feature combinations that
influence algorithm performance specific to certain landscapes. This study
provides deeper insights into feature importance, tailored to specific

Conclusion: 该框架为超大规模高斯场景的训练和渲染提供了一种高效且无需分区的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view
synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of
small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on
partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at
chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly
suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with
street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU
memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce
A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale
Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our
method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a
Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the
relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with
Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a
lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to
support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable
seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex
scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅在无约束条件下表现优异，其协方差表示在长约束优化器中也能保持性能优势，适用于实际市场环境。

Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global
minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical
returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal
volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical
mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model
cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical
form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension,
so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and
applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump
that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the
future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real
daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the
estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum
drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors,
including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the
model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short)
minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation
can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no
loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains
persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation
framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage,
exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable
during episodes of acute market stress.

Abstract: Trauma prevalence is vast globally. Evidence-based digital treatments can
help, but most require human guidance. Human guides provide tailored
instructions and responsiveness to internal cognitive states, but limit
scalability. Can generative AI and neurotechnology provide a scalable
alternative? Here we test ANTIDOTE, combining AI guidance and pupillometry to
automatically deliver and monitor an evidence-based digital treatment,
specifically the Imagery Competing Task Intervention (ICTI), to reduce
intrusive memories after psychological trauma. One hundred healthy volunteers
were exposed to videos of traumatic events and randomly assigned to an
intervention or active control condition. As predicted, intervention
participants reported significantly fewer intrusive memories over the following
week. Post-hoc assessment against clinical rubrics confirmed the AI guide
delivered the intervention successfully. Additionally, pupil size tracked
intervention engagement and predicted symptom reduction, providing a candidate
biomarker of intervention effectiveness. These findings open a path toward
rigorous AI-guided digital interventions that can scale to trauma prevalence.

together with physical materials. Supported by human facilitation and a soft AI
presence, participants transformed lived experience into visual and tactile

of technical skills, behavioral focus, communication, and body language, posing
challenges such as subjectivity, difficulty in measuring key features, and
cognitive limitations. Addressing these issues, this study develops an
AI-driven framework to enhance maritime training by objectively assessing
trainee performance through visual focus tracking, speech recognition, and
stress detection, improving readiness for high-risk scenarios. The system
integrates AI techniques, including visual focus determination using eye
tracking, pupil dilation analysis, and computer vision; communication analysis
through a maritime-specific speech-to-text model and natural language
processing; communication correctness using large language models; and mental
stress detection via vocal pitch. Models were evaluated on data from simulated
maritime scenarios with seafarers exposed to controlled high-stress events. The
AI algorithms achieved high accuracy, with ~92% for visual detection, ~91% for
maritime speech recognition, and ~90% for stress detection, surpassing existing
benchmarks. The system provides insights into visual attention, adherence to
communication checklists, and stress levels under demanding conditions. This
study demonstrates how AI can transform maritime training by delivering
objective performance analytics, enabling personalized feedback, and improving
preparedness for real-world operational challenges.

### [170] [Towards culturally-appropriate conversational AI for health in the majority world: An exploratory study with citizens and professionals in Latin America](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01719)
*Dorian Peters,Fernanda Espinoza,Marco da Re,Guido Ivetta,Luciana Benotti,Rafael A. Calvo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在多元文化和语言背景下开发适用于全球多数地区的健康对话AI（CAI）的必要性，提出了一种基于拉丁美洲参与式研讨会的自下而上方法，并提出了一个“多元宇宙健康对话AI”框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）未能涵盖全球多样化的生活经验，尤其是在健康领域。为了确保CAI在文化和语言多样性中的有效性，需要补充现有自上而下的方法。

Method: 通过拉丁美洲的参与式研讨会收集定性数据，采用自下而上的本地化方法，分析文化错位、区域视角和文化适应性策略。

Result: 研究发现学术对文化的定义在地面层面失去意义，技术需融入更广泛的框架（如经济、政治、地理等）。提出了‘多元宇宙健康对话AI’框架。

Conclusion: 构建文化适应性CAI需要更多关系性和包容性，而不仅仅是数据量的增加。拉丁美洲的研究为全球多数地区提供了重要启示。

Abstract: There is justifiable interest in leveraging conversational AI (CAI) for
health across the majority world, but to be effective, CAI must respond
appropriately within culturally and linguistically diverse contexts. Therefore,
we need ways to address the fact that current LLMs exclude many lived
experiences globally. Various advances are underway which focus on top-down
approaches and increasing training data. In this paper, we aim to complement
these with a bottom-up locally-grounded approach based on qualitative data
collected during participatory workshops in Latin America. Our goal is to
construct a rich and human-centred understanding of: a) potential areas of
cultural misalignment in digital health; b) regional perspectives on chatbots
for health and c)strategies for creating culturally-appropriate CAI; with a
focus on the understudied Latin American context. Our findings show that
academic boundaries on notions of culture lose meaning at the ground level and
technologies will need to engage with a broader framework; one that
encapsulates the way economics, politics, geography and local logistics are
entangled in cultural experience. To this end, we introduce a framework for
'Pluriversal Conversational AI for Health' which allows for the possibility
that more relationality and tolerance, rather than just more data, may be
called for.

TL;DR: 论文提出在大型语言模型提示中显式建模GUI启发的提交和重置任务，以提升领域特定聊天机器人的交互清晰度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI通过明确的提交和重置操作管理用户意图，而聊天机器人依赖语言线索易导致混淆和上下文不完整。

Method: 将提交和重置任务建模为LLM提示中的显式任务，并捕获结构化会话数据（如用户确认和链式思考推理）。

Result: 在酒店预订和客户管理场景中，多轮任务连贯性、用户满意度和效率均得到提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模GUI启发任务可有效改善聊天机器人的交互清晰度和后端逻辑对齐。

Abstract: Domain specific chatbot applications often involve multi step interactions,
such as refining search filters, selecting multiple items, or performing
comparisons. Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these
workflows by providing explicit "Submit" (commit data) and "Reset" (discard
data) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously. In
contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which can lead to
confusion and incomplete context management. This paper proposes modeling these
GUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching
(reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By
capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT)
reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user
confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic.
We demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios,
highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种4D视频生成模型，通过跨视角点图对齐监督，实现多视角3D一致性，提升机器人对复杂环境的理解和预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强机器人在复杂环境中的规划和交互能力，解决现有视频生成模型在时间连贯性和几何一致性上的不足。

Method: 利用跨视角点图对齐监督训练模型，学习共享的3D场景表示，仅需RGB-D观测即可预测未来视频序列。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上生成更稳定、空间对齐的视频预测，并能恢复机器人末端执行器轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法支持机器人操作和新视角的泛化，为动态场景建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

Conclusion: DocShaDiffusion在文档图像阴影去除中表现出色，解决了彩色阴影问题，并通过合成数据集和模块设计提升了性能。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 解决无需重新训练即可对多种未见物体进行实例分割的难题。

Method: 利用Grounded-SAM 2生成物体提议和分割掩码，DINOv2生成图像嵌入，通过改进的匹配分数计算和过滤机制实现物体匹配。

Result: 在BOP 2023挑战的七个核心数据集上优于其他RGB和RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: NOCTIS框架在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了未见物体实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

Abstract: Insect pests continue to bring a serious threat to crop yields around the
world, and traditional methods for monitoring them are often slow, manual, and
difficult to scale. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful
solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision
transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest
detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between
2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected
research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset
usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs
but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that
deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges
like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited
generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles.
Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights
useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for
AI-based pest monitoring systems.

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

Motivation: 当前HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过度分割和类别不一致，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出P3HOT框架，结合语义驱动的提示机制和人类近端感知机制，引入RJLoss和AD-Acc.评估指标。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU和AD-Acc.分别提升0.7、2.0、1.6和11.0。

Conclusion: P3HOT在HOT检测任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

Motivation: 传统NeRF方法受限于内存，难以处理大规模场景。本文旨在提出一种高效的单设备解决方案。

Method: 采用分块策略，将场景划分为无重叠的3D块，并引入2×2块级联策略和分段采样器以避免边缘误差。

Result: 实验表明，Snake-NeRF能在单GPU上线性时间处理大规模卫星图像，且不损失重建质量。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF为大规模场景的3D重建提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在复杂开放世界环境中表现不佳，尤其是在光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真等挑战条件下。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以学习补丁级相对关系。

Result: 实验证明DepthAnything-AC在多样化基准测试中具有零样本能力，包括恶劣天气、合成失真和通用场景。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC在复杂环境条件下表现优异，为单目深度估计提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型注意力机制LASAD，用于解决线性注意力在图像生成中无法捕捉长距离依赖的问题，并基于此构建了LASADGen模型，实现了高效的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型依赖Transformer架构，计算复杂度和内存开销高，而线性注意力机制在图像生成中表现不佳，无法捕捉关键的长距离依赖。

Method: 提出LASAD机制，通过基于真实2D空间位置的衰减因子保留空间关系，并构建LASADGen模型，实现线性复杂度的选择性注意力。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，LASADGen在图像生成质量和计算效率上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的高效性和高质量图像生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Abstract: Landslides pose severe threats to infrastructure, economies, and human lives,
necessitating accurate detection and predictive mapping across diverse
geographic regions. With advancements in deep learning and remote sensing,
automated landslide detection has become increasingly effective. This study
presents a comprehensive approach integrating multi-source satellite imagery

leverage Sentinel-2 multispectral data and ALOS PALSAR-derived slope and
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layers to capture critical environmental features
influencing landslide occurrences. Various geospatial analysis techniques are
employed to assess the impact of terra in characteristics, vegetation cover,
and rainfall on detection accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of multiple stateof-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including U-Net,
DeepLabV3+, and Res-Net, to determine their effectiveness in landslide
detection. The proposed framework contributes to the development of reliable
early warning systems, improved disaster risk management, and sustainable
land-use planning. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential of
deep learning and multi-source remote sensing in creating robust, scalable, and

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过将任务重新定义为铬球修复问题，从单张低动态范围图像估计光照的简单有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限的HDR全景数据集，泛化能力不足，因此需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的扩散模型Stable Diffusion XL进行铬球修复，并通过迭代修复生成稳定的低频光照先验，结合Exposure LoRA生成HDR光探针。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多样化场景中生成逼真的光照估计，并展现出对野外场景的优越泛化能力。

Conclusion: DiffusionLight及其加速版本DiffusionLight-Turbo提供了一种高效且通用的光照估计解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模难以适应新偏好，需要大量数据和单独模型，因此需要更灵活高效的少样本方法。

Method: 利用激活导向（activation steering）构建奖励信号，无需额外微调，仅需少量监督。

Result: Activation RMs在标准奖励建模基准上优于现有少样本方法，并在新提出的PreferenceHack基准上表现最佳，甚至超过GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Activation RMs是一种高效、灵活的少样本奖励建模方法，适用于安全关键应用，并展示了在奖励建模领域的领先性能。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

Result: 主动测量在多个测量任务中降低了估计误差，且能在AI模型不完美时仍提供精确估计。

Conclusion: 主动测量框架显著提升了科学测量的效率和可靠性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度方向一致性的OOD检测方法，通过短路异常梯度提升OOD检测性能，同时保持ID分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中部署深度学习模型时，OOD检测至关重要。研究发现，ID样本的梯度方向一致，而OOD样本的梯度方向混乱，这启发了通过梯度短路提升OOD检测的方法。

Method: 提出了一种推理阶段的技术，通过短路异常梯度来降低OOD样本的置信度，同时引入局部一阶近似以避免二次前向传播的计算开销。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，且方法轻量，对标准推理流程改动小。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 ViTs 在医学影像任务中的语义表示是否具有实际意义，以及其对微小变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析 ViTs 的表示。

Result: ViTs 的表示缺乏语义意义，对微小变化敏感，分类准确率可下降超过 60%。

Conclusion: ViTs 在医学影像分类中的语义表示存在根本性问题，可能影响其在安全关键系统中的部署。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP通过创新设计，为息肉分割领域设定了新标准，解决了弱边界和泛化问题。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，尤其是几何任务和提示敏感性方面。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成因内存限制导致高延迟，现有方法并行化效果有限。

Method: 提出灵活并行自回归建模和局部感知生成顺序两种技术。

Result: 在ImageNet上，生成步骤从256降至20（256×256分辨率），延迟降低至少3.4倍。

Conclusion: LPD在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了并行化和效率。

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，阻碍了模型在稀疏场景中的潜力。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，通过连续放置标记和基于oracle的搜索优化位置。

Result: SPoT显著减少了推理所需的标记数量，同时提升了性能。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效和可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法多限于标量方程，难以识别张量关系，因此需要一种通用框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用宿主-质粒结构表示张量方程，结合遗传信息保留策略、维度一致性检查和张量线性回归技术。

Result: 在基准测试中准确恢复目标方程，对噪声和小样本具有鲁棒性，并成功从分子模拟数据中识别本构关系。

Conclusion: SITE为数据驱动的张量方程发现提供了有效工具，适用于多种流场条件。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven methods have shown great promise for discovering
governing equations from simulation or experimental data. However, most
existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of
identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general
data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic
Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing
tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the
multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the
robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information
retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond
conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional
homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid
expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor
linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical
coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where
it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness
to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify
constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are
generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to
both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully
identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for
data-driven discovery of tensor equation.

### [199] [Automated Vehicles Should be Connected with Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01059)
*Xiangbo Gao,Keshu Wu,Hao Zhang,Kexin Tian,Yang Zhou,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出通过自然语言实现多智能体协作驾驶中的意图与推理通信，以解决现有通信媒介的带宽效率、信息完整性和互操作性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作驾驶通信媒介（如传感器数据、神经网络特征等）在带宽效率、信息完整性和智能体互操作性方面存在局限，且缺乏决策级融合。

Method: 采用自然语言作为通信媒介，直接传递意图、推理和决策，实现从感知数据共享到主动协调的转变。

Result: 自然语言通信提升了协作驾驶的安全性、效率和透明度。

Conclusion: 自然语言通信为智能交通系统中的多智能体协作驾驶提供了更高效、灵活和透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and
efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing
communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and
perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information
completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have
largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of
collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges
requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to
explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural
language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly
to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling
the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it
transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into
proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in
intelligent transportation systems.

### [200] [RALLY: Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked Navigation for Agentic UAV Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01378)
*Ziyao Wang,Rongpeng Li,Sizhao Li,Yuming Xiang,Haiping Wang,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RALLY的角色自适应LLM驱动导航算法，通过结合LLM的语义推理和MARL的在线学习，解决了无人机群智能控制中的语义沟通和角色僵化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MARL方法在无人机群控制中存在语义沟通障碍和角色同质化问题，而现有LLM框架缺乏在线学习能力，导致探索效率低。

Method: RALLY结合了LLM驱动的语义决策框架、动态角色异构机制和基于RMIX的角色分配策略，实现半离线训练。

Result: 实验表明，RALLY在任务覆盖率、收敛速度和泛化能力上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RALLY在无人机群协作导航中展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as
a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate
effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over
multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the
semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role
structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability.
Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks
demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive
prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance
on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration,
leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To
address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked
navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven
semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient
semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a
dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and
personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing
Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors
with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection
strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)
environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY
outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence
speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative
navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中信息共享不足和动态问题解决的挑战。

Method: 提出黑板架构，支持信息共享和动态代理选择，通过迭代执行达成共识。

Result: 在常识、推理和数学数据集上表现优于现有静态和动态多智能体系统，且消耗更少token。

Conclusion: 黑板架构有望支持复杂动态问题解决，尤其是在缺乏明确结构或流程的场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to incorporate the blackboard architecture into LLM
multi-agent systems (MASs) so that (1) agents with various roles can share all
the information and others' messages during the whole problem-solving process,
(2) agents that will take actions are selected based on the current content of
the blackboard, and (3) the selection and execution round is repeated until a
consensus is reached on the blackboard. We develop the first implementation of
this proposal and conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge, reasoning and
mathematical datasets. The results show that our system can be competitive with
the SOTA static and dynamic MASs by achieving the best average performance, and
at the same time manage to spend less tokens. Our proposal has the potential to
enable complex and dynamic problem-solving where well-defined structures or
workflows are unavailable.

TL;DR: 论文提出‘Data Agent’概念，利用大语言模型（LLMs）增强数据系统的语义理解、推理和规划能力，以优化Data+AI应用的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Data+AI系统依赖人工专家协调系统流程，难以适应数据、查询、任务和环境的变化，亟需结合LLMs技术提升系统能力。

Method: 提出‘Data Agent’架构，整合知识理解、推理和规划能力，解决数据任务协调问题，并探讨设计中的挑战。

Result: 展示了多种数据代理系统实例，如数据科学代理、数据分析代理和DBA代理，并指出设计中的开放挑战。

Conclusion: Data Agent结合LLMs技术有望革新数据系统，但仍需解决设计中的开放挑战。

Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize
performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system
pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and
environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools
available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools
remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems
have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning.
Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in
enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is
crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for
orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive
architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on
tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning,
and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing
data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools,
orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and
fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data
agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as
unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent,
data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a
database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges
associated with designing data agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战关于机器系统能维持经济和认知秩序的假设，探讨AI在经济协调和伦理框架中的根本缺陷。

Method: 结合米塞斯先验推理和奥地利企业家理论，分析AI在经济协调（如目标解释、手段发现、主观价值传递）中的无能。

Result: AI系统无法生成规范、解释制度或承担责任，且主流伦理框架（如FAT）与自由主义秩序冲突。

Conclusion: AI争论关乎人类自主权和制度演化的未来，奥地利学派提供了对抗计算社会控制的唯一连贯替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and
algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine
systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori
reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems
are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination:
interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value
through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as
optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under
uncertainty.
  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability,
and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which
conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights.
Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of
ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms,
interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned,
and inert.
  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance
degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft
totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over
AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned
choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and
spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational
social control.

Abstract: We propose an open-source framework for Command-style dictation that
addresses the gap between resource-intensive Online systems and high-latency
Batch processing. Our approach uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to segment
audio and transcribes these segments in parallel using Whisper models, enabling
efficient multiplexing across audios. Unlike proprietary systems like
SuperWhisper, this framework is also compatible with most ASR architectures,
including widely used CTC-based models. Our multiplexing technique maximizes
compute utilization in real-world settings, as demonstrated by its deployment
in around 15% of India's courtrooms. Evaluations on live data show consistent
latency reduction as user concurrency increases, compared to sequential batch
processing. The live demonstration will showcase our open-sourced

Motivation: 研究旨在了解MGS在音乐制作中的实际应用潜力，以及如何将其作为协作工具融入创作流程。

Method: 采用单评估者方法，结合定性和定量分析，评估不同架构的MGS在作曲、编曲和声音设计中的表现。

Result: 研究发现MGS主要作为辅助工具，无法完全替代人类创造力，尤其在情感深度和复杂决策方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个结构化评价框架，为未来MGS的开发和集成提供了实证基础。

Abstract: This study presents an exploratory evaluation of Music Generation Systems
(MGS) within contemporary music production workflows by examining eight
open-source systems. The evaluation framework combines technical insights with
practical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate
the practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative,
non-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology
as a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing
qualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through
quantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity
across both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning
composition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses
limitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities
for workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools
while maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function
primarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human
expertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural
coherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks
demanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a
structured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music
creation. It identifies methodological refinements necessary for subsequent
comprehensive evaluations and determines viable areas for AI integration as
collaborative tools in creative workflows. The research provides
empirically-grounded insights to guide future development in the field.

Motivation: 解决传统全局KL或PL条件过于严格的问题，适应更广泛的实践场景，同时应对局部KL条件带来的新挑战。

Method: 提出一种不精确近端梯度方法，通过近端梯度法计算极大函数的不精确梯度，解决KL结构子问题。

Result: 证明了极大函数的局部Hölder光滑性，并在温和假设下给出了计算近似稳定点的复杂度保证。

Conclusion: 局部KL条件更灵活，但需解决其带来的复杂性；提出的方法有效且具有理论保证。

Abstract: We study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner
maximization problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition
that may vary with the outer minimization variable. In contrast to the global
KL or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature
-- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice --
this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios.
However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an
optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the
region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more
intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge,
we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\"older smooth.
Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method
for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal
function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured
subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for
computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.

Motivation: 随着LLM代理在社会经济互动中的应用增加，识别其潜在不良行为（如串通）变得至关重要。

Method: 通过模拟连续双重拍卖市场，研究LLM代理作为卖家的行为，分析沟通、模型选择和环境压力对串通行为的影响。

Result: 直接沟通增加串通倾向，不同模型的串通倾向不同，环境压力（如监管和紧迫感）影响串通行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调了部署基于LLM的市场代理时需考虑的经济和伦理问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
autonomous agents with rapidly expanding applications in various domains. As
these agents increasingly engage in socioeconomic interactions, identifying
their potential for undesirable behavior becomes essential. In this work, we
examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive
cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we
investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated
continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments,
we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model,
and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of
seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive
tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental
pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence
collusive behavior. Our findings highlight important economic and ethical
considerations for the deployment of LLM-based market agents.

Abstract: Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems
remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and
electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of
next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is
proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic
properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic
moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike
previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds,
the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable,
binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the
Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and
advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix
sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic
ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes,
addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic
moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's
matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately
estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic
behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient
framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic
materials with tailored properties.

Abstract: In the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, we are given a set $X$ of
data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a kernel function $k: \mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and a query point $\mathbf{q} \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and the objective is to quickly output an estimate of
$\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in X} k(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{x})$. In this paper, we consider
$\textsf{KDE}$ in the dynamic setting, and introduce a data structure that
efficiently maintains the estimates for a set of query points as data points
are added to $X$ over time. Based on this, we design a dynamic data structure
that maintains a sparse approximation of the fully connected similarity graph
on $X$, and develop a fast dynamic spectral clustering algorithm. We further
evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流星群的准确识别对理解其起源和演化至关重要，但重叠簇和背景噪声增加了分类难度，特别是对依赖流星雨观测的任务（如ESA的LUMIO）。

Method: 使用HDBSCAN算法分析CAMS流星轨道数据库，比较三种特征向量（LUTAB、ORBIT、GEO），并通过匈牙利算法与CAMS分类对齐，评估聚类性能。

Result: HDBSCAN确认了39个流星群（GEO向量），其中21个与CAMS高度一致；ORBIT向量识别了30个流星群，13个匹配度高。eom方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: HDBSCAN在统计一致性上优于传统方法，但需进一步验证其物理有效性，展示了其作为流星群识别替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding
their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise
hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that
rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters.
This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised
meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established
Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze
the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS
geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted
geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes
and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters
with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal
mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score,
Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis
further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39
meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies
30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose
identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior
performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful
selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally
consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical
coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically
consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further
validation is needed to assess physical validity.

explore the scenarios of coupling HPC and AI (HPC-AI) in the context of
emerging scientific applications, presenting a novel methodology that
incorporates three patterns of coupling: surrogate, directive, and coordinate.
Each pattern exemplifies a distinct coupling strategy, AI-driven prerequisite,

demonstrate the application and effectiveness of these patterns. The study
highlights technical challenges, performance improvements, and implementation
details, providing insight into promising perspectives of HPC-AI coupling. The

also to other scientific domains, offering valuable guidance for future HPC-AI

grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping
methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough
transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling
complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale
microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach
for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated
generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the
analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning
architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional
Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated,
using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM
algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin
Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer
achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural
predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary
delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring
the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based
image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine
learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural
characterization.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高斯混合模型（GMM）家族，通过分段常数协方差特征值配置，平衡了全协方差和球形协方差的灵活性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全协方差GMM在高维空间中过参数化，而球形GMM缺乏拟合各向异性分布的能力。

Method: 引入分段常数协方差特征值配置的GMM，支持任意特征值多重性序列，并提出了基于EM算法的参数学习方法。

Result: 新模型在密度拟合、聚类和单图像去噪等无监督任务中表现出优越的似然性与简洁性权衡。

Conclusion: 该模型扩展了低秩模型（如MPPCA），并通过惩罚EM算法解决了参数与超参数联合学习的挑战。

Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are ubiquitous in statistical learning,
particularly for unsupervised problems. While full GMMs suffer from the
overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces,
spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility
to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we
introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance
eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated
mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling
any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are
prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the
notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and
hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose
monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs
achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density
fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.

Conclusion: 二元化序数数据可显著提升排名恢复准确性，特定模式函数能最大化二元化效益，实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central
role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data
intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper
challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework
for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a
generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the
preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the
distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical
binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as
binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that
binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking
recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking
error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential
convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a
substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the
pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of
binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens
dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Grey matter loss in the hippocampus is a hallmark of neurobiological aging,
yet understanding the corresponding changes in its functional connectivity
remains limited. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables
voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical
regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this
study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age
from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D
CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key
hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus,
posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal
lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age.
Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals
distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These
findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal
aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover
biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.

Abstract: Smart homes that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices face increasing
cybersecurity risks, posing significant challenges to these environments. The
study explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them
into vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from
cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum
encryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in
enhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant
challenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures
builds security resilience, although they need changes to existing
infrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness
through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack
sufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the
requirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced
threat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）易受越狱攻击，需要系统化评估其安全机制的漏洞。

Method: 利用参数化攻击者LLM生成语义伪装恶意提示，采用多轮攻击方法，结合角色扮演、误导和上下文操纵等技术。

Result: 在ChatGPT、Llama和DeepSeek等模型上，攻击成功率达到86%。

Conclusion: 当前安全机制对多轮攻击仍脆弱，亟需更强大的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities to
jailbreaking attacks: carefully crafted malicious inputs intended to circumvent
safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. As such, we present AutoAdv, a
novel framework that automates adversarial prompt generation to systematically
evaluate and expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms. Our approach
leverages a parametric attacker LLM to produce semantically disguised malicious
prompts through strategic rewriting techniques, specialized system prompts, and
optimized hyperparameter configurations. The primary contribution of our work
is a dynamic, multi-turn attack methodology that analyzes failed jailbreak
attempts and iteratively generates refined follow-up prompts, leveraging
techniques such as roleplaying, misdirection, and contextual manipulation. We
quantitatively evaluate attack success rate (ASR) using the StrongREJECT
(arXiv:2402.10260 [cs.CL]) framework across sequential interaction turns.
Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models--including
ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek--we reveal significant vulnerabilities, with our
automated attacks achieving jailbreak success rates of up to 86% for harmful
content generation. Our findings reveal that current safety mechanisms remain
susceptible to sophisticated multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the urgent need
for more robust defense strategies.

Motivation: 中小型制造商因竞争和隐私问题不愿共享专有数据，但需要创新工具解决实际问题。

Result: 成功开发并部署了食品晶体图像分析工具，显著提高了效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 隐私保护平台有效解决了数据共享问题，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because
of competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their
proprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This
paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may
safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those
researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world
problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform
for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate
this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem
in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality
control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals
in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and
time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal
analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool
enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers
from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample
preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high
resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also
developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged
for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the
originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while
keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process,
future directions are also explored.

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，强调实际应用中的协议选择和优化。

Abstract: Ishai et al. (FOCS'06) introduced secure shuffling as an efficient building
block for private data aggregation. Recently, the field of differential privacy
has revived interest in secure shufflers by highlighting the privacy
amplification they can provide in various computations. Although several works
argue for the utility of secure shufflers, they often treat them as black
boxes; overlooking the practical vulnerabilities and performance trade-offs of
existing implementations. This leaves a central question open: what makes a
good secure shuffler?
  This survey addresses that question by identifying, categorizing, and
comparing 26 secure protocols that realize the necessary shuffling
functionality. To enable a meaningful comparison, we adapt and unify existing
security definitions into a consistent set of properties. We also present an
overview of privacy-preserving technologies that rely on secure shufflers,
offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate protocols, and outline
promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 自动化在SOC中至关重要，但需解决数据不平衡和解释性问题。

Method: 使用DeepCASE评估标签不平衡对警报分类的影响。

Result: 标签不平衡影响分类性能和解释性。

Conclusion: 调整SOC检测规则可减少不平衡，提升自动化的性能和解释性。

Abstract: Automation in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) plays a prominent role in
alert classification and incident escalation. However, automated methods must
be robust in the presence of imbalanced input data, which can negatively affect
performance. Additionally, automated methods should make explainable decisions.
In this work, we evaluate the effect of label imbalance on the classification
of network intrusion alerts. As our use-case we employ DeepCASE, the
state-of-the-art method for automated alert classification. We show that label
imbalance impacts both classification performance and correctness of the
classification explanations offered by DeepCASE. We conclude tuning the
detection rules used in SOCs can significantly reduce imbalance and may benefit
the performance and explainability offered by alert post-processing methods
such as DeepCASE. Therefore, our findings suggest that traditional methods to
improve the quality of input data can benefit automation.

Conclusion: 自适应运动基元显著提升规划效率，适用于复杂和高自由度场景。

Abstract: This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that
combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core
contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free
configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph
search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space,
burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to
fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid
path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within
the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated
through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying
number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results
demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in
complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving
comparable performance in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for
evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code
generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA
simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based
control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical
dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates
safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of
traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge
the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video
generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts
rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables
controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but
critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden
vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical
scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous
vehicles.

enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities.
In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model,
which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end
system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom
question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning

Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the
potential to transform biological research by enabling autonomous
experimentation. Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol
design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error
handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS
(Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that
integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and
execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the
Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the
Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the
Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and
anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture
tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and
morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization,
outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment
epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration,
while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware.
These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory
automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in
biological research.

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory
perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery
noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate
robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While
existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address
general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or
the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by
offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep
learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and
subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks

networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and
training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored.
Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to

Conclusion: JumpER为极端欠驱动和极端地形下的运动任务提供了一种原则性和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in enabling quadruped
robots to perform agile locomotion. However, directly training policies to
simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due
to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address
this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving
priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple
stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors
through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER
progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration
and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or
handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured
three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation
space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust
monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the
resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional
methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly
spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.
JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing
locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains.

Conclusion: AC-DiT显著提升了移动操作中的协调性和适应性。

Abstract: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling
language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing
methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,
primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly
model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily
leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual
observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct
multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile
manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion
Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination
for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base
directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body
conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion
representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body
actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact
of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at
different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware
multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights
between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features
tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for
example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial
for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric
information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks generate and process large volumes of data, posing
challenges for low-resource embedded systems. In-memory computing has been
demonstrated as an efficient computing infrastructure and shows promise for
embedded AI applications. Among newly-researched memory technologies, racetrack
memory is a non-volatile technology that allows high data density fabrication,
making it a good fit for in-memory computing. However, integrating in-memory
arithmetic circuits with memory cells affects both the memory density and power
efficiency. It remains challenging to build efficient in-memory arithmetic
circuits on racetrack memory within area and energy constraints. To this end,
we present an efficient in-memory convolutional neural network (CNN)
accelerator optimized for use with racetrack memory. We design a series of
fundamental arithmetic circuits as in-memory computing cells suited for
multiply-and-accumulate operations. Moreover, we explore the design space of
racetrack memory based systems and CNN model architectures, employing co-design
to improve the efficiency and performance of performing CNN inference in
racetrack memory while maintaining model accuracy. Our designed circuits and
model-system co-optimization strategies achieve a small memory bank area with
significant improvements in energy and performance for racetrack memory based
embedded systems.

Motivation: 重新理解不可计算性，将其从局部问题扩展到系统层面，揭示其在自然和人工系统中的普遍约束。

Method: 定义因果嵌入概念，证明闭包原则，将经典结果推广到动态系统背景。

Result: 不可判定性是预测、建模和认知访问的普遍约束，挑战通过架构创新绕过计算限制的观点。

Conclusion: 工作扩展了哥德尔、图灵和柴廷的逻辑轨迹，为可计算性拓扑及其与科学知识边界的关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a theory of systemic undecidability, reframing
incomputability as a structural property of systems rather than a localized
feature of specific functions or problems. We define a notion of causal
embedding and prove a closure principle: any subsystem that participates
functionally in the computation of an undecidable system inherits its
undecidability. This result positions undecidability as a pervasive constraint
on prediction, modeling, and epistemic access in both natural and artificial
systems. Our framework disarms oracle mimicry and challenges the view that
computational limits can be circumvented through architectural innovation. By
generalizing classical results into a dynamic systems context, this work
augments the logical trajectory of G\"odel, Turing, and Chaitin, offering a new
perspective of the topology of computability and its interrelation to the
boundaries of scientific knowledge.

Motivation: 受大语言模型成功的启发，将类似方法扩展到恒星光谱分析，以学习鲁棒且信息丰富的嵌入，支持多样化的下游应用。

Method: SpecCLIP在LAMOST低分辨率和Gaia XP光谱数据集上预训练，采用CLIP框架进行对比对齐，并结合辅助解码器保留光谱特定信息。

Conclusion: 对比训练的基础模型结合光谱感知解码器，可以推动精密恒星光谱学的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.
Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework
that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar
spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical
information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral
datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support
diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves
pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed
by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different
instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve
spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between
spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information
between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework
enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We
demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets
improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and
chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and
precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.
Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities
offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively
trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance
precision stellar spectroscopy.

Method: 提出GuideSep，结合波形模仿条件和频谱掩码，利用扩散模型实现乐器无关分离。

Result: GuideSep在客观和主观评估中表现优异，支持更灵活的乐器提取。

Conclusion: 扩散生成方法结合用户参与，为音乐源分离提供了更高灵活性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract individual instrument sources
from their mixture. While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted
four-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this
approach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications. To address
this, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of
instrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is
conditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be
easily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram
domain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior
approaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning
scheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and
applicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the
same model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative
approaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep
achieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument
extraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the
diffusion-based generative process for MSS. Our code and demo page are

Abstract: We present a full-stack emergency vehicle (EV) siren detection system
designed for real-time deployment on embedded hardware. The proposed approach
is based on E2PANNs, a fine-tuned convolutional neural network derived from
EPANNs, and optimized for binary sound event detection under urban acoustic
conditions. A key contribution is the creation of curated and semantically
structured datasets - AudioSet-EV, AudioSet-EV Augmented, and Unified-EV -
developed using a custom AudioSet-Tools framework to overcome the low
reliability of standard AudioSet annotations. The system is deployed on a
Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a high-fidelity DAC+microphone board, implementing
a multithreaded inference engine with adaptive frame sizing, probability
smoothing, and a decision-state machine to control false positive activations.
A remote WebSocket interface provides real-time monitoring and facilitates live
demonstration capabilities. Performance is evaluated using both framewise and
event-based metrics across multiple configurations. Results show the system
achieves low-latency detection with improved robustness under realistic audio
conditions. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying IoS-compatible
SED solutions that can form distributed acoustic monitoring networks, enabling
collaborative emergency vehicle tracking across smart city infrastructures
through WebSocket connectivity on low-cost edge devices.

Motivation: 古典音乐的创作不仅依赖于作曲家，还依赖于表演者对静态乐谱的诠释。本文旨在模拟这一双重角色，生成具有表现力的古典钢琴表演。

Method: 引入ECP表示捕捉表演的韵律结构和表现细节，提出XMVAE模型，包含VQ-VAE分支（作曲家）和VAE分支（钢琴家），采用多尺度编码器和正交Transformer解码器。

Result: XMVAE在客观和主观评估中均优于现有模型，生成更高质量的古典表演。预训练作曲家分支可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: XMVAE成功模拟了作曲家和钢琴家的双重角色，为古典音乐生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: The creativity of classical music arises not only from composers who craft
the musical sheets but also from performers who interpret the static notations
with expressive nuances. This paper addresses the challenge of generating
classical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of
composer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive
Compound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the
metrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building
on this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a
model featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the
Composer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling
the role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq
architectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual
information and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens
decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE
generates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to
state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, pretraining the Composer branch on extra
musical score datasets contribute to a significant performance gain.

Motivation: 传统火山地震分类方法依赖主观人为判断，耗时耗力，需要更高效、客观的解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种基于Transformer编码器的深度学习模型，并通过注意权重可视化增强可解释性。

Result: 模型在Mount Asama的多样地震活动中表现出色（F1分数高），且注意权重与人类专家关注的特征一致。

Conclusion: Transformer模型为火山地震分类提供了高效、可解释的框架，并可通过迁移学习应用于其他火山区域，提升灾害评估能力。

Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the
relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However,
traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires
considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep
learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient
classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model
achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency
earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method.
To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed,
revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human
experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled
B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and
attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and
augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and
diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important
role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings
highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic
earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and
interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and
subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding
seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities
for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced
volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.

Result: 成功在合理时间内找到10个高维（最高10,000维）多模态测试函数的全局最小值，远超文献报道结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证结果准确性的同时显著提高了计算效率，适用于大规模非线性函数的全局优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the
global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the
variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and
architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search
domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions
where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of
interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of
the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency,
the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel
programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a
variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce
computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method
is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable
dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy
function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent
grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global
minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not
been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible
domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10
benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a
reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the
literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU
architecture.

Conclusion: 通过自适应增加网络容量和数据量，稀疏网格求积在高维数值积分中具有一致性。

Abstract: This paper provides a proof of the consistency of sparse grid quadrature for
numerical integration of high dimensional distributions. In a first step, a
transport map is learned that normalizes the distribution to a noise
distribution on the unit cube. This step is built on the statistical learning
theory of neural ordinary differential equations, which has been established
recently. Secondly, the composition of the generative map with the quantity of
interest is integrated numerically using the Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid
quadrature. A decomposition of the total numerical error in quadrature error
and statistical error is provided. As main result it is proven in the framework
of empirical risk minimization that all error terms can be controlled in the
sense of PAC (probably approximately correct) learning and with high
probability the numerical integral approximates the theoretical value up to an
arbitrary small error in the limit where the data set size is growing and the
network capacity is increased adaptively.

Conclusion: NESCFN方法在无需未来时间解信息的情况下，实现了物理一致性和稳定性。

Abstract: We propose a neural entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network
(NESCFN) for learning hyperbolic conservation laws and their associated entropy
functions directly from solution trajectories, without requiring any predefined
numerical discretization. While recent neural network architectures have
successfully integrated classical numerical principles into learned models,
most rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations or assume a fixed
discretization. Our approach removes this dependency by embedding
entropy-stable design principles into the learning process itself, enabling the
discovery of physically consistent dynamics in a fully data-driven setting. By
jointly learning both the numerical flux function and a corresponding entropy,
the proposed method ensures conservation and entropy dissipation, critical for
long-term stability and fidelity in the system of hyperbolic conservation laws.
Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves stability and
conservation over extended time horizons and accurately captures shock
propagation speeds, even without oracle access to future-time solution profiles
in the training data.

Conclusion: 提出的AI原生解码器具有灵活性、可扩展性和高性能，为6G网络的信道编码提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of
requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands
challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and
scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we
propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding
based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention
message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked
cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input
representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to
effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved
state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on
this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture
invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to
decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding
performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT
ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel
CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture
can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across
diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder
offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising
direction to channel coding for 6G networks.

Abstract: Deep Recommender Models (DLRMs) inference is a fundamental AI workload
accounting for more than 79% of the total AI workload in Meta's data centers.
DLRMs' performance bottleneck is found in the embedding layers, which perform
many random memory accesses to retrieve small embedding vectors from tables of
various sizes. We propose the design of tailored data flows to speedup
embedding look-ups. Namely, we propose four strategies to look up an embedding
table effectively on one core, and a framework to automatically map the tables
asymmetrically to the multiple cores of a SoC. We assess the effectiveness of
our method using the Huawei Ascend AI accelerators, comparing it with the
default Ascend compiler, and we perform high-level comparisons with Nvidia
A100. Results show a speed-up varying from 1.5x up to 6.5x for real workload
distributions, and more than 20x for extremely unbalanced distributions.
Furthermore, the method proves to be much more independent of the query
distribution than the baseline.

Abstract: Organizations around the world schedule jobs (programs) regularly to perform
various tasks dictated by their end users. With the major movement towards
using a cloud computing infrastructure, our organization follows a hybrid
approach with both cloud and on-prem servers. The objective of this work is to
perform capacity planning, i.e., estimate resource requirements, and job
scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our
approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the
jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market
conditions significantly influence job characteristics. For capacity planning
and scheduling, we simultaneously balance two conflicting objectives: (a)
minimize resource usage, and (b) provide high quality-of-service to the end
users by completing jobs by their requested deadlines. We propose approximate
approaches using deterministic estimators and pair sampling-based constraint
programming. Our best approach (pair sampling-based) achieves much lower peak
resource usage compared to manual scheduling without compromising on the
quality-of-service.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their
versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with
parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these
models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.
Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial
benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized
responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge
devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter
selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter
swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,
processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational
resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient
system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA
incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism
to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory
management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate
memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient
batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive
evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly
outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and
throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times
boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of
magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's
potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,
offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: The Alps Research Infrastructure leverages GH200 technology at scale,
featuring 10,752 GPUs. Accessing Alps provides a significant computational
advantage for researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML). While Alps serves a broad range of scientific communities, traditional
HPC services alone are not sufficient to meet the dynamic needs of the ML
community. This paper presents an initial investigation into extending HPC
service capabilities to better support ML workloads. We identify key challenges
and gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the
Swiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These
include a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML
workloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid
performance screening of ML applications during development; observability
capabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads;
a utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a
service plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including
support and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the
specific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the
execution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and
resilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also
discuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by
placing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities
served by HPC infrastructure like ours.
