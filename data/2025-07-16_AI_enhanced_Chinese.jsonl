Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives.

As in previous\nyears, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of\nhuman annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking\ntasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and\ndocument collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$\ntimes increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times\nincrease in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we\nmainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage\nretrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document\nranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were\ninferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to\nprevious years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining\ncontinued to outperform traditional retrieval methods.

However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5174\u8da3\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u800cLLM\u867d\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5174\u8da3\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u914d\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\uff1b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u8026\u4e0d\u540c\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u591a\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem.

Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical\napplications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing\nimputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the\nvarying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to\nunreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph\nCompletion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known\nneighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to\niteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering\ninformation to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware\nFeature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting\npropagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,\nHierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing\nnodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood\nattributes.

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction.

However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones.

However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance.

We present\nGoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized\nAI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold\ninto a blockchain based stablecoin (\"OZ\"). Our approach combines on chain smart\ncontracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision\nmaking, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the\nflexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents\n(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a\ncoordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled\npilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token\nissuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The\nMarket Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5\npercent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:\nan oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a\nsimulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user\nimpact.

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt.

In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of\nradical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a\ngroup theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining\ncharacteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder,\nwhen a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our\nanalysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and\nwe introduce quantitative measures to characterize these.

Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the\ndecision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor\nsimulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view\ncamera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in\nnavigation accuracy and adaptability.

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u5f00\u653e\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8d77\u6e90\u751f\u547d\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u867d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6e90\u751f\u547d\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal\nsignificantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control\nconditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between\nparticipant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,\nsuggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy.

These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component\neffectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in\nrecurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated\nthrough results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport\nexamples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum\nrelative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to\nprevious surrogate model approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff08GALDS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6811\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u8fd0\u8f93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6811\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7269\u8d28\u8fd0\u8f93\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "GALDS\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u79cd\u672a\u89c1\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c4\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u8fd0\u8f93\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cGALDS\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a3%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee<8%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GALDS\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u8d28\u8fd0\u8f93\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning\nthe dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often\nrelying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a\nclass-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows\nremarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and\nrecall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets.

Second, we identify\nand experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across\ntimesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias\nand inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we\nobserve that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept\nregions within training data, corrupting the TI process.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

Using a dataset of 5,856\npediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the\nCross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and\n99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that\narchitectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size,\nwith Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation.

Although these\nmodels have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most\nexisting approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the\nconstruction of a separate model for each time series, which results in\nsubstantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing\npenalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal\nrelationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions.

Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead.

We then examine how LLM\nagents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed\nreasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and\ncoordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,\nand adaptive cyber systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548cLLM\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u9759\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u535a\u5f08\uff09\u4e0eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e0eLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our\nwork demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and\neffective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRMR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u8f6c\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMRI\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u8f6c\u79fb\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "LRMR\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6587\u672cLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u60a3\u8005\u95f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5728117\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0cLRMR\u7684AUC\u4e3a0.7917\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5LLM\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u8f6c\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

IoT devices typically collect data\nfrom various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of\nthis data is temporal in nature.

However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions.

First, we create a novel\natlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,\nalong-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry\nwith two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract\nQuantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the\nproposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in\ndetecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,\nAGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which\nare anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these\ndemonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially\nlocalized WM group-level differences.

As such,\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of\nhardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding\nfor coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard\nnature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly\noutputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the\nintended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by\ndirectly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability\nof the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC\nfunctions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is\nproposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum\nrate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the\nproposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission\n(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the\nDAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs\nrespectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal\nprocessing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in\noverall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for\nbaseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for\nhigher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power\nconsumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other\ncomponents, are not considered in this analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7c97\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u548c\u901f\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86DAC\u529f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c04\u9891\u94fe\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cDAC\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u529f\u8017\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7c97\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u91cf\u5316\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Gumbel-softmax\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7c97\u91cf\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u5355\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75281\u4f4dDAC\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e3\u4f4dDAC\u7684MRT\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86DAC\u529f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4eDAC\u529f\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0b\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u529f\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3002"}}

These reviews also provide\ndevelopers with valuable insights into improving apps by addressing issues and\nintroducing better features. However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of\nreviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related\nconcerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software\nutilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant,\nprivacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine\nlearning.

This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated\nonline annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user\nreviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's\nKappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement\nfor training machine learning models. Among the models tested, GRACE\ndemonstrated the best performance (macro F1-score: 0.9434, macro ROC-AUC:\n0.9934, and accuracy: 95.10%) despite class imbalance.

We first\ncompute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between\nadjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path\ndistances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices\nwhich we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the\nproperties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate\ndenoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high\nprobability.

A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": "Accepted by ICML2025 as a poster", "summary": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\uff08\u5982SVD\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u53cc\u5203\u5251\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\uff08\u5982SVD\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86SVD\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cSVD\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u9002\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982512\u30011024\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u5f31\u589e\u5f3a\u548cSVD\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The\nMCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct\ncharacteristics of individual modality combinations.

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets.

This is further exacerbated by the\nfact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not\nwell-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix\nmultiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register\nfile and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely\nwithin a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.\nAt the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the\noriginal floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves\n1.77x and 4.83x higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS\nNeuronCore-v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only about 10% area\noverhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFSA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7fFlashAttention\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u5728\u6267\u884cFlashAttention\u65f6\u56e0\u9891\u7e41\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u975e\u77e9\u9635\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFSA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SystolicAttention\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u53e0\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "FSA\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529bFLOPs/s\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4AWS NeuronCore-v2\u548cGoogle TPUv5e\u5206\u522b\u9ad81.77\u500d\u548c4.83\u500d\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u7ea610%\u3002", "conclusion": "FSA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FlashAttention\u5728\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

However, it is challenging for\ncomputers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human\nPerception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based\nRepresentation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between\ncomputational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that\nallows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative\nevaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to\ntraditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our\nknowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for\ncolor attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable\nsample of the human population (n = 2496).
