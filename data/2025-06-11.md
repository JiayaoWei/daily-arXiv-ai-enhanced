### [1] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在关系抽取任务中表现出保守偏见，倾向于选择No_Relation标签，导致信息丢失。研究发现保守偏见比幻觉更常见，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在关系抽取任务中的保守偏见行为及其对信息损失的影响。

Method: 通过多种提示、数据集和关系类型系统评估保守偏见，引入Hobson's choice概念，并使用SBERT和LLM提示量化语义相似性。

Result: 保守偏见的发生频率是幻觉的两倍，且保守行为在约束提示和半约束/开放式提示生成的标签间存在语义相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs的保守偏见虽避免错误关系分配，但导致信息损失，需进一步优化模型行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

### [2] [QA-LIGN: Aligning LLMs through Constitutionally Decomposed QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08123)
*Jacob Dineen,Aswin RRV,Qin Liu,Zhikun Xu,Xiao Ye,Ming Shen,Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Chitta Baral,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QA-LIGN是一种自动符号奖励分解方法，通过为每个原则生成独立的奖励组件，提升语言模型对齐的透明度和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励对齐方法将多样反馈压缩为单一标量奖励，导致目标不透明且难以解释。

Method: QA-LIGN为每个原则设计评估问题，生成独立的奖励组件，替代传统的黑盒奖励模型。

Result: 实验显示，QA-LIGN在透明度和适应性上优于基线方法，性能与DPO基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: QA-LIGN为语言模型对齐提供了更可解释和可控的解决方案，且不影响任务性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

### [3] [EconWebArena: Benchmarking Autonomous Agents on Economic Tasks in Realistic Web Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08136)
*Zefang Liu,Yinzhu Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EconWebArena是一个用于评估自主代理在复杂、多模态经济任务中的表现的基准测试，包含360个任务，覆盖多个经济领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对权威数据源和多模态经济推理的重视，EconWebArena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过大型语言模型生成候选任务，并经过人工筛选，确保任务的清晰性、可行性和数据可靠性。

Result: 评估显示多模态LLMs在导航、多模态理解和数据提取方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: EconWebArena为经济领域的网络智能提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

### [4] [Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Social Media Using Translation-Based Approaches with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08147)
*Muhammad Usman,Muhammad Ahmad,M. Shahiki Tash,Irina Gelbukh,Rolando Quintero Tellez,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于注意力层和多语言数据集（英语、乌尔都语、西班牙语）的仇恨言论检测方法，结合了Transformer模型和传统机器学习模型，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全和包容性，但乌尔都语的仇恨言论检测研究较少，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 构建了一个三语言数据集，使用注意力层增强特征提取，结合Transformer模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo、Qwen 2.5 72B）和传统模型（如SVM）进行检测。

Result: 模型在英语、西班牙语、乌尔都语及多语言任务中表现优异，F1分数显著提升（最高8.97%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

### [5] [ETT-CKGE: Efficient Task-driven Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08158)
*Lijing Zhu,Qizhen Lan,Qing Tian,Wenbo Sun,Li Yang,Lu Xia,Yixin Xie,Xi Xiao,Tiehang Duan,Cui Tao,Shuteng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE提出了一种高效、任务驱动的持续知识图谱嵌入方法，通过可学习的任务相关令牌实现知识迁移，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在效率和可扩展性上存在不足，主要由于手动设计的节点/关系重要性评分忽略了图依赖关系，以及计算成本高昂的图遍历。

Method: 引入任务驱动的可学习令牌，直接捕获任务相关信号，避免显式节点评分或遍历，通过简单的矩阵操作实现知识迁移。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，ETT-CKGE表现出优越或竞争性的预测性能，同时显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE通过任务驱动的令牌设计，解决了现有方法的效率问题，为持续知识图谱嵌入提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

### [6] [Can Artificial Intelligence Write Like Borges? An Evaluation Protocol for Spanish Microfiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08172)
*Gerardo Aleman Manzanarez,Nora de la Cruz Arana,Jorge Garcia Flores,Yobany Garcia Medina,Raul Monroy,Nathalie Pernelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GrAImes协议，基于文学理论评估AI生成的微小说，关注主题一致性、文本清晰度、解释深度和美学质量，并通过专家验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI能生成连贯的短篇小说，但对其文学价值的评估缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 提出GrAImes协议，结合文学理论，为AI生成的微小说提供客观评估框架，并通过专家和文学爱好者验证。

Result: 验证结果显示GrAImes协议能有效评估AI生成微小说的文学价值。

Conclusion: GrAImes协议为评估AI生成微小说的文学价值提供了基础，填补了相关研究空白。

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

### [7] [LLM-BT: Back-Translation as a Framework for Terminology Standardization and Dynamic Semantic Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08174)
*Li Weigang,Pedro Carvalho Brom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-BT是一种基于大语言模型的反向翻译框架，用于自动化术语验证和标准化，通过跨语言语义对齐实现高一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家驱动的标准化方法难以应对快速增长的英语技术术语，尤其是在AI和量子计算等快速发展的领域，手动方法无法保证多语言一致性。

Method: LLM-BT采用反向翻译框架，结合术语级一致性验证、多路径验证工作流以及将反向翻译视为动态语义嵌入的方法。

Result: 实验显示，LLM-BT在术语一致性上表现优异（超过90%的匹配率），并在跨语言鲁棒性上表现良好（BLEU > 0.45，葡萄牙语准确率100%）。

Conclusion: LLM-BT将反向翻译转化为多语言术语标准化的主动引擎，支持人机协作，为全球科技领域的术语治理提供基础设施。

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

### [8] [Unable to forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184)
*Chupei Wang,Jiaqiu Vince Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在信息检索中易受上下文干扰影响，导致检索准确性下降，提示其工作记忆存在瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在信息检索中受上下文干扰的影响，揭示其工作记忆能力的局限性。

Method: 采用认知科学中的主动干扰（PI）范式，设计PI-LLM评估方法，测试LLMs在语义相关更新流中的检索表现。

Result: LLMs的检索准确性随干扰累积呈对数线性下降，提示模型难以抑制无关内容。

Conclusion: LLMs在信息检索中存在工作记忆瓶颈，需开发新方法以增强其抑制干扰的能力。

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

### [9] ["I Wrote, I Paused, I Rewrote" Teaching LLMs to Read Between the Lines of Student Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08221)
*Samra Zafar,Shaheer Minhas,Syed Ali Hassan Zaidi,Arfa Naeem,Zahra Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨利用写作过程数据（如击键记录和定期快照）改进大型语言模型（LLM）的反馈效果，发现学生更偏好基于过程的反馈，且某些编辑行为与写作质量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反馈仅基于最终文本，缺乏对写作过程的了解，可能无法准确反映学生的思考和修改过程。

Method: 开发数字写作工具记录学生写作过程，20名学生使用时限写作任务，比较基于最终文本和全过程的LLM反馈，并通过调查评估反馈效果。

Result: 学生更偏好基于过程的反馈，某些编辑行为（如新增内容或段落重组）与写作质量（如连贯性和详述）正相关。

Conclusion: 提升LLM对写作过程的感知能力，可提供更个性化、有意义的反馈。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

*Yu-Ang Lee,Guan-Ting Yi,Mei-Yi Liu,Jui-Chao Lu,Guan-Bo Yang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了复合AI系统优化的最新进展，包括数值和基于语言的技术，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复合AI系统的复杂性增加，优化组件及其交互成为新挑战，需要探索新方法。

Method: 系统回顾了复合AI系统优化的进展，形式化了优化概念，并对现有方法进行了分类。

Result: 总结了数值和语言反馈技术在优化中的应用，并指出了开放研究问题。

Conclusion: 复合AI系统优化是一个快速发展的领域，未来需进一步探索非可微分系统的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/AISysOpt-Survey.

*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Yupeng Cao,Haohang Li,Yangyang Yu,Nikhil Muralidhar,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM-BENCH是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）在科学论文中提取和验证声明与证据能力的基准测试，揭示了LLMs在处理复杂科学内容时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够真正理解和处理复杂研究论文中的逻辑关系，如声明与支持证据之间的联系。

Method: 通过系统比较三种启发于分治策略的方法，在六种不同的LLMs上进行评估，涉及300多个声明-证据对。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4和Claude）在精确度和召回率上优于开源模型，且三遍和逐一提示策略显著提升了LLMs的能力，但计算成本增加。

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH为评估LLMs的科学理解能力设定了新标准，并为构建更可靠的推理系统提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

### [12] [Automatic Generation of Inference Making Questions for Reading Comprehension Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08260)
*Wanjing Anya Ma,Michael Flor,Zuowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了阅读理解中的推理能力，提出了一种推理类型的分类法，并利用GPT-4o生成诊断性阅读理解题目，实验结果显示生成题目质量较高，但准确匹配目标推理类型的比例较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阅读理解中的推理能力复杂且重要，诊断性问题能帮助教育者提供更有针对性的教学干预。

Method: 提出推理类型分类法，利用GPT-4o通过few-shot提示生成题目，比较有无链式思维提示的效果。

Result: GPT-4o生成93.8%的高质量题目，但仅42.6%准确匹配目标推理类型。

Conclusion: 结合自动生成与人工判断，可扩展高质量诊断性阅读理解评估。

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

TL;DR: 该技术报告介绍了Institutional Books 1.0，一个基于哈佛图书馆公共领域书籍的大规模数据集，旨在支持高质量语言模型的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量公开训练数据的稀缺性，需要可持续的数据管理实践，以提升语言模型的质量。

Method: 通过与哈佛图书馆合作，提取、分析和处理了约100万卷书籍的OCR文本和元数据，涵盖250种语言。

Result: 发布了983,004卷公共领域书籍的文本和元数据，总计242B tokens，为研究提供了丰富的历史文本资源。

Conclusion: 该项目通过提供高质量、多样化的历史数据集，支持语言模型的训练和研究，同时强调了数据管理的可持续性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented
dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard
Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of

TL;DR: NoWait通过禁用显式自我反思标记（如“Wait”和“Hmm”）来减少推理过程中的冗余输出，显著缩短推理轨迹长度，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中常因过度思考产生冗余输出，影响效率。研究探讨显式自我反思是否必要。

Method: 提出NoWait方法，通过抑制自我反思标记（如“Wait”和“Hmm”）来简化推理过程。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，NoWait将推理轨迹长度减少27%-51%，且不影响模型性能。

Conclusion: NoWait是一种即插即用的高效多模态推理解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同认知层次上的能力，尤其是在医学领域的表现，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出多认知层次评估框架，整合现有医学数据集并设计针对三个认知层次的任务，评估六类主流LLMs。

Result: 随着认知复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降，模型规模在更高认知层次中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究强调需提升LLMs在更高认知层次的医学能力，为开发适合实际医学应用的LLMs提供见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

TL;DR: 本文主张文本嵌入研究应超越表层语义，聚焦隐含语义，提出需改进训练数据、评估基准和建模目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型主要关注表层语义，忽视了隐含语义（如语用、说话者意图和社会文化背景），导致其在需要深层语义理解的任务中表现不佳。

Method: 通过初步研究展示现有模型在隐含语义任务上的局限性，并提出改进方向。

Result: 研究发现，即使是先进模型在隐含语义任务上表现仅略优于简单基线。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区转向更注重隐含语义的建模，改进数据、基准和目标，以更好地应对现实语言的复杂性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖表面线索或临时启发式，导致模块选择不理想或产生意外结果，需更原则性的方法。

Method: 训练VQ-AE量化注意力头的激活空间，通过二元分类指标评估行为相关性，生成行为相关性分数。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能更准确地识别行为相关注意力头，提升推理时干预效果，具有跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应检索方法Adaptive-$k$，通过动态调整检索段落数量，解决了固定检索大小在开放域问答中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成（RAG）和长上下文语言模型（LCLMs）在开放域问答中固定检索大小导致的效率低下或关键信息遗漏问题。

Method: 提出Adaptive-$k$检索方法，基于查询与候选段落相似度分数的分布动态选择段落数量，无需模型微调或额外推理。

Result: 在事实性和聚合性问答基准测试中，Adaptive-$k$性能优于固定检索方法，且使用更少的token，同时检索到70%的相关段落。

Conclusion: 动态调整上下文大小能显著提升问答系统的效率和准确性，适用于多种模型和嵌入方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在专业领域因果推理中的不足，标准RAG缺乏结构化建模能力。

Method: 引入CC-RAG，构建DAG图并通过前向/后向链指导结构化答案生成。

Result: 在比特币价格波动和高雪病领域，CC-RAG在链相似性、信息密度和词汇多样性上优于标准RAG和零样本LLMs。

Conclusion: 显式建模因果结构能提升LLMs在专业领域的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在处理长上下文时性能下降，现有解决方案训练成本高昂，且统计行为和成本效益方法研究不足。

Method: 从解码角度识别了Posterior Salience Attenuation（PSA）现象，并提出PCD方法，通过对比长上下文和局部上下文的注意力得分，提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，PCD在长上下文基准测试中达到最先进性能，有效缓解注意力得分退化问题。

Conclusion: PCD是一种无需训练的高效方法，显著提升LLMs在长文本中的表现。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Transformer的二次计算和线性内存复杂度，优化长上下文LLM推理变得重要。现有方法依赖粗略的预测，准确性不足。

Method: 提出两种方法：SpecKV（利用草稿输出评估KV对重要性以优化KV缓存丢弃）和SpecPC（利用草稿模型的注意力激活识别并丢弃不重要提示词）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长上下文基准测试中准确性优于现有基线，同时保持了内存、延迟和吞吐量的改进。

Conclusion: 草稿模型在近似LLM推理中的首次应用，扩展了其用途，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注单任务环境，无法反映真实场景的复杂性，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 设计了EIFBENCH基准测试，包含多任务场景和多种约束条件，并提出SegPO算法提升LLMs的多任务处理能力。

Result: 评估显示现有LLMs在复杂指令下表现差异显著，表明仍需进一步优化。

Conclusion: EIFBENCH为LLMs的复杂指令跟随能力提供了更真实的评估标准，SegPO算法有助于提升模型性能。

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Result: 高资源与低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更多投资来解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Conclusion: TACTIC通过认知理论驱动的多智能体协作，有效提升了LLMs的翻译质量，为机器翻译领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs的认知错误检测能力，而忽略了其元认知能力（如对步骤错误的自我意识），这对可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出AutoMeco框架用于评估现有元认知指标，并引入无训练的MIRA策略以提升这些指标。

Result: 在三个数学推理数据集和三个LLMs上的实验表明，AutoMeco的合理性，且MIRA能更好地评估LLMs的元认知能力。

Conclusion: AutoMeco和MIRA为LLMs的元认知能力评估提供了有效工具，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型（LLM）成本高昂，且容易受主流文化和价值观影响。领域适应虽能改善模型与多样化文化背景的匹配，但其计算成本仍是障碍。

Result: 研究结果为能源效率、可访问性或硬件资源有限的环境提供了实用参考。

Conclusion: 通过优化数值精度和并行化策略，可以降低领域适应的计算成本，促进低资源环境下的应用。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training

### [29] [Olica: Efficient Structured Pruning of Large Language Models without Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08436)
*Jiujun He,Huazhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的LLM剪枝框架Olica，通过正交分解和线性校准压缩模型，保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM结构化剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源重新训练，成本高昂。

Method: 利用PCA处理多头注意力层的矩阵乘积，设计快速分解方法；通过线性校准和SVD解决FFN层剪枝误差累积问题。

Result: Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Olica无需重新训练即可高效压缩LLM，保持性能，解决了现有方法的资源消耗问题。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: U-CoT+是一个新框架，通过将视觉模因转换为文本描述，结合人类制定的指导原则，实现高效、灵活且可解释的有害模因检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前有害模因检测方法在资源效率、灵活性和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了实际部署。

Method: 开发高保真模因转文本管道，结合零样本CoT提示和人类指导原则，利用小型LLMs进行分类。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验验证了框架的有效性，支持低资源、可解释的有害模因检测。

Conclusion: U-CoT+为有害模因检测提供了高效、灵活且可解释的解决方案，适用于不同平台和地区。

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are
available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HMC-AF2B/README.md.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有文本到图像生成评估框架的不足，提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖人类判断，忽略了评估框架的其他关键特性。

Method: 识别可靠评估的两个关键方面，实证分析当前主流框架的不足。

Result: 当前评估框架未能全面满足可靠评估的需求。

Conclusion: 提出改进图像-文本对齐评估的建议。

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中的快速应用，对其伦理风险的理解滞后，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用BBQ基准测试，在零样本提示下评估了9个开源模型的实用性和公平性，涵盖Qwen 2.5、LLaMA 3.2、Gemma 3和Phi系列。

Result: 研究发现：1）Phi模型在高效与伦理上表现优异；2）不同架构的模型在偏见上差异显著；3）量化压缩带来复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中的SLMs负责任部署提供了实用指导，特别适用于小型企业和资源受限场景。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: EtiCor++为评估LLMs的礼仪知识和偏见提供了有效工具，揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

<details>

Motivation: 监督方法依赖标记数据且难以处理域外意图，限制了实际应用。广义意图发现（GID）旨在利用未标记数据发现新意图，但现有方法忽视域适应问题。

Method: 提出原型提示框架（用于迁移旧知识）和分层一致性约束（用于学习新知识）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且泛化能力强，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

Method: 提出知识冲突分类法，构建CONFLICTS基准测试，并进行实验评估LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在解决冲突时表现不佳，但显式推理提示能显著提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 未来研究仍需改进LLMs处理知识冲突的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models
highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards
the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级后训练框架，通过对比推理反馈和残差嵌入细化来优化潜在推理轨迹，显著提升了推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）在显式中间步骤和固定推理轨迹上的局限性，以及如何有效更新后训练中的推理嵌入。

Method: 1) 对比推理反馈：通过比较强和弱基线推理嵌入来推断更新方向；2) 残差嵌入细化：通过渐进整合当前和历史梯度稳定更新。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中验证了框架的有效性，例如在MathQA上实现了5%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了推理任务的性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

Motivation: 探索基于语音嵌入的大规模语言关系分析方法，以补充传统历史语言学方法。

Method: 使用XLS-R模型的语音嵌入，通过线性判别分析（LDA）聚类语言，并与谱系、词汇和地理距离对比。

Result: 嵌入方法与传统方法结果一致，能捕捉全局和局部语言模式，但可视化语言关系存在挑战。

Conclusion: 语音嵌入方法为语言变异研究提供了新视角，未来可扩展至低资源语言和社会语言学变异。

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

Conclusion: 未来LLM推理能力的进一步提升将简化社交推理游戏系统的设计。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Method: 开发CounselBench基准，包含专家评估（CounselBench-EVAL）和对抗性问题（CounselBench-Adv），评估LLM在六个临床维度上的表现。

Result: LLM在感知质量上优于人类治疗师，但常被专家标记安全隐患；LLM评委高估模型表现且忽视安全问题。

Conclusion: CounselBench为高风险的LLM心理健康应用提供了临床基准和改进框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中可能导致学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，需要一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: POCL框架包含难度测量器和训练调度器，前者对样本按难度排序，后者逐步引入样本并应用温度递增的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: POCL通过结构化训练数据提升了KD过程的稳定性和性能，为大语言模型蒸馏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Result: 发现人格提示导致模型输出显著差异，包括与真实标签的不一致、人格间分歧和逻辑层面的偏见。

Conclusion: 需谨慎定义人格提示以确保LLM标注的公平性和与人类价值观的一致性。

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated

RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

TL;DR: MEMETRON框架通过离散黑盒优化问题重新定义LLM解码，利用混合元启发式算法搜索高奖励响应，无需模型重训练或梯度访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的解码策略（如贪婪搜索、采样或重排序）缺乏对任务特定目标的明确优化，限制了控制能力。

Method: MEMETRON将LLM解码视为离散黑盒优化问题，结合GENETRON和ANNETRON算法，通过奖励模型和LLM的上下文操作指导搜索。

Result: 在人类偏好对齐任务中，MEMETRON显著优于标准解码和重排序方法。

Conclusion: MEMETRON展示了无需模型重训练即可改善对齐的潜力，具有模块化和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

TL;DR: TableDreamer框架通过渐进式和弱点导向的数据合成方法，解决了现有LLM在表格指令调优数据生成中的多样性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成表格指令调优数据时，无法充分探索输入空间且忽视目标LLM的弱点，导致数据多样性和效率不足。

Method: TableDreamer首先生成多样化的种子数据，然后基于新发现的弱点数据迭代探索输入空间，最终生成训练数据。

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer将Llama3.1-8B-instruct的平均准确率提升11.62%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer通过弱点导向的数据合成，显著提升了表格指令调优的效果和效率。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

Motivation: 研究肠道微生物组这一低资源生物医学领域中的关系提取问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行摘要生成以优化上下文，再通过指令调整生成关系。

Result: 摘要生成提高了生成式关系提取的性能，但BERT方法仍表现更好。

Conclusion: 生成式方法在低资源专业领域研究中具有潜力。

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

TL;DR: RuleReasoner是一种通过强化学习提升小型推理模型在规则推理任务中表现的方法，显著优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型推理模型在多样化任务和领域中规则推理的泛化能力问题。

Method: 采用领域感知动态采样方法，通过历史奖励更新采样权重，实现灵活的在线学习。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中表现优于前沿大型模型，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner为小型模型提供了一种高效、灵活的规则推理解决方案。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）推理过程中的能源消耗问题，提出通过输出压缩和提示工程策略减少响应长度，实现25-60%的能源优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs推理过程消耗大量能源，而输出压缩领域研究较少。论文旨在通过优化响应长度来降低能源消耗。

Method: 对12个仅解码器LLMs在5个数据集上进行基准测试，定义LLM响应中的六类信息，并探索提示工程策略以减少冗余信息。

Result: 适当的提示策略可减少响应长度25-60%，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 通过提示工程优化LLM响应长度是一种有效的能源节约方法。

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

Motivation: 科学事实核查主要关注文本和表格，忽略了科学图表的重要性，而图表是展示定量证据和统计推理的关键。

Method: 引入ClimateViz基准，包含标注的图表和结构化知识图谱解释，评估多模态语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: 当前模型在图表推理上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅为76.2-77.8%，远低于人类水平（89.3-92.7%）。

Conclusion: 图表推理仍具挑战性，解释增强输出可提升部分模型性能，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

TL;DR: ConfPO是一种用于大型语言模型（LLM）偏好学习的方法，通过优化偏好关键令牌，无需额外模型或计算资源，提高对齐质量并减少过优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接对齐算法（如DPO）对所有令牌进行统一调整，而ConfPO专注于对偏好影响最大的令牌进行优化，以提高效率和效果。

Method: ConfPO基于训练策略的置信度识别和优化偏好关键令牌，避免使用辅助模型或额外计算资源。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，ConfPO表现优于统一调整的算法，且无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ConfPO是一种简单、轻量且高效的方法，显著提升LLM的偏好对齐效果。

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

Motivation: 复杂系统合规性检测面临法律和技术文本复杂、模型解释需求高以及保证案例数据有限等挑战。

Method: 将保证案例的声明-论证-证据结构建模为多跳推理，利用大语言模型生成保证案例，并引入覆盖率和结构一致性度量。

Result: 通过GDPR要求的多跳推理任务验证了生成保证案例的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于NLI的方法在自动化合规检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单语言语音情感识别已取得进展，但构建多语言系统仍具挑战性，因此目标是训练一个通用的多语言模型。

Method: 采用语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法，以Wav2Vec2.0为基础构建单语言教师模型，并将其知识蒸馏到多语言学生模型中。

Result: 学生模型在英语数据集上加权召回率为72.9，芬兰语数据集上未加权召回率为63.4，优于微调和知识蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了悲伤和中性情感的识别，但在愤怒和快乐情感识别上仍有挑战。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Result: 改进的批评代理和计算器代理在性能上优于现有方法，且更安全。

Conclusion: 论文展示了改进代理的有效性，并探讨了代理间交互对性能的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Method: 开发分类器识别论文中的社会内容，分析跨学科与纯计算机科学团队的社会导向研究占比。

Result: 纯计算机科学团队的社会导向研究占比增加，涉及公平、安全、医疗等多个领域。

Conclusion: 挑战了跨学科团队主导社会导向研究的假设，引发对AI安全和治理的思考，以及社会科学和人文科学在AI发展中的独特贡献。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Conclusion: 未来方向包括扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调，以提升模型在核领域的准确性，并评估其在实际应用中的准备情况。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses

Motivation: 传统NL-to-SQL方法在核电站等关键系统中存在风险，如生成的SQL查询难以验证，且复杂数据库结构增加了错误概率。

Result: 相比直接NL-to-SQL生成，函数调用方法显著提高了查询准确性和可维护性。

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡用户易用性和操作安全性方面提供了新框架，适用于关键系统的数据检索。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,
and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从法律文档中提取交通事故信息的两步法，通过文本分割和实体提取，比较了传统方法和基于语义搜索的方法，并展示了微调后LLaMA模型性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化保险公司成本需要从法律文档中提取交通事故信息，但由于法院判决中的复杂论证，即使是专家也难以准确提取相关实体。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 文本分割（比较正则表达式和语义块向量化方法）；2) 使用LLMs（如LLaMA和GPT-4 Turbo）进行实体提取，并对LLaMA模型进行微调。

Result: 基于语义搜索和LLMs的方法显著优于传统方法（39.5%准确率）。微调后的LLaMA-2 70B达到79.4%，而GPT-4 Turbo表现最佳（86.1%）。

Conclusion: 语义分割结合LLMs的方法有效提升了实体提取的准确性，尤其是微调后的LLaMA模型和GPT-4 Turbo表现突出。

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SRB-300数据集，用于提升瑞士德语（低资源语言）的语音转文本（STT）模型性能，通过微调Whisper模型显著降低了错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞士德语缺乏标准化书写形式且方言多样，现有STT模型在自然对话中表现不佳，需要更真实的数据集。

Method: 使用SRB-300数据集（300小时真实广播录音）微调多个Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后模型性能显著提升，最佳模型WER降至17.1%，BLEU得分达74.8%。

Conclusion: SRB-300数据集和微调方法为低资源语言的STT系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLMs在对抗性攻击中的几何盲点，提出了ALKALI基准和GRACE框架以提升防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的防御机制无法有效应对快速演变的对抗性威胁，尤其是潜在几何伪装攻击。

Method: 引入ALKALI基准评估21种LLMs的脆弱性，并提出GRACE框架，结合潜在空间正则化和偏好学习。

Result: GRACE显著降低了攻击成功率（ASR）达39%，并提出了量化潜在对齐失败的AVQI指标。

Conclusion: 论文通过几何感知方法提升了LLMs的安全性，为未来的防御研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

Motivation: 植物科学领域缺乏专门的语言模型工具，而现有的通用模型无法满足其需求。PlantBert旨在填补这一空白，提供高精度的领域适应模型。

Method: 基于DeBERTa架构，结合规则增强的语言后处理和基于本体的实体规范化，对专家标注的植物胁迫响应文献进行微调。

Result: PlantBert在实体类型上表现出强大的泛化能力，证明了在低资源科学领域进行领域适应的可行性。

Conclusion: PlantBert为农业NLP提供了可扩展且可复现的框架，推动了植物科学领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

Motivation: 旨在通过自动化方法解决法律文本语义分析的复杂性，提高法律信息学的可扩展性。

Method: 采用结构化流程，将复杂法律语言分解为原子片段，提取道义规则，并评估其语法和语义一致性，同时测试多种LLM配置。

Result: 实验结果显示，机器生成的形式化表示与专家手工制作的表示具有良好一致性，表明LLM在有效提示下对法律信息学有显著贡献。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化法律文本分析中具有潜力，特别是在有效提示策略下，能够为法律信息学提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs
- particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to
scalable legal informatics.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言和方言在自然语言理解系统中的挑战，通过标准化方言文本以适配标准语言工具。

Method: 结合基于规则的语言学转换和大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本提示，无需平行数据。

Result: 在希腊方言数据集上验证了方法的有效性，发现以往研究仅依赖表层语言信息，而新方法能保留更多语义。

Conclusion: 新方法为方言标准化提供了有效途径，揭示了以往研究的局限性，并展示了语义保留的重要性。

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术无法有效传播注入的知识，导致模型无法回答需要推理的问题。

Method: 采用超网络方法，扩展MEND的元目标，通过修改梯度更新来支持多跳问题的推理。

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现优异，多跳问题准确率提升近2倍；在Controlled RippleEdit数据集上，对未见实体-关系对的泛化能力仍优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现突出，但未见实体-关系对的性能差距缩小，未来需进一步优化广泛关系下的知识传播。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，高性能AI研究可以通过资源优化实现普及，降低了技术门槛。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end
hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming
GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating
reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing

Result: 实验表明，FaithfulRAG优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaithfulRAG有效解决了知识冲突问题，提升了生成结果的忠实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is

Motivation: 研究LLMs在政治领域中的表现，关注其是否能有效纠正用户的错误信念，以减少误导信息的传播。

Method: 通过直接知识问题和预设误导信息的负载问题，评估LLMs的回应能力，分析其知识水平和政治偏见的影响。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在纠正错误信念和建立共同背景方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在政治话语中减少误导信息的能力有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

Result: 发现语言模型在预训练后能精确表示数字，且这种精确性与算术错误相关，通过调整嵌入可以减轻错误。

Conclusion: 新探测技术揭示了语言模型中数字表示的高精度，并提供了减少算术错误的方法。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

Conclusion: SpeechMaturity数据集显著提升了儿童语音分类任务的性能，为相关研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child
speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech
pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer
models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child
vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally
ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SWE-Flow是一个基于测试驱动开发（TDD）的数据合成框架，通过单元测试自动推断增量开发步骤，生成可验证的TDD任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件工程数据依赖人工提交的问题，SWE-Flow旨在通过单元测试自动生成开发步骤，提高数据质量和效率。

Method: 构建运行时依赖图（RDG）以捕捉函数交互，生成结构化的开发计划，包括部分代码库、单元测试和代码修改。

Result: 从真实GitHub项目中生成16,061个训练实例和2,020个测试实例，实验表明在TDD编码任务中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SWE-Flow为TDD任务提供了高质量的数据集和工具，推动了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at
[Github](https://github.com/Hambaobao/SWE-Flow).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了第二语言韩语的通用依存标注工作，提出了一种半自动化框架，用于从XPOS序列中识别形态句法结构，并将其与UPOS类别对齐。同时扩充了L2韩语语料库，标注了2998个新句子。实验表明，对齐数据集提高了标注一致性和分析准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展L2韩语的通用依存标注工作，解决形态句法结构识别与UPOS类别对齐的问题，并提升语料库规模。

Method: 提出半自动化框架，从XPOS序列识别形态句法结构并对齐UPOS类别；扩充语料库；使用两种NLP工具包对对齐与非对齐数据集进行微调。

Result: 对齐数据集提高了标注一致性，并提升了形态句法标注和依存分析的准确性，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: XPOS-UPOS对齐框架有效提升了L2韩语的形态句法分析性能，尤其在数据有限时表现更优。

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those
constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing
L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these
alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned
dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also
enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly
in cases of limited annotated data.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法SSA，通过训练小型LLM聚合多个样本答案，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时计算扩展可提升LLM性能，但现有方法（如多数投票或验证器）效率有限。

Method: 训练小型LLM（SSA）以聚合多个样本答案，通过强化学习优化准确性。

Result: SSA在多个推理数据集上优于其他测试时扩展方法，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: SSA能高效利用黑盒模型输出，分离生成与分析任务，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类与三种LLM（ChatGPT-4o、Llama3.1-8b、Deepseek-r1-8b）在第二语言写作校对中的表现，发现两者均能提升词汇连贯性，但LLM更倾向于生成性修改，且三种模型结果高度一致。

Motivation: 探讨人类与LLM在第二语言写作校对中的干预效果及其一致性。

Method: 比较人类与三种LLM对相同第二语言写作的词汇和句法修改，分析其效果。

Result: 人类和LLM均提升词汇连贯性，LLM修改更具生成性，三种模型结果一致。

Conclusion: LLM校对在词汇和句法修改上表现一致且高效，但生成性修改可能影响原文风格。

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

TL;DR: Router-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态路由和聚合多个LLM的能力，优化复杂任务的性能与成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器通常仅支持单轮、一对一的模型分配，无法充分利用多个LLM的互补优势。

Method: Router-R1将路由和聚合建模为序列决策过程，利用LLM的推理能力动态调用模型，并通过轻量级规则奖励指导学习。

Result: 在七个通用和多跳QA基准测试中，Router-R1表现优于多个基线，实现了性能与成本的优化。

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习实现了多LLM的动态路由与聚合，为性能与成本权衡提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）在文本任务上表现优于视觉任务，通过分析任务特定计算子图（circuits）发现模态间差异主要在数据处理位置。通过将视觉数据表征从后期层修补到早期层，性能差距缩小了三分之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型在视觉和文本任务上表现差异的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 识别并比较不同模态的任务特定计算子图（circuits），分析其功能差异，并通过修补视觉数据表征来优化性能。

Result: 将后期层的视觉数据表征修补到早期层后，性能差距平均缩小了三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态性能差距的原因，并提出了一种无需训练的改进方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

Motivation: 高频率金融系统对延迟有严格要求，需要一种能在不确定工作负载下动态选择深度学习模型的方法。

Method: TIP-Search通过离线分析延迟和泛化性能，在线进行任务感知选择，无需依赖显式输入域标签。

Result: 在三个真实订单簿数据集上测试，TIP-Search比静态基线准确率提高8.5%，且100%满足截止时间。

Conclusion: TIP-Search在不确定环境下实现了低延迟、高鲁棒性的金融推理。

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling
framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated
by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search
dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to
maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints.
Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then
performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain
labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets
(FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms
static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline
satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust
low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cognitive Weave的新型记忆框架，通过多层时空共振图（STRG）管理信息，显著提升了任务完成率和查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前记忆系统在结构灵活性、时间感知和从原始数据中提取高层次洞察方面存在局限性，需要更先进的架构。

Method: 采用多层的时空共振图（STRG）和语义丰富的洞察粒子（IPs），通过语义预言接口（SOI）动态丰富信息，并通过认知精炼过程生成高层次知识结构。

Result: Cognitive Weave在长期规划任务、动态问答场景和多会话对话连贯性方面表现优异，任务完成率平均提升34%，查询延迟降低42%。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM记忆系统提供了创新解决方案，并探讨了伦理问题和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了SOP-Bench，一个用于测试LLM在工业自动化中执行复杂标准操作流程（SOPs）能力的基准，并揭示了当前LLM代理在此任务上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在执行复杂、长期工作流程时表现不佳，缺乏反映工业SOP复杂性的公开基准。

Method: 开发了合成数据生成框架和SOP-Bench基准，包含1,800多个任务，评估了两种代理架构（Function-Calling和ReAct Agents）。

Result: 两种代理的平均成功率仅为27%和48%，工具注册过大时错误率接近100%。

Conclusion: LLM代理能力与工业SOP需求存在显著差距，需领域特定基准和架构优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

Result: 论文呼吁开发基于结构化、伦理数据的AI辅助系统，并提出了研究议程和技术挑战。

Conclusion: 机器学习社区应积极推动AI辅助评审的发展，以维护科学验证的完整性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

Motivation: 解决在细粒度时间约束下ASP的可扩展性问题，避免因时间精度导致的性能瓶颈。

Method: 利用ASP的扩展，引入差异约束（一种简化的线性约束）外部处理时间相关部分。

Result: 实现了不受时间精度影响的解决方案，有效提升了处理定量时间约束的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了度量ASP中的时间约束问题，同时保持了系统的可扩展性。

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and
deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with
fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's
grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with
difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle
time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP
from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by
time precision.

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

Motivation: 开发一个能够帮助学生理解和完成数学证明的智能辅导系统，结合自然语言和形式化验证的优势。

Method: 系统由三个模块组成：自动形式化/证明检查器、下一步生成器和自然语言反馈生成器，分别负责验证证明、生成下一步策略和提供教学反馈。

Result: 在PeanoBench数据集上，自动形式化模块正确形式化了57%的正确证明步骤，并在30%的错误证明中准确识别错误步骤；反馈生成器在准确性和相关性上优于基线。

Conclusion: LeanTutor展示了结合自然语言和形式化验证的潜力，为数学证明辅导提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: We present LeanTutor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring system for
math proofs. LeanTutor interacts with the student in natural language, formally
verifies student-written math proofs in Lean, generates correct next steps, and
provides the appropriate instructional guidance. LeanTutor is composed of three
modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and
(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路设计流程涉及大量参数配置，微小变化可能对性能、功耗和面积产生重大影响，LLM为高维优化任务提供了新的学习和推理机会。

Method: ORFS-agent通过自适应探索参数配置，结合自然语言目标进行多目标优化，无需额外微调即可与前沿LLM模块化集成。

Result: 实验表明，ORFS-agent在两种技术节点和多种电路基准测试中，可将布线长度和有效时钟周期提升13%以上，同时减少40%的优化迭代次数。

Conclusion: ORFS-agent展示了LLM在硬件设计优化中的潜力，提供了一种灵活且可解释的多目标优化框架。

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

TL;DR: FloorplanMAE是一个自监督学习框架，用于从不完整平面图预测完整平面图，提高设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图设计是动态迭代过程，预测完整平面图可帮助建筑师快速生成初步设计，减少重复修改工作量。

Method: 基于Masked Autoencoders (MAE)和轻量级Vision Transformer (ViT)，通过掩码部分平面图训练模型进行重建。

Result: 实验表明FloorplanMAE能高质量生成完整平面图，优于现有基准。

Conclusion: FloorplanMAE为平面图生成提供可扩展解决方案，应用前景广阔。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）能自动为更困难的问题分配更多推理强度（即推理标记数量），其机制与模型激活中的预分配方向向量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs自动分配推理强度的现象及其内部机制。

Method: 通过模型激活分析，发现LRMs在生成前通过预分配方向向量控制推理强度，并通过线性探针预测推理标记数量。

Result: 方向向量的幅度调节推理强度，增减该向量可改变推理标记数量和性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs推理的内部机制，并提供了控制推理行为的工具。

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在高风险或模糊场景中安全响应不足的问题。

Method: 利用规则化思维链监督，最小化监督帮助模型推理安全风险并做出上下文感知的拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，SafeCoT显著减少过度拒绝并提升泛化能力，即使训练数据有限。

Conclusion: SafeCoT为视觉语言模型的安全对齐提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的图后门攻击方法，通过插入单个虚假用户节点，隐蔽地提升目标物品对目标用户的曝光率，同时减少对推荐系统性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图推荐系统在面对攻击时存在低隐蔽性和高破坏性的问题，需要一种更隐蔽且破坏性更低的攻击方法。

Method: 设计了一个单节点触发器生成器，通过插入一个虚假用户节点来暴露多个目标物品，并引入目标节点与无关节点之间的约束条件以减少对系统性能的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，目标物品对目标用户的曝光率达到50%以上，且对推荐系统性能的影响控制在约5%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐蔽性和破坏性之间取得了平衡，为图推荐系统的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Result: 在概念必要性映射任务中，F1分数达到0.97，远超人工基准0.68。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量映射的同时，实现了分类法对齐的规模化，并为模糊案例保留了专家监督。

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Depths技术实现稀疏性，并开发基于上下文的聚类层以利用层次结构。

Result: 在9个真实地图和16种VRP变体上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHIELD通过动态计算分配和层次特征提取，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

Motivation: 传统基于观测数据的因果发现方法存在局限性，而基于知识的因果发现（利用变量元数据）是一种有潜力的替代方案。然而，现有LLM方法的结果不稳定且不一致，影响了可靠性。

Method: 通过知识图谱识别信息丰富的基于元路径的子图，并利用学习排序模型进一步优化子图选择。将排名靠前的子图融入零样本提示中，提升LLM的因果推理能力。

Conclusion: 结合KGs和LLMs的方法显著提升了基于知识的因果发现的性能和可靠性，为复杂系统中的因果推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Result: CIPHER在分布外任务中表现优异，能解释决策并生成精确指令。

Conclusion: CIPHER为工业自主系统提供了精准、透明和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗健康领域的应用增加，如何解决其带来的幻觉、偏见、透明度和伦理问题成为关键挑战。

Method: RHealthTwin通过Responsible Prompt Engine（RPE）动态提取预定义槽位，结构化输入，并结合反馈循环优化提示结构，确保生成安全、相关且可解释的响应。

Result: 在四个消费者健康领域的评估中，RPE在BLEU、ROUGE-L和BERTScore等指标上表现优异，伦理合规性和指令遵循率超过90%。

Conclusion: RHealthTwin为医疗健康领域提供了一种负责任的大型语言模型应用框架，具有前瞻性。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

Conclusion: FedTAIL在集中式和联邦设置中均有效，适用于领域偏移和标签不平衡问题。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了低空经济网络约束下的无人机轨迹规划关键挑战。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

Result: 实验表明HGformer在资源分配效率和对抗收益上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGformer在复杂动态游戏场景中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

Conclusion: FoldA技术有效解决了传统对齐方法的局限性，提升了并发行为的表示准确性。

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Conclusion: CoVo为无监督推理学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate
that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test. Our code

Motivation: 探讨LLM在数据科学中的应用，评估其作为助手和代理的现状与不足。

Method: 通过文献综述，分析LLM助手和代理在数据科学中的评估情况。

Result: 发现研究集中在目标导向活动，忽视数据管理和探索性活动；缺乏中间层次的人机协作；过度关注人类替代而非任务转型。

Conclusion: 未来研究应更全面地评估LLM在数据科学中的作用，包括探索性活动和中间层次协作，并关注任务转型的可能性。

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLM辅助写作对神经和行为的影响，发现LLM使用者在认知、语言和行为层面表现较差，引发对教育长期影响的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM辅助写作对认知和行为的潜在影响，评估其在教育中的长期作用。

Method: 54名参与者分为LLM、搜索引擎和纯大脑三组，通过EEG和NLP分析认知负荷和写作质量，并在第四阶段交换条件。

Result: LLM使用者脑连接最弱，认知活动减少，写作所有权感最低；纯大脑组表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM虽便利，但可能带来认知代价，需进一步研究AI在教育中的角色。

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted
essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,
and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same
condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group
(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition
(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18
completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive
load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

Motivation: 现有方法将所有子问题平等对待并使用单一模型解决，限制了解决方案空间的探索，导致性能不佳。

Method: 设计了条件计算块将子问题路由到专用神经架构，并提出基于偏好的优化算法学习解决方案间的偏好关系。

Result: 在四个经典MOCOP基准测试中，POCCO表现出显著优势和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: POCCO通过自适应模型选择和偏好驱动优化，有效解决了多目标组合优化问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数据驱动的交通模拟器，通过深度生成模型预测车辆轨迹，并结合交通工程指标进行评估，改进了传统规则模拟器的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的交通模拟器难以真实模拟驾驶行为，而交通交叉口在安全和效率方面至关重要，因此需要一种数据驱动的模拟方法。

Method: 提出了一种多头部自注意力轨迹预测模型，结合信号信息，并通过模拟闭环管道评估生成模型。

Result: 新模型在交通工程相关指标上优于之前的模型。

Conclusion: 研究为交通交叉口的模拟提供了数据驱动的方法和评估框架。

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通路口是城市道路网络的关键，但容易发生事故。现有模型仅关注轨迹重建误差，缺乏对交通工程特定问题的评估。

Method: 训练了一个多车辆轨迹预测模型，并在微模拟器中在线评估其性能，引入新指标评估违规行为。

Result: 尽管输入轨迹理想且重建误差低，生成的轨迹仍违反交通规则。新指标揭示了这些问题。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的评估工具和指标，以确保模型在实际交通场景中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory
reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break
traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors
and present our results.

Result: 总结了现有方法的性能和应用场景，并识别出当前研究的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了NKGs链接预测的未来研究方向，为该领域的进一步发展提供了指导。

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an
overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and
analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline
promising directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保LLMs在现实场景中的可靠部署，研究其在不确定或无法回答的问题上拒绝回答的能力至关重要。

Method: 引入AbstentionBench，一个包含20个多样化数据集的大规模基准，用于全面评估LLMs的拒绝回答能力。

Result: 评估20个前沿LLMs显示，拒绝回答仍是一个未解决的问题，且模型规模的扩大对此帮助有限；推理微调反而平均降低了24%的拒绝回答能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在拒绝回答方面存在根本性不足，需要进一步研究以提升其可靠性。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

Method: 提出VIKI-Bench基准测试和VIKI-R框架，后者通过两阶段方法（微调预训练视觉语言模型和强化学习）实现多级任务合作。

Result: VIKI-R在所有任务级别上显著优于基线方法，并展现出异构智能体间的组合合作模式。

Conclusion: VIKI-Bench和VIKI-R为视觉驱动的多智能体合作提供了统一的测试平台和方法。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Method: 基于AtCoder Heuristic Contests的真实任务，设计了一个支持长期迭代优化的软件框架，并测试了前沿LLM的表现。

Result: 前沿LLM在特定问题上表现优异，但在问题间的一致性和长期问题解决能力上仍显著落后于人类。

Conclusion: ALE-Bench有助于推动AI在算法工程领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory
production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new
benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

Motivation: 解决RAG在跨文档语义检索中表现不佳的问题，尤其是当答案需要从语义距离较远的文档中拼接时。

Method: 提出HLG三层索引结构，包括原子命题追踪、潜在主题聚类和实体关系链接。基于HLG设计了StatementGraphRAG和TopicGraphRAG两种检索器。同时开发了合成数据集生成流程。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在召回率和正确性上平均提升了23.1%。

Conclusion: HLG和配套检索器显著提升了RAG在多跳检索任务中的表现，同时合成数据集为评估提供了更复杂的环境。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Conclusion: 生成的问题具有潜力，MMR-RBO方法能有效优化问题选择。

Abstract: Existing techniques for citation recommendation are constrained by their
adherence to article contents and metadata. We leverage GPT-4o-mini's latent
expertise as an inquisitive assistant by instructing it to ask questions which,
when answered, could expose new insights about an excerpt from a scientific
article. We evaluate the utility of these questions as retrieval queries,
measuring their effectiveness in retrieving and ranking masked target
documents. In some cases, generated questions ended up being better queries
than extractive keyword queries generated by the same model. We additionally
propose MMR-RBO, a variation of Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) using
Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) to identify which questions will perform
competitively with the keyword baseline. As all question queries yield unique
result sets, we contend that there are no stupid questions.

Result: 在商业短视频平台的实验中，该方法显著提升了推荐的意外性和用户满意度。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效结合了MLLMs的优势与传统模型的效率，解决了大规模应用中的复杂性。

Abstract: Conventional recommendation systems succeed in identifying relevant content
but often fail to provide users with surprising or novel items. Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the world knowledge and multimodal
understanding needed for serendipity, but their integration into
billion-item-scale platforms presents significant challenges. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical framework where fine-tuned MLLMs provide
high-level guidance to conventional recommendation models, steering them
towards more serendipitous suggestions. This approach leverages MLLM strengths
in understanding multimodal content and user interests while retaining the
efficiency of traditional models for item-level recommendation. This mitigates
the complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also
demonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user
interests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant
yet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial
short-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our
MLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity
and user satisfaction.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统忽略属性图中的丰富信息，而现有GCN模型要么忽略属性，要么仅使用简单的三元组，无法捕捉深层语义结构。

Method: RAE通过基于规则的随机游走生成增强的属性表示，并将其整合到GCN中。

Result: 在真实数据集（BlogCatalog、Flickr）上，RAE在Recall@20和NDCG@20上平均优于基线10.6%，且对稀疏数据和缺失属性更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAE展示了利用结构化属性信息在推荐任务中的价值，显著提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: Recommendation systems often overlook the rich attribute information embedded
in property graphs, limiting their effectiveness. Existing graph convolutional
network (GCN) models either ignore attributes or rely on simplistic <user,

propose RAE (Rule- Assisted Approach for Attribute Embedding), a novel method
that improves recommendations by mining semantic rules from property graphs to
guide attribute embedding. RAE performs rule-based random walks to generate
enriched attribute representations, which are integrated into GCNs. Experiments
on real-world datasets (BlogCatalog, Flickr) show that RAE outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 10.6% on average in Recall@20 and NDCG@20. RAE
also demonstrates greater robustness to sparse data and missing attributes,

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时显著减少了上下文令牌使用和执行延迟。

Conclusion: R-Search通过结构化输出和高效优化，实现了更高效和准确的搜索增强回答。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can face factual limitations when responding to
time-sensitive queries about recent events that arise after their knowledge
thresholds in the training corpus. Existing search-augmented approaches fall
into two categories, each with distinct limitations: multi-agent search
frameworks incur substantial computational overhead by separating search
planning and response synthesis across multiple LLMs, while single-LLM
tool-calling methods restrict themselves to sequential planned, single-query
searches from sole search sources. We present Reasoning-Search (R-Search), a
single-LLM search framework that unifies multi-step planning, multi-source
search execution, and answer synthesis within one coherent inference process.
Innovatively, it structure the output into four explicitly defined components,
including reasoning steps that guide the search process (<think>), a
natural-language directed acyclic graph that represents the search plans with
respect to diverse sources (<search>), retrieved results from executing the
search plans (<result>), and synthesized final answers (<answer>). To enable
effective generation of these structured outputs, we propose a specialized
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (ReFT) method based on GRPO, together with a
multi-component reward function that optimizes LLM's answer correctness,
structural validity of the generated DAG, and adherence to the defined output
format. Experimental evaluation on FinSearchBench-24, SearchExpertBench-25, and
seven Q and A benchmarks demonstrates that R-Search outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, while achieving substantial efficiency gains through
70% reduction in context token usage and approximately 50% decrease in
execution latency. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明NAM显著优于现有基线模型，在线A/B测试中转化率提升了0.8%。

Conclusion: NAM通过结合物品视角和用户行为，有效提升了个性化搜索的准确性和转化率。

Abstract: Personalized product search provides significant benefits to e-commerce
platforms by extracting more accurate user preferences from historical
behaviors. Previous studies largely focused on the user factors when
personalizing the search query, while ignoring the item perspective, which
leads to the following two challenges that we summarize in this paper: First,
previous approaches relying only on co-occurrence frequency tend to
overestimate the conversion rates for popular items and underestimate those for
long-tail items, resulting in inaccurate item similarities; Second, user
purchasing propensity is highly heterogeneous according to the popularity of
the target item: it is less correlated with the user's historical behavior for
a popular item and more correlated for a long-tail item. To address these
challenges, in this paper we propose NAM, a Normalization Attention Model,
which optimizes ''when to personalize'' by utilizing Inverse Item Frequency
(IIF) and employing a gating mechanism, as well as optimizes ''how to
personalize'' by normalizing the attention mechanism from a global perspective.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed NAM model
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore, we
conducted an online A/B test at Fliggy, and obtained a significant improvement
of 0.8% over the latest production system in conversion rate.

TL;DR: MERIT模型通过结合商家和消费者利益，优化酒店搜索与排名系统，提升商家竞争力和服务质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线旅游平台（OTP）的搜索与排名系统主要关注平台收入，忽略了商家目标。本研究旨在通过激励循环提升商家服务质量。

Method: 提出MERIT模型，定义商家竞争力指数（MCI），设计商家塔结构建模MCI与排名关系，并采用多目标分层成对损失解决短期与长期收入冲突。

Result: 离线实验显示MERIT优于其他方法，在线A/B测试中MCI得分提升3.02%。

Conclusion: MERIT成功平衡商家与消费者利益，提升平台整体效益。

Abstract: Online Travel Platforms (OTPs) have been working on improving their hotel
Search & Ranking (S&R) systems that facilitate efficient matching between
consumers and hotels. Existing OTPs focus almost exclusively on improving
platform revenue. In this work, we take a first step in incorporating hotel
merchants' objectives into the design of hotel S&R systems to achieve an
incentive loop: the OTP tilts impressions and better-ranked positions to
merchants with high quality, and in return, the merchants provide better
service to consumers. Three critical design challenges need to be resolved to
achieve this incentive loop: Matthew Effect in the consumer feedback-loop,
unclear relation between hotel quality and performance, and conflicts between
short-term and long-term revenue. To address these challenges, we propose
MERIT, a MERchant IncenTive ranking model, which can simultaneously take the
interests of merchants and consumers into account. We define a new Merchant
Competitiveness Index (MCI) to represent hotel merchant quality and propose a
new Merchant Tower to model the relation between MCI and ranking scores. Also,
we design a monotonic structure for Merchant Tower to provide a clear relation
between hotel quality and performance. Finally, we propose a Multi-objective
Stratified Pairwise Loss, which can mitigate the conflicts between OTP's
short-term and long-term revenue. The offline experiment results indicate that
MERIT outperforms these methods in optimizing the demands of consumers and
merchants. Furthermore, we conduct an online A/B test and obtain an improvement
of 3.02% for the MCI score.

*Shigang Quan,Shui Liu,Zhenzhe Zheng,Fan Wu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TSRec的新模型，通过结合时间模式和序列模式来增强重复感知推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究重复消费行为中的时间间隔和序列关系，以更好地预测用户的重复交互意图。

Method: TSRec模型包含三个模块：用户特定时间表示模块（UTRM）、物品特定时间表示模块（ITRM）和序列重复感知模块（SRAM）。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，TSRec表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSRec通过结合时间和序列模式，有效提升了重复感知推荐的性能。

Abstract: Repeat consumption, such as repurchasing items and relistening songs, is a
common scenario in daily life. To model repeat consumption, the repeat-aware
recommendation has been proposed to predict which item will be re-interacted
based on the user-item interactions. In this paper, we investigate various
inherent characteristics to enhance the repeat-aware recommendation.
Specifically, we explore these characteristics from two aspects: one is from
the temporal aspect where we consider the time interval relationship in the
user behavior sequence; the other is from the sequential aspect where we
consider the sequential-level relationship in the user behavior sequence. And
our intuition is that both the temporal pattern and sequential pattern will
reflect users' intentions of repeat consumption. By utilizing these two
patterns, a novel model called Temporal and Sequential repeat-aware
Recommendation(TSRec for short) is proposed to enhance repeat-aware
recommendation. TSRec has three main components: 1) User-specific Temporal
Representation Module (UTRM), which encodes and extracts user historical repeat
temporal information. 2)Item-specific Temporal Representation Module (ITRM),
which incorporates item time interval information as side information to
alleviate the data sparsity problem of user repeat behavior sequence. 3)
Sequential Repeat-Aware Module (SRAM), which represents the similarity between
the user's current and the last repeat sequences. Extensive experimental
results on three public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TSRec over
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is available

Motivation: 传统Cranfield范式在捕捉用户满意度方面效果不佳，且标注成本高。研究旨在利用LLMs生成多级有用性标签，提升评估效果。

Method: 提出了一种结合用户搜索上下文和行为数据的LLM评估框架，采用级联判断结构进行多级有用性评估。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在上下文和行为信息引导下能准确评估有用性，优于第三方标注方法，且生成的标签显著提升了满意度预测模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为信息检索评估提供了更高效、准确的方法，尤其在用户满意度预测方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The conventional Cranfield paradigm struggles to effectively capture user
satisfaction due to its weak correlation between relevance and satisfaction,
alongside the high costs of relevance annotation in building test collections.
To tackle these issues, our research explores the potential of leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to generate multilevel usefulness labels for evaluation.
We introduce a new user-centric evaluation framework that integrates users'
search context and behavioral data into LLMs. This framework uses a cascading
judgment structure designed for multilevel usefulness assessments, drawing
inspiration from ordinal regression techniques. Our study demonstrates that
when well-guided with context and behavioral information, LLMs can accurately
evaluate usefulness, allowing our approach to surpass third-party labeling
methods. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the influence
of key components within the framework. We also apply the labels produced by
our method to predict user satisfaction, with real-world experiments indicating
that these labels substantially improve the performance of satisfaction
prediction models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将RDF知识图谱与GNN结合的方法，以充分利用其语义信息，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量RDF标准的知识图谱，但其丰富的语义信息在基于GNN的推荐系统中尚未被充分利用。

Method: 提出了一种综合集成RDF知识图谱与GNN的方法，利用RDF对象属性的拓扑信息和数据类型属性的内容信息。

Result: 实验表明，利用RDF知识图谱的语义丰富性显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于GNN的推荐系统在Linked Open Data云中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our
GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态检索中视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，并通过多种相似性度量方法对齐这些表示。研究发现Wasserstein距离能有效衡量模态差距，而余弦相似性在特征对齐任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态检索中，不同机器学习模型对同一概念的表示方式不同，这为跨模态特征对齐带来了挑战。

Method: 研究了视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，使用四种标准相似性度量和两种基于神经网络的学习度量进行对齐。

Result: Wasserstein距离能衡量模态差距，余弦相似性在特征对齐中表现最优，传统架构（如多层感知机）不足以捕捉复杂交互。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态信息检索提供了新见解，尤其适用于现实世界的跨模态应用。

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM查询扩展方法依赖高质量生成文档，成本高且计算量大，需改进稀疏检索性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询，生成两个排序列表并通过改进的互惠排名融合方法合并。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，与先进稀疏检索器结合达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse显著提升稀疏检索性能，展示了其在查询扩展中的优越性和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVmix是一种新型的混合精度量化方法，用于解决LLM推理中KV Cache的高内存需求问题，通过动态分配精度和优化长上下文任务，实现内存与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理中KV Cache的高内存需求限制了其在资源受限平台上的部署，现有方法无法动态优化精度分配。

Method: KVmix利用梯度重要性分析，动态分配层特定比特宽度，并引入长上下文优化策略，优先保留关键KV对的高精度。

Result: 在Llama和Mistral等LLM上，KVmix实现了近无损推理性能，内存压缩4.9倍，推理速度提升5.3倍。

Conclusion: KVmix通过动态混合精度量化和长上下文优化，显著降低了KV Cache的内存需求，同时保持了高效推理性能。

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with
satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location
coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm
creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This
methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee
observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of
localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and
national statistics. The resulting high-resolution dataset provides a
foundation for a deeper understanding of displacement drivers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域适应(PDA)问题需要对齐跨域样本并区分异常类，现有加权框架仅能表征样本级关系，对异常类的识别不够准确。

Method: 提出BUOT模型，通过样本级和类级传输的合作机制，统一表征样本和类级关系，结合标签感知传输成本确保局部传输结构。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT模型通过双层次传输框架有效解决了PDA问题，提高了知识转移的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

transfer capability
  of existing deep learning models. The framework innovatively integrates
Proper Orthogonal

pretrained LLM,
  where POD facilitates compressed representation of flow field features while
the fine-tuned model
  learns to encode system dynamics in state space. To enhance the model's
adaptability to flow field
  data, we specifically designed fluid dynamics-oriented text templates that
improve predictive
  performance through enriched contextual semantic information. Experimental
results demonstrate
  that our framework outperforms conventional Transformer models in few-shot
learning scenarios while
  exhibiting exceptional generalization across various inflow conditions and
airfoil geometries.
  Ablation studies reveal the contributions of key components in the FlowBERT
architecture. Compared
  to traditional Navier-Stokes equation solvers requiring hours of computation,
our approach reduces
  prediction time to seconds while maintaining over 90% accuracy. The developed
knowledge transfer
  paradigm establishes a new direction for rapid fluid dynamics prediction,
with potential
  applications extending to aerodynamic optimization, flow control, and other
engineering domains.

Result: 实验表明MBPO能提升LMM在视觉语言任务中的性能并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: MBPO有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Motivation: 研究如何在预训练中通过精度缩放提高GPU效率而不损失准确性，同时解决MX格式在实际应用中可能导致模型发散的问题。

Result: 成功实现了8B模型在15T tokens上的MXFP8预训练，证明了改进舍入模式的有效性。

Conclusion: 改进的舍入模式能够有效解决MX格式在预训练中的发散问题，为精度缩放技术的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV)
crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and
infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV
crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs.
Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from
Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE
automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary
graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as
nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a
coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical
Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal
adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including
semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from
crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various
graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN
(DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our
proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3
graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the
best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal
feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns
underlying AV crash severity.

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow

effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly

### [136] [Eliciting Fine-Tuned Transformer Capabilities via Inference-Time Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08060)
*Asankhaya Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明，在理想条件下，基础Transformer模型可以通过推理时技术（如上下文学习）近似监督微调的能力，无需修改模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少监督微调的计算成本，探索在推理阶段实现类似性能的方法。

Method: 在理想假设下（无限计算资源和完整数据集），通过上下文学习（ICL）近似微调能力，并扩展到有限上下文和部分数据集的实际情况。

Result: 对于文本生成和线性分类任务，给出了所需数据集大小的理论界限，证明了资源高效部署的可能性。

Conclusion: 结果为大型语言模型的高效部署提供了理论基础，实际技术（如检索增强生成）将理论与应用连接。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

*Woosung Kim,Jinho Lee,Jongmin Lee,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairDICE是首个离线多目标强化学习框架，直接优化非线性福利目标，无需显式偏好权重或穷举搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性标量化方法无法捕捉公平导向目标（如Nash社会福利或最大最小公平），离线环境下缺乏统一方法。

Method: FairDICE利用分布校正估计联合优化福利最大化和分布正则化。

Result: 在多个离线基准测试中，FairDICE表现出优于现有基线的公平感知性能。

Conclusion: FairDICE为离线MORL中的非线性福利优化提供了稳定且样本高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、快速高效的随机向量功能链接网络Lite-RVFL，无需漂移检测和重新训练即可适应概念漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据分布随时间变化（概念漂移）对在线学习方法的可靠性构成挑战，现有方法计算成本高且不适合实时应用。

Method: 引入一种新颖的目标函数，为新样本分配指数级增加的权重，强调近期数据并实现及时适应。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，Lite-RVFL能高效适应漂移并捕捉时间模式。

Conclusion: Lite-RVFL是一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，适用于实时应用中的概念漂移问题。

Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses
a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing
methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which
demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time
applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient
random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of
adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL
introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially
increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely
adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective
function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is
derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate
the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture
temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL. The source code is available at

Motivation: 解决机器学习中数据增长带来的标注和训练效率问题，避免传统方法的数据冗余和主动学习的复杂性及偏差。

Method: 提出Info-Coevolution框架，利用任务特定模型和开源模型，选择性标注并整合在线和网络数据。

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution高效优化数据集构建和训练，显著降低成本且保持性能。

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种预训练时间序列模型与传统方法在电力价格预测中的表现，发现传统方法在某些情况下仍优于新兴模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力价格预测对电力现货市场交易至关重要，但新兴生成式AI和时间序列基础模型在电力价格预测中的效果尚不确定。

Method: 使用德国、法国、荷兰、奥地利和比利时的2024年日前拍卖电力价格数据，对多种预训练模型与传统统计和机器学习方法进行基准测试。

Result: Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE在预训练模型中表现最佳，但传统方法如双季节性MSTL模型在一致性和性能上更优。

Conclusion: 尽管预训练模型表现良好，但传统方法在电力价格预测中仍具有竞争力，尤其是在捕捉季节性和一致性方面。

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

Result: 实验表明，Bingo在多个推理基准上优于基线方法，实现了准确性与效率的良好平衡。

Conclusion: Bingo展示了通过显式训练提升语言模型推理效率的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NONA的可微分k-NN回归层，通过结合神经网络注意力和学习掩码机制，提升了传统算法在监督微调中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法（如k-NN）在监督微调中表现优于神经网络，但因不可微分性难以直接集成到神经网络中。

Method: 引入NONA回归层，利用注意力机制和学习掩码模拟k-NN回归，实现可微分性。

Result: 在多个非结构化数据集上，NONA的性能优于密集层预测和传统k-NN。

Conclusion: NONA为传统算法在神经网络中的集成提供了可行方案，进一步提升了监督微调的性能。

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,
building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data
for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present
AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding
capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources,
select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

Abstract: Fairness of decision-making algorithms is an increasingly important issue. In
this paper, we focus on spectral clustering with group fairness constraints,
where every demographic group is represented in each cluster proportionally as
in the general population. We present a new efficient method for fair spectral
clustering (Fair SC) by casting the Fair SC problem within the difference of
convex functions (DC) framework. To this end, we introduce a novel variable
augmentation strategy and employ an alternating direction method of multipliers
type of algorithm adapted to DC problems. We show that each associated
subproblem can be solved efficiently, resulting in higher computational
efficiency compared to prior work, which required a computationally expensive
eigendecomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant
speedups in computation time over prior art, especially as the problem size
grows. This work thus represents a considerable step forward towards the
adoption of fair clustering in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该方法无需强假设即可识别异质材料力学特性，是传统逆方法的有效替代。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a
full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from
digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field
is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to
effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven
method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to
discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary
materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations
by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the
input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based
constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by
minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for
violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and
the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with
several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in
material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material
identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to
experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is
robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous
materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to
classical inverse methods.

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities
acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data
regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there
are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains
unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular
formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads
to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and
retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the
hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem
(which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority
over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical
structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the
lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the
upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new
formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning
(\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but
more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the
state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and
metrics. Codes are available at

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限的实际部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在处理非独立同分布数据时表现优异。

Conclusion: Federated stochastic neural networks 能有效解决联邦学习中的噪声问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that leverages edge
computing on client devices to optimize models while maintaining user privacy
by ensuring that local data remains on the device. However, since all data is
collected by clients, federated learning is susceptible to latent noise in
local datasets. Factors such as limited measurement capabilities or human
errors may introduce inaccuracies in client data. To address this challenge, we
propose the use of a stochastic neural network as the local model within the
federated learning framework. Stochastic neural networks not only facilitate
the estimation of the true underlying states of the data but also enable the
quantification of latent noise. We refer to our federated learning approach,
which incorporates stochastic neural networks as local models, as Federated
stochastic neural networks. We will present numerical experiments demonstrating
the performance and effectiveness of our method, particularly in handling
non-independent and identically distributed data.

Abstract: In recent years, with rising concerns for data privacy, Federated Learning
has gained prominence, as it enables collaborative training without the
aggregation of raw data from participating clients. However, much of the
current focus has been on parametric gradient-based models, while nonparametric
counterparts such as decision tree are relatively understudied. Existing
methods for adapting decision trees to Federated Learning generally combine a
greedy tree-building algorithm with differential privacy to produce a global
model for all clients. These methods are limited to classification trees and
categorical data due to the constraints of differential privacy. In this paper,
we explore an alternative approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm to
facilitate the construction of personalized decision trees and accommodate
categorical and numerical data, thus allowing for both classification and
regression trees. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses decision trees trained solely on local data and a benchmark
algorithm.

Conclusion: 相关噪声机制为差分隐私提供了更优的隐私-效用平衡，并在实际应用中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: This monograph explores the design and analysis of correlated noise
mechanisms for differential privacy (DP), focusing on their application to
private training of AI and machine learning models via the core primitive of
estimation of weighted prefix sums. While typical DP mechanisms inject
independent noise into each step of a stochastic gradient (SGD) learning
algorithm in order to protect the privacy of the training data, a growing body
of recent research demonstrates that introducing (anti-)correlations in the
noise can significantly improve privacy-utility trade-offs by carefully
canceling out some of the noise added on earlier steps in subsequent steps.
Such correlated noise mechanisms, known variously as matrix mechanisms,
factorization mechanisms, and DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) when
applied to learning algorithms, have also been influential in practice, with
industrial deployment at a global scale.

Abstract: Residual stresses, which remain within a component after processing, can
deteriorate performance. Accurately determining their full-field distributions
is essential for optimizing the structural integrity and longevity. However,
the experimental effort required for full-field characterization is
impractical. Given these challenges, this work proposes a machine learning (ML)
based Residual Stress Generator (RSG) to infer full-field stresses from limited
measurements. An extensive dataset was initially constructed by performing
numerous process simulations with a diverse parameter set. A ML model based on
U-Net architecture was then trained to learn the underlying structure through
systematic hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model's ability to generate
simulated stresses was evaluated, and it was ultimately tested on actual
characterization data to validate its effectiveness. The model's prediction of
simulated stresses shows that it achieved excellent predictive accuracy and
exhibited a significant degree of generalization, indicating that it
successfully learnt the latent structure of residual stress distribution. The
RSG's performance in predicting experimentally characterized data highlights
the feasibility of the proposed approach in providing a comprehensive
understanding of residual stress distributions from limited measurements,
thereby significantly reducing experimental efforts.

TL;DR: 论文研究了集成模型的可解释性问题，通过计算复杂性理论分析了影响其可解释性的因素（如基模型数量、大小和类型），发现小规模决策树集成可高效解释，而线性模型集成即使规模小也难以解释。


<details>

Motivation: 集成模型（如提升树）通常被视为黑盒，缺乏对其可解释性的严格数学理解。本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨基模型数量、大小和类型如何影响集成模型的可解释性。

Method: 应用计算复杂性理论，分析不同集成配置下生成解释的挑战，探讨基模型数量、大小和类型对解释复杂性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，在标准复杂性假设（如P≠NP）下，解释集成模型通常是难解的；小规模决策树集成可高效解释，而线性模型集成即使规模小也难以解释。

Conclusion: 通过计算复杂性视角，本文为理解集成模型的可解释性提供了更坚实的基础，强调了基模型类型和数量对解释难度的重要影响。

Abstract: Ensemble models are widely recognized in the ML community for their limited
interpretability. For instance, while a single decision tree is considered
interpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as
black-boxes. Despite this folklore recognition, there remains a lack of
rigorous mathematical understanding of what particularly makes an ensemble
(un)-interpretable, including how fundamental factors like the (1) *number*,
(2) *size*, and (3) *type* of base models influence its interpretability. In
this work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational
complexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for
various ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity
patterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under
standard complexity assumptions like P$\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains
intractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the
complexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles
of decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles
with even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe
that our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the
interpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through
a computational complexity lens.

TL;DR: Mondrian是一种基于Transformer的算子学习方法，通过将域分解为不重叠的子域并应用注意力机制，解决了高分辨率多尺度域中的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的算子模型在高分辨率和多尺度域中面临计算成本高和离散化耦合的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: Mondrian将域分解为子域，在每个子域内使用神经算子，并通过基于softmax的内积计算子域间的注意力，支持局部和全局交互。

Result: 在Allen-Cahn和Navier-Stokes PDEs上表现优异，支持分辨率扩展而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: Mondrian展示了域分解注意力在可扩展和通用神经算子中的潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning enables data-driven modeling of partial differential
equations (PDEs) by learning mappings between function spaces. However, scaling
transformer-based operator models to high-resolution, multiscale domains
remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of attention and its coupling to
discretization. We introduce \textbf{Mondrian}, transformer operators that
decompose a domain into non-overlapping subdomains and apply attention over
sequences of subdomain-restricted functions. Leveraging principles from domain
decomposition, Mondrian decouples attention from discretization. Within each
subdomain, it replaces standard layers with expressive neural operators, and
attention across subdomains is computed via softmax-based inner products over
functions. The formulation naturally extends to hierarchical windowed and
neighborhood attention, supporting both local and global interactions. Mondrian
achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, demonstrating
resolution scaling without retraining. These results highlight the promise of
domain-decomposed attention for scalable and general-purpose neural operators.

Motivation: 探索模型性能与计算预算、训练损失与评估指标的关系，以及闭环指标的重要性。

Method: 使用50万小时驾驶数据集，分析模型参数与数据规模的优化比例，并研究推理时计算效率。

Result: 模型性能随计算预算呈幂律提升，模型规模需以1.5倍于数据规模的速度增长。小模型通过采样与聚类在推理时具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 优化训练与推理的缩放特性是提升自动驾驶模型性能的关键，通用驾驶数据训练对缓解数据稀缺问题有潜力。

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM提取的RWD提供严格透明的评估方法，推动行业标准并支持AI证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Result: 在多个单源域泛化（sDG）基准测试中表现出强大的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 改进后的随机增强方法在保持低成本的同时，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution
generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of
the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its
generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is
deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random
augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the
stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding
augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic
forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization
effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong
generalization performance across various single source domain generalization
(sDG) benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了校准指标，提供了更可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM输出的可靠性，尤其在需要逐步推理的任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in
mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which
poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the
expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured
framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it
using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based
constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness
scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our
approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce
smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning
trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves
calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than
conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.

Conclusion: 提出的零参数方法简单高效，适用于多种任务，性能优越。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一种新型方法，结合超网络和区间算术，解决深度神经网络中的灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络存在灾难性遗忘和对输入扰动的脆弱性，目前没有模型能同时解决这两个问题。

Method: SHIELD通过超网络生成针对特定数据的动态网络，并使用区间算术提供严格的安全保证。

Result: SHIELD在不牺牲网络适应性的情况下增强了安全性。

Conclusion: SHIELD解决了持续学习中安全性被忽视的挑战。

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Conclusion: HC-RLHF提供了一种理论保证和实证支持的安全对齐方法，适用于敏感领域的语言模型。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Abstract: Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a
neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes
architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a
fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the
architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a
universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric
information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural
networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly
initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to
obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and
weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness
penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression
tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact
neural networks with strong performance.

Conclusion: UDE方法在分散式能源网络中电池建模可行，对实时控制和优化具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with
physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for
scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable,
and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems,
modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the
stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles.
Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture
unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn
node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a
physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and
load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural
component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from
heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth
battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains
stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of
UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy
networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and
optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature

and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously
analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy,
MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time,
and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as
Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM)
demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely
used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show
significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This
extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and
model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and
reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the
need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.

Result: ECON在六个基准测试中平均表现优于现有方法11.2%，并证明其可扩展性。

Conclusion: ECON为多智能体大语言模型提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM在主动推理上表现不佳，难以获取或利用必要信息解决问题。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要改进主动推理方法，如引入交互学习、实时反馈和环境感知目标训练。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为H$^2$GFM的新框架，旨在统一处理同质和异质文本属性图（TAGs），通过上下文编码和自适应图变换器提升图基础模型（GFM）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注同质文本属性图（HoTAGs），而忽略了异质文本属性图（HeTAGs），限制了图基础模型（GFM）的应用范围。因此，需要一种能够统一处理这两种图的模型。

Method: H$^2$GFM框架通过统一的文本空间投影多样化的元关系，并采用上下文编码捕捉空间和高阶语义关系。提出了一种上下文自适应图变换器（CGT）来生成鲁棒的节点表示，并使用CGT专家混合模型捕捉图类型的结构异质性。

Conclusion: H$^2$GFM成功扩展了GFM的能力，能够同时处理同质和异质文本属性图，为图学习领域提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains
have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across
different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing
research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the
heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on
homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple
types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and
applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to
generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse
meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a
context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To
achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph
transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context
neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT
experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types.
Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as
learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法在复杂属性图、动态拓扑和特征信息以及大规模数据上的计算效率方面存在不足，需要一种更灵活、高效的方法。

Method: 提出L-STEP模型，通过可学习的时空位置编码方案，结合MLPs的简洁性，实现高效且表达能力强的编码。

Conclusion: L-STEP是一种高效且表达能力强的时空位置编码方法，适用于动态图数据，并在多个任务中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.
Also, \name\ obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB
benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/L-STEP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially
private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in
some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular
data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the
convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's
behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a
new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify
sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive
datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces
an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein
distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original,
establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our
analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the
Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation
that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the
practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.

Result: SCUD方法在图像、文本和蛋白质数据上的表现优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: SCUD方法通过结合跳跃时间的已知分布，显著提升了离散扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate
high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a
Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual
benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising
Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,
however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,
surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we
explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes
use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov
processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed
rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in
the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show
that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any
discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete
diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking
diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate
inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that
outperform masking.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Motivation: 现有对扩散模型离散化误差的分析通常依赖复杂的概率工具，本文旨在简化这一分析过程。

Method: 利用Grönwall不等式推导收敛速率，并探索用离散随机变量（如Rademacher或均匀噪声）替代高斯噪声的可行性。

Result: 实验验证了误差按预测比例缩放，离散噪声与高斯噪声样本质量相当，且错误的噪声缩放会降低性能。

Conclusion: 本文通过简化分析和离散噪声替代，将理论严谨性与实际效率结合，推动了扩散生成模型的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models, formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), achieve state-of-the-art generative performance. However,
existing analyses of their discretization error often rely on complex
probabilistic tools. In this work, we present a simplified theoretical
framework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of
variance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs) in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPMs), where $ T $ denotes the number of denoising steps in the diffusion
process. Our approach leverages Gr\"onwall's inequality to derive a convergence
rate of $ \mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2}) $ under Lipschitz assumptions, significantly
streamlining prior proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian noise
in the discretization can be replaced by a discrete random variable (e.g.,
Rademacher or uniform noise) without sacrificing convergence guarantees-an
insight with practical implications for efficient sampling. Experiments
validate our theory, showing that (1) the error scales as predicted, (2)
discrete noise achieves comparable sample quality to Gaussian noise, and (3)
incorrect noise scaling degrades performance. By unifying simplified analysis
and discrete noise substitution, our work bridges theoretical rigor with
practical efficiency in diffusion-based generative modeling.

Motivation: 传统强化学习和动态规划方法复杂，希望通过策略参数优化实现更简单的自治系统优化。

Method: 在自治系统层面设计算法，直接优化策略参数，避免直接使用控制或动作。

Result: 算法与传统方法（如策略梯度、自然梯度等）计算结果一致，并适用于多种任务（如行为克隆、系统辨识等）。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了优化过程，适用于广泛任务，且与生成式AI模型的调优更契合。

Abstract: We develop an optimization framework centered around a core idea: once a
(parametric) policy is specified, control authority is transferred to the
policy, resulting in an autonomous dynamical system. Thus we should be able to
optimize policy parameters without further reference to controls or actions,
and without directly using the machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and
Reinforcement Learning. Here we derive simpler algorithms at the autonomous
system level, and show that they compute the same quantities as policy
gradients and Hessians, natural gradients, proximal methods. Analogs to
approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning are also available. Since
policy parameters and other system parameters are treated uniformly, the same
algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system
identification, learning of state estimators. Tuning of generative AI models is
not only possible, but is conceptually closer to the present framework than to
Reinforcement Learning.

Conclusion: 该框架为关系学习提供了严格的实体级差分隐私保证，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in
sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is
paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for
quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for
private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational
learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate
in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;
and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially
coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy
amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework
for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a
rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping
scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.
We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of
coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These
contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with
provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over
text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong
utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach. Our code is available at

approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental
results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image

it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods are computationally efficient and converge quickly,
but they often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, second-order
methods enhance convergence and generalization but typically incur high
computational and memory costs. In this work, we introduce NysAct, a scalable
first-order gradient preconditioning method that strikes a balance between
state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimization methods. NysAct
leverages an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation
covariance matrix, which is used as a preconditioning matrix, significantly
reducing time and memory complexities with minimal impact on test accuracy. Our
experiments show that NysAct not only achieves improved test accuracy compared
to both first-order and second-order methods but also demands considerably less
computational resources than existing second-order methods. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFDB的结构数据虽然覆盖广且精度高，但其几何偏差限制了在精细原子几何敏感任务（如逆折叠）中的应用。实验结构（PDB）更具多样性和物理真实性，因此需要解决AFDB的偏差问题。

Method: 作者开发了DeSAE，通过从故意损坏的骨架几何中重建自然构象，学习更稳健的结构流形。

Result: DeSAE应用于AFDB结构后，显著提升了逆折叠任务在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预测结构中细微系统偏差的重要性，并提出了去偏框架，为结构学习任务（如逆折叠）提供了性能提升的解决方案。

Abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) offers unparalleled
structural coverage at near-experimental accuracy, positioning it as a valuable
resource for data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in training
deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse
folding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural
feature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical
regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the
conformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,
PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential
for generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we
introduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct
native-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By
training the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly
captures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying
DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly
improve inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work
highlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted
structures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly
boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse
folding.

Method: 将多轮优化建模为马尔可夫决策过程，引入DPSDP算法，基于自生成数据直接偏好学习。

Result: 在MATH 500基准上，五步优化将准确率从58.2%提升至63.2%。

Conclusion: DPSDP通过多智能体协作和分布外泛化显著提升LLM推理能力。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: RLTs框架显著提升了强化学习推理的效率与可重用性，为模型蒸馏和冷启动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a
semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works
usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not
closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient
formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as
a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE),
satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy
set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on
minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on
the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up
to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to
understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.

Conclusion: 该方法为电机诊断领域提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent
diagnosis of three-phase engines has the potential to significantly enhance
diagnostic performance and accuracy. Traditional methods largely rely on
signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from
the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by
combining ML algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation
methodology that takes into account the engine physics model. We propose
Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that
synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of
healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA
creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally
intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both
supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior
diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with wide industrial application. The
findings highlight the potential of our approach to contribute significantly to
the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据重用如何在线性回归中改进现有的缩放定律，通过多轮随机梯度下降（multi-pass SGD）实现更优的测试误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决大规模语言模型训练中数据不足时缩放定律不可持续的问题。

Method: 方法包括在多轮SGD中重用数据，并假设数据协方差和真实参数具有特定的幂律谱。

Result: 结果表明，多轮SGD在数据受限情况下优于单轮SGD，测试误差更低。

Conclusion: 结论支持数据重用可以改进缩放定律，尤其在数据受限场景下。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models
trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase.
However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In
this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear
regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional
linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass
SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has
a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior
with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show
that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,
where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting,
one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see
e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse
(i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are
also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中，分布偏移导致Q值对分布外（OOD）动作的高估，现有方法因过度约束限制了Q函数泛化。

Method: 提出平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO），在CHN内通过平滑OOD Q值与邻近样本Q值来更新Q值，理论证明其能近似真实Q值。

Result: SQOG算法在D4RL基准测试中表现优于现有方法，缓解了过度约束问题，实现了接近准确的Q值估计。

Conclusion: SQOG通过增强Q函数泛化，有效解决了离线强化学习中的Q值高估问题，同时提升了性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 大规模深度学习模型的优化器性能高度依赖学习率的精细调优，传统方法需要大量网格搜索，效率低下。

Method: 提出GALA框架，动态调整学习率，利用梯度对齐和局部曲率估计，将学习率选择问题转化为一维在线学习问题。

Result: GALA在平滑非凸场景下为归一化SGD提供数据自适应收敛率，实验显示其与SGD和Adam结合时性能稳健且无需调优。

Conclusion: GALA为优化器提供了一种自适应学习率调整方法，显著减少调优需求并提升性能。

Abstract: The performance of an optimizer on large-scale deep learning models depends
critically on fine-tuning the learning rate, often requiring an extensive grid
search over base learning rates, schedules, and other hyperparameters. In this
paper, we propose a principled framework called GALA (Gradient Alignment-based
Learning rate Adaptation), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by
tracking the alignment between consecutive gradients and using a local
curvature estimate. Guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the
problem of selecting the learning rate as a one-dimensional online learning
problem. When paired with an online learning algorithm such as
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader, our method produces a flexible, adaptive
learning rate schedule that tends to increase when consecutive gradients are
aligned and decrease otherwise. We establish a data-adaptive convergence rate
for normalized SGD equipped with GALA in the smooth, nonconvex setting.
Empirically, common optimizers such as SGD and Adam, when augmented with GALA,
demonstrate robust performance across a wide range of initial learning rates
and perform competitively without the need for tuning.

Conclusion: HASFL有效解决了异构性问题，为分层联邦学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）虽能保护隐私，但梯度泄漏攻击（GLAs）的威胁引发争议。本文旨在填补这一关键空白，证明GLAs在现实环境中仍具威胁。

Method: 提出FedLeak方法，引入部分梯度匹配和梯度正则化技术，并设计基于文献和行业实践的实际评估协议。

Result: FedLeak在现实FL环境中仍能实现高保真数据重构，揭示了FL系统的重大漏洞。

Conclusion: FL系统存在显著隐私风险，亟需更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model,
where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing
private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is
non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically
misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal,
observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to
learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We
develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging
setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying
mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an
innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a
matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a
pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore
efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a
near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's
optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our
results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for
a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic
agents.

Conclusion: TAWM通过时间感知建模显著提升了模型性能和数据效率。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，MOBODY显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MOBODY通过动态模型生成数据和表示学习，有效解决了跨域动态不匹配问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

Motivation: RCSL 因其简单性和稳定性在离线强化学习中受到关注，但其性能受限于离线数据集质量，缺乏拼接能力。

Method: 提出 Reinforced RCSL 框架，引入“分布内最优未来回报”机制，避免复杂的回报增强技术。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，Reinforced RCSL 显著优于标准 RCSL。

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL 是一种简单且有效的方法，能够提升 RCSL 在离线强化学习中的性能。

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

Abstract: Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC,
exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss
landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In
this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher
information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to
activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on
their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in
a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our
knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to
the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate
attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence
property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under
which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various
network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms

Result: 实验表明，AsFT优于Safe LoRA，减少有害行为7.60%，提升模型性能3.44%。

Conclusion: AsFT能有效约束微调过程，确保模型在安全范围内运行，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during
fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise
safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction --
defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we
observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In
contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are
strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety
and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this
insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring
Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the
training objective. This term uses the alignment direction as an anchor to
suppress updates in harmful directions, ensuring that fine-tuning is
constrained within the narrow safety basin. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets show that AsFT outperforms Safe LoRA, reducing harmful behavior by
7.60 percent, improving model performance by 3.44 percent, and maintaining
robust performance across various experimental settings. Code is available at

Abstract: We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics

nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for
dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC
formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning
of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles
such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter
space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning
strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator
to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling
at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers'
equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and
significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost.
Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic

Conclusion: 该方法在保证解释形式化可靠的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为神经网络解释提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM方法（如GradCAM）仅关注单个logits，而softmax输出的概率仅依赖于logits的差异，导致CAM易受对抗性攻击（如被动欺骗）。

Method: 提出SHAMs作为对抗性基准，并设计DiffGradCAM，一种轻量级且对比性的CAM方法，能抵抗被动欺骗。

Result: SHAMs和DiffGradCAM在多类任务中验证了其有效性，DiffGradCAM在非对抗情况下与标准CAM方法一致。

Conclusion: SHAMs和DiffGradCAM为基于显著性的解释提供了新的鲁棒性评估和改进框架。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g.,
GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual
logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership
probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between
logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs
vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model
is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance.
We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an
\emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM
robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling
vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and
contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to
passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as
GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a
new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based
explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few
and many classes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在科学领域应用中准确性、泛化性和物理一致性不足的问题。

Method: 通过ML4CFD竞赛，使用OpenFOAM生成的数据集，评估模型的多方面性能。

Result: 顶级模型在综合指标上优于传统OpenFOAM求解器。

Conclusion: 竞赛结果验证了机器学习替代传统方法的潜力，并提供了未来科学ML挑战的指导。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into the physical sciences is
reshaping computational paradigms, offering the potential to accelerate
demanding simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet,
persistent challenges in accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency
hinder the practical deployment of ML models in scientific domains. To address
these limitations and systematically benchmark progress, we organized the
ML4CFD competition, centered on surrogate modeling for aerodynamic simulations
over two-dimensional airfoils. The competition attracted over 240 teams, who
were provided with a curated dataset generated via OpenFOAM and evaluated
through a multi-criteria framework encompassing predictive accuracy, physical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization.
This retrospective analysis reviews the competition outcomes, highlighting
several approaches that outperformed baselines under our global evaluation
score. Notably, the top entry exceeded the performance of the original OpenFOAM
solver on aggregate metrics, illustrating the promise of ML-based surrogates to
outperform traditional solvers under tailored criteria. Drawing from these
results, we analyze the key design principles of top submissions, assess the
robustness of our evaluation framework, and offer guidance for future
scientific ML challenges.

### [199] [Leveraging chaos in the training of artificial neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08523)
*Pedro Jiménez-González,Miguel C. Soriano,Lucas Lacasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在超常规大学习率下梯度下降（GD）优化神经网络的动态特性，发现学习率在特定范围内时，GD从纯利用型转向探索-利用平衡态，且训练时间最短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在监督学习任务中，传统优化算法（如梯度下降）的动态特性，特别是在超常规大学习率下的行为。

Method: 通过分析神经网络训练轨迹的最大Lyapunov指数，表征学习率对动态行为的影响，并在MNIST分类任务中进行验证。

Result: 发现学习率在特定范围内时，GD表现出探索-利用平衡态，且训练时间最短，这一现象在多种任务和架构中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 研究表明，瞬态混沌动态在神经网络训练中具有建设性作用，可通过定位混沌起始点加速训练。

Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted
with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational
dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the
neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning
rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD
optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime
of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of
learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions --
as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --.
Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable
accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate
region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial
neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially
illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range
of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters,
and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in
the training of artificial neural networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Evolutionary Multi-Objective Network Architecture
Search (EMNAS) for the first time to optimize neural network architectures in
large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Autonomous Driving (AD). EMNAS uses
genetic algorithms to automate network design, tailored to enhance rewards and
reduce model size without compromising performance. Additionally,
parallelization techniques are employed to accelerate the search, and
teacher-student methodologies are implemented to ensure scalable optimization.
This research underscores the potential of transfer learning as a robust
framework for optimizing performance across iterative learning processes by
effectively leveraging knowledge from earlier generations to enhance learning
efficiency and stability in subsequent generations. Experimental results

### [201] [DeepForm: Reasoning Large Language Model for Communication System Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08551)
*Panlong Wu,Ting Wang,Yifei Zhong,Haoqi Zhang,Zitong Wang,Fangxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepForm是首个专为通信系统制定设计的推理LLM，通过两阶段训练策略和专用数据集CSFRC，显著优于现有通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用LLM缺乏通信系统制定所需的专业知识和推理能力，DeepForm旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：SFT结合CoT数据提取领域知识，再通过C-ReMax强化学习算法提升推理能力。

Result: DeepForm在多种场景下表现优于大型专有LLM，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DeepForm为通信系统制定提供了高效解决方案，相关资源将开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future
wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose
models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning
capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data
required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication
system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first
reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We
propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated
for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus
(CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge;
second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based
on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated
reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly
outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release
related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is
accepted.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLMs的激活模式可用于区分答案正确性，但这种“真理几何”方法受任务限制，无法跨任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs激活模式是否能够跨任务区分答案正确性，揭示现有方法的局限性。

Method: 通过训练线性分类器分析不同任务中LLMs的激活模式，并测试其跨任务表现。

Result: 发现分类器在不同任务间相似性低，且稀疏正则化后支持集几乎不重叠，表明方法无法跨任务迁移。

Conclusion: 现有基于激活模式的“真理几何”方法受任务依赖性限制，需进一步研究更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

TL;DR: SLEEPYLAND是一个开源睡眠分期评估框架，旨在解决模型评估、泛化性、偏见和标注变异性问题。它包含大量ID和OOD数据，并发布预训练模型。SOMNUS通过集成模型在24个数据集上表现优异，超越人类评分者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床采用深度学习进行睡眠分期的障碍包括模型评估不公平、数据集泛化性差、模型偏见和人类标注变异性。

Method: 提出SLEEPYLAND框架，包含大量ID和OOD数据，并开发SOMNUS集成模型。

Result: SOMNUS在24个数据集中表现优异（F1 68.7%-87.2%），超越人类评分者，并量化了模型偏见。

Conclusion: SOMNUS通过集成提高了鲁棒性，但无法完全消除偏见；其分歧指标可预测人类不确定性。

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for automatic sleep staging, clinical
adoption remains limited due to challenges in fair model evaluation,
generalization across diverse datasets, model bias, and variability in human
annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation
framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 22'0000
hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain
(OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders,
and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA
architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single-
and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble
combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting.
SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with
macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in
94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including
cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data
as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked
to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness,
no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical
markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H,
DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on
DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus
than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA
cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and
inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with
ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了污水系统预测的准确性和可靠性，尤其在恶劣天气条件下表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning approach that harnesses the power of
generative artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of contextual
forecasting in sewerage systems. By developing a diffusion-based model that
processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex
correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions
even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we
further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting
prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target
values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage
system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable
contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather
conditions.

community. In this work, we introduce Computer Algebra with Transformer (CALT),
a user-friendly Python library designed to help non-experts in deep learning
train models for symbolic computation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBFM的新生成框架，通过显式嵌入物理约束（PDE残差和代数关系）到流匹配目标中，提升了复杂系统行为的建模精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法（如扩散模型和流匹配）通常从数据中隐式学习物理规律，缺乏对物理约束的显式嵌入。

Method: PBFM结合流匹配损失和基于物理的残差损失，无需调整权重超参数，并引入时间展开训练以提高预测精度。

Result: 在三个代表性PDE问题上，PBFM比FM的物理残差精度提升8倍，且在分布准确性上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: PBFM为物理和工程应用中的替代建模、不确定性量化和加速仿真提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CASE的高效样本选择策略，用于在上下文学习中选择最优的少样本示例，显著减少了LLM评估次数和运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在上下文学习中，少样本示例的选择对构建有效提示至关重要，但现有方法在样本复杂性和计算成本上存在挑战。

Method: 将示例选择任务建模为top-m最佳臂识别问题，提出CASE策略，通过维护“挑战者”臂短列表减少样本复杂性。

Result: CASE在运行时间上实现了7倍加速，减少了87%的LLM调用次数，且性能未受影响。

Conclusion: CASE是一种高效且实用的示例选择方法，适用于上下文学习任务。

Abstract: The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot
examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing
effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we
formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification
problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of
arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE
(Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient
selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of "challenger" arms,
which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of
the arms from this shortlist or the current topm set is pulled, thereby
reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations.
Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a
parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits
setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7x speedup in
runtime while requiring 7x fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing
performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods. We release
our code and data at https://github.com/kiranpurohit/CASE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基准假设边是非空间的简单边，忽略了物理上不同的路径，限制了图学习的几何感知能力。

Method: 通过从177TB光谱势数据中提取静态和动态Hamiltonian光谱图，构建了HSG-12M数据集，并开发了Poly2Graph开源工具。

Result: HSG-12M包含1160万静态和510万动态图，展示了多边几何学习的新挑战。

Conclusion: HSG-12M为几何感知图学习和科学发现提供了新基础，同时建立了多项式与图的通用联系。

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Motivation: 时间序列分类在医疗和工业中很重要，但公开数据集稀缺限制了时间序列基础模型（TSFM）的发展。TiViT旨在通过视觉表示解决这一问题。

Method: 将时间序列转换为图像，利用预训练的ViT模型（如OpenCLIP）提取特征，分析其2D分块对时间序列的适用性。

Result: TiViT在标准时间序列分类任务中表现最优，发现中间层高维特征最有效，且与TSFM特征空间互补。

Conclusion: TiViT展示了视觉表示在非视觉领域的复用潜力，为时间序列分类提供了新方向。

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

TL;DR: DICE框架用于解决策略诱导的稳态分布与目标分布不匹配问题，但近期改进方法削弱了其离线策略评估（OPE）能力。本文提出新方法，通过半梯度优化实现准确的成本估计和约束强化学习。


<details>

Motivation: 解决DICE框架在离线约束强化学习中因半梯度优化导致的成本估计失败问题。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过半梯度DICE实现准确的成本估计和约束强化学习。

Result: 新方法在离线约束强化学习基准DSRL上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 本文方法解决了DICE框架的局限性，实现了准确的成本估计和约束强化学习。

Abstract: Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) addresses the mismatch
between the stationary distribution induced by a policy and the target
distribution required for reliable off-policy evaluation (OPE) and policy
optimization. DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the
flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating
costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches
designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework
inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for
constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this
limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a
fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost
estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE
and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost
estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained
RL benchmark, DSRL.

TL;DR: RP-KrossFuse方法通过随机投影和Kronecker乘积整合跨模态和单模态嵌入，旨在在保留跨模态对齐的同时提升单模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态嵌入（如CLIP、BLIP）在多模态对齐中表现良好，但在单模态任务上可能不如专用嵌入；而单模态嵌入虽在各自领域表现优异，却缺乏跨模态对齐能力。因此，需要一种方法统一两者优势。

Method: 提出RP-KrossFuse方法，利用随机投影的Kronecker乘积融合跨模态和单模态嵌入，通过样本对相似性分数在核空间中高效操作，并支持可扩展实现。

Result: 实验表明，RP-KrossFuse在结合CLIP嵌入与单模态嵌入时，既能保持跨模态对齐，又在单模态任务上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: RP-KrossFuse成功弥合了跨模态与单模态嵌入之间的差距，实现了性能与对齐的双重优势。

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved
promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these
embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality
embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality
embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities.
In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and
single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert
embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment.
To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random
projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with
single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise
similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a
specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier
features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical
experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text
embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves
competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal
alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.

Motivation: Transformer在序列建模中表现出色，但如何有效融入位置信息仍是一个挑战。JoFormer旨在通过更灵活的位置表示方法解决这一问题。

Method: JoFormer利用非交换代数设计可学习的定向变换，沿输入序列逐步组合，扩展了相对位置表示方法。

Result: 在Tiny Shakespeare任务中，JoFormer比RoFormer困惑度更低、收敛更快，展示了其优势。

Conclusion: JoFormer为Transformer架构提供了一种更灵活的位置信息整合方法，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

Motivation: 探究为何简单的k-NN方法在网络流量分类中表现优于复杂神经网络。

Method: 评估k-NN基线在12个数据集和15个任务中的表现，并分析数据冗余现象。

Result: 发现数据集中超50%的冗余样本导致模型性能被高估，且标准机器学习方法可能不适用于流量分类。

Conclusion: 提出新的任务制定和评估方向，以解决数据冗余问题并优化领域实践。

Abstract: Machine learning has been applied to network traffic classification (TC) for
over two decades. While early efforts used shallow models, the latter 2010s saw
a shift toward complex neural networks, often reporting near-perfect accuracy.
However, it was recently revealed that a simple k-NN baseline using packet
sequences metadata (sizes, times, and directions) can be on par or even
outperform more complex methods. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon
further and evaluate this baseline across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, and
investigate why it performs so well. Our analysis shows that most datasets
contain over 50% redundant samples (identical packet sequences), which
frequently appear in both training and test sets due to common splitting
practices. This redundancy can lead to overestimated model performance and
reduce the theoretical maximum accuracy when identical flows have conflicting
labels. Given its distinct characteristics, we further argue that standard
machine learning practices adapted from domains like NLP or computer vision may
be ill-suited for TC. Finally, we propose new directions for task formulation
and evaluation to address these challenges and help realign the field.

*Jinkwan Jang,Hyungjin Park,Jinmyeong Choi,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChannelTokenFormer是一种基于Transformer的预测模型，旨在解决多变量时间序列数据中的通道依赖性、采样异步性和缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据通常是多变量的，且存在复杂的通道间依赖关系、采样异步性和缺失值问题，而现有模型通常基于过于简化的假设，无法应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出ChannelTokenFormer，一种灵活的Transformer架构，能够显式捕捉跨通道交互、适应通道异步采样并有效处理缺失值。

Result: 在三个修改后的基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上的实验表明，ChannelTokenFormer在具有挑战性的现实条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer为解决多变量时间序列预测中的实际问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

### [215] [Optimizing Learned Image Compression on Scalar and Entropy-Constraint Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08662)
*Florian Borzechowski,Michael Schäfer,Heiko Schwarz,Jonathan Pfaff,Detlev Marpe,Thomas Wiegand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对变分自编码器图像压缩的额外微调训练步骤，通过在推理阶段对量化潜在表示进行重新训练，提升了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练过程中难以准确模拟量化噪声，导致网络性能次优。

Method: 在传统端到端训练后，对部分网络在推理阶段的量化潜在表示上进行重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在均匀标量量化和熵约束量化中均能带来额外的编码增益，Kodak测试集平均节省1%-2%，TecNick测试集最高节省2.2%。

Conclusion: 通过正确量化数据的重新训练，可以在不增加推理复杂度的情况下提升编码效率。

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Result: 在数学（GSM8K）、编程（MBPP）和逻辑推理（BBH）任务中显著提升了SLM性能。

Conclusion: 该框架无需增加模型规模或额外训练，为资源受限环境提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide
structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle
related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template
search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring
additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution
for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该研究为公平聚类问题提供了新的解决方案，并可能对其他聚类问题产生深远影响。

Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data
analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset,
potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single
clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this
work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as
introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the
disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each
protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a
consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect
to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing
clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many
clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal
algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time
constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with
different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation
result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups.
Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest
Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems,
particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their
fair variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接对齐算法（如DPO）在训练过程中容易出现过优化问题，导致模型性能下降，因此需要一种方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种重要性采样方法（IS-DAAs），通过引入重要性比率并对其进行裁剪，以减少过优化和高方差问题。

Result: 实验表明，IS-DAAs能有效缓解过优化，尤其在低正则化强度下表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: IS-DAAs是一种有效的解决方案，能够提升直接对齐算法的性能，并公开了实现代码。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in
which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded
performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel
importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of
offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective
with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution.
IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance
sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate
over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve
better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our
implementations are provided publicly at this link.

Result: 在UK-DALE数据集上，VAE-LF在5%和10%稀疏率测试中表现优于基准模型，RMSE和MAE显著降低。

Conclusion: VAE-LF为智能电网电力负荷管理提供了高效的数据补全解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE
and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method
provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in
smart grids.

Result: 验证结果表明，基于基准的建模在碳排放估算方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: R-ICE框架为动态LLM路由和碳核算等新兴用例提供了实用方案，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市事件（如道路问题）的真实状态通常通过稀疏的政府评分和密集但有偏的众包报告观测，需要一种方法整合这两种数据以提高预测准确性。

Method: 采用多视图、多输出的GNN模型，结合政府评分和众包报告数据，预测事件的真实潜在状态。

Result: 模型在真实和半合成数据上表现优于仅使用单一数据源的模型，尤其是在评分数据稀疏时。同时揭示了众包报告中的收入偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究为利用异构、稀疏和有偏数据进行潜在状态预测提供了广泛适用的方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal
forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting,
government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like
potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street
conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection
ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of
neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via
crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to
heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a
multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and
biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we
investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect,
standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced
reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139
types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that
our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only
reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data
is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic
biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report
problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach
for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.

Result: 为具有结构化和依赖性随机性的现代神经网络提供了严格的谱稳定性保证。

Conclusion: 扩展了初始化方案的理论基础，适用于更广泛的网络模型。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to suffer from exploding or vanishing
gradients as depth increases, a phenomenon closely tied to the spectral
behavior of the input-output Jacobian. Prior work has identified critical
initialization schemes that ensure Jacobian stability, but these analyses are
typically restricted to fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights. In this
work, we go significantly beyond these limitations: we establish a general
stability theorem for deep neural networks that accommodates sparsity (such as
that introduced by pruning) and non-i.i.d., weakly correlated weights (e.g.
induced by training). Our results rely on recent advances in random matrix
theory, and provide rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a much
broader class of network models. This extends the theoretical foundation for
initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured and dependent
randomness.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly

prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural

principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to
prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their
trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world
applicability through a series of case studies.

Abstract: Missing data imputation in tabular datasets remains a pivotal challenge in
data science and machine learning, particularly within socioeconomic research.
However, real-world socioeconomic datasets are typically subject to strict data
protection protocols, which often prohibit public sharing, even for synthetic
derivatives. This severely limits the reproducibility and accessibility of
benchmark studies in such settings. Further, there are very few publicly
available synthetic datasets. Thus, there is limited availability of benchmarks
for systematic evaluation of imputation methods on socioeconomic datasets,
whether real or synthetic. In this study, we utilize the World Bank's publicly
available synthetic dataset, Synthetic Data for an Imaginary Country, which
closely mimics a real World Bank household survey while being fully public,
enabling broad access for methodological research. With this as a starting
point, we derived the IMAGIC-500 dataset: we select a subset of 500k
individuals across approximately 100k households with 19 socioeconomic
features, designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of real-world
household surveys. This paper introduces a comprehensive missing data
imputation benchmark on IMAGIC-500 under various missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR,
MNAR) and missingness ratios (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%). Our evaluation
considers the imputation accuracy for continuous and categorical variables,
computational efficiency, and impact on downstream predictive tasks, such as
estimating educational attainment at the individual level. The results
highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical, traditional machine
learning, and deep learning imputation techniques, including recent
diffusion-based methods. The IMAGIC-500 dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate
the development of robust imputation algorithms and foster reproducible social
science research.

Motivation: 边缘计算环境中任务调度的复杂性、动态性和多目标性导致传统启发式和元启发式算法难以生成最优调度方案。

Method: 采用敏捷强化学习（aRL），结合智能探索和动作屏蔽技术，减少无关动作的随机探索，提升RL-agent的适应性和收敛速度。

Result: 实验表明，aRL在命中率和收敛速度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: aRL是一种适用于边缘计算中软实时任务调度的有效方法，能够快速适应动态环境并生成高效调度方案。

Abstract: Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing
significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing
environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential
growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and
highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the
complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and
metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating
optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to
adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of
edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been
incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions
inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant
limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time
required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale
problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and
frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study
proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs
informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the
predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and
convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the
tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments
demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking
methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the
baseline approaches.

Result: 在多个异质性数据集上的实验表明，SG-GNN达到了最先进或极具竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息引导GNN可以有效提升其在异质性数据上的表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where
connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily
and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating
alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural
attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label
homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can
be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections
between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views
increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on
these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture
that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural
graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments
on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic
characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or
highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting
structural information to guide GNNs.

mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the application of recent data imputation techniques
to enhance monitoring and management of water distribution networks using smart
water meters, based on data derived from a real-world IoT water grid monitoring
deployment. Despite the detailed data produced by such meters, data gaps due to
technical issues can significantly impact operational decisions and efficiency.
Our results, by comparing various imputation methods, such as k-Nearest

that effective data imputation can substantially enhance the quality of the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为e3的方法，通过训练LLM在推理时进行上下文探索，以提升其推理能力，特别是在超出训练预算时的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型在超出训练预算时表现不佳，无法有效利用额外计算资源。论文旨在解决这一问题，通过上下文探索实现性能的持续提升。

Method: e3方法包含三个关键要素：(1) 利用LLM在验证和生成等任务上的不对称能力进行链式操作；(2) 利用错误轨迹的“负梯度”增强探索；(3) 通过特定设计的课程学习将任务难度与训练预算耦合。

Result: e3方法训练的1.7B模型在AIME'25和HMMT'25上表现最佳，并能将训练预算扩展到2倍，同时提升了pass@1和pass@k分数。

Conclusion: e3方法通过上下文探索显著提升了LLM的推理能力，特别是在超出训练预算时的表现，为LLM推理提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Result: 在合成和医学fMRI数据实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: InfoDPCCA是一种有效的表示学习工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential
data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning
natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic
probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model
two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel
information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that
captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances
representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning
separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence.
Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly
enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between
the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce
a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic
representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual
connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on
synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool
for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is available at
https://github.com/marcusstang/InfoDPCCA.

Conclusion: SeerAttention-R是一个高效且灵活的稀疏注意力框架，适用于长解码任务，并显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically
tailored for the long decoding of reasoning models. Extended from
SeerAttention, SeerAttention-R retains the design of learning attention
sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query
pooling to accommodate auto-regressive decoding. With a lightweight plug-in
gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing
pretrained model without modifying the original parameters. We demonstrate that
SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning
accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention
block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse
decoding kernel that achieves near-theoretical speedups of up to 9x over
FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPU at 90% sparsity. Code is available at:

Motivation: 大规模预训练在机器学习中已广泛应用，但在强化学习（RL）中仍面临长期依赖的挑战。本文旨在通过建模未来状态分布和用户意图，提升RL的样本效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种意图条件流占用模型（InFOM），结合流匹配技术和潜在变量建模用户意图，以预测长期未来的状态分布。

Conclusion: InFOM通过建模未来状态和用户意图，显著提升了强化学习的预训练效果，为RL的通用基础模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种多实验方程学习方法（ME-EQL），通过插值或统一模型库，显著降低从基于代理的模拟中恢复参数的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于代理的建模（ABM）计算密集且难以解析，传统方程学习方法需大量模拟，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出两种ME-EQL方法：OAT ME-EQL（逐个参数集学习并插值）和ES ME-EQL（跨参数统一模型库）。

Result: 两种方法显著降低了参数恢复的相对误差，OAT ME-EQL在参数空间泛化性更优。

Conclusion: 多实验方程学习可提升复杂生物系统模型的泛化性和可解释性。

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding
self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and
often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive
continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive
simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In
this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by
introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns
individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,
and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library
across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field
model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with
spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the
relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT
ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings
highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to
enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex
biological systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LMDI+的新方法，用于解决现有局部特征重要性方法（如LIME和TreeSHAP）的不足，通过扩展MDI+框架实现样本特定的特征重要性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树集成模型（如随机森林）因其预测性能和计算效率在表格数据中优于深度学习模型，但其局部特征重要性方法（如LIME和TreeSHAP）依赖近似和扰动，缺乏稳定性。

Method: 提出LMDI+方法，扩展了MDI+框架，利用决策树与线性模型在节点基础上的等价性，实现样本特定的特征重要性分析。

Result: LMDI+在12个真实世界基准数据集上平均提升10%的下游任务性能，且表现出更高的稳定性。

Conclusion: LMDI+不仅优于现有方法，还支持局部可解释性用例，如识别更接近的反事实和发现同质子组。

Abstract: Tree-based ensembles such as random forests remain the go-to for tabular data
over deep learning models due to their prediction performance and computational
efficiency. These advantages have led to their widespread deployment in
high-stakes domains, where interpretability is essential for ensuring
trustworthy predictions. This has motivated the development of popular local
(i.e. sample-specific) feature importance (LFI) methods such as LIME and
TreeSHAP. However, these approaches rely on approximations that ignore the
model's internal structure and instead depend on potentially unstable
perturbations. These issues are addressed in the global setting by MDI+, a
feature importance method which exploits an equivalence between decision trees
and linear models on a transformed node basis. However, the global MDI+ scores
are not able to explain predictions when faced with heterogeneous individual
characteristics. To address this gap, we propose Local MDI+ (LMDI+), a novel
extension of the MDI+ framework to the sample specific setting. LMDI+
outperforms existing baselines LIME and TreeSHAP in identifying
instance-specific signal features, averaging a 10% improvement in downstream
task performance across twelve real-world benchmark datasets. It further
demonstrates greater stability by consistently producing similar instance-level
feature importance rankings across multiple random forest fits. Finally, LMDI+
enables local interpretability use cases, including the identification of
closer counterfactuals and the discovery of homogeneous subgroups.

Motivation: 基于分子生物学的中心法则（基因到转录再到蛋白质的信息流），研究旨在实现跨模态的直接对应。

Method: 采用三种标准融合技术：密码子级嵌入拼接、熵正则化注意力池化和跨模态多头注意力，无需额外预训练或修改基础模型。

Result: 在五个分子属性预测任务中，BioLangFusion优于单模态基线，表明简单融合预训练模型即可高效捕获多组学信息。

Conclusion: BioLangFusion展示了预训练模型简单融合在多模态分子表示中的有效性，具有低开销优势。

Abstract: We present BioLangFusion, a simple approach for integrating pre-trained DNA,
mRNA, and protein language models into unified molecular representations.
Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene
to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically
meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure
direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion
techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized
attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal
multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for
combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional
pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward
integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five
molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal
baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture
complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分解方法单一且依赖固定规则，无法挖掘潜在信息或适应复杂动态特性；Transformer模型因计算复杂度高难以有效建模长序列和复杂动态关系。

Method: KARMA引入ATCD动态提取趋势和季节性成分，HFTD进一步分解序列为频域和时域，结合多尺度KarmaBlock协调处理全局和局部信息。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，KARMA在预测准确性和计算效率上显著优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: KARMA通过动态分解和高效建模，为复杂时间序列预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key
requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex
interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition
modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on
fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the
series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the
other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle
to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to
their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to
dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a
Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series
into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with
multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local
information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets
from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms
mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational
efficiency. Code and full results are available at this repository:

Result: 实验证明主流代理在环境状态扰动下脆弱，BAT能显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BAT框架在多种情况下有效增强代理对环境状态扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Conclusion: 数据高效策略在奖励模型优化中具有潜力，为低资源RLHF应用提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data

Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular

Conclusion: 标准架构在逻辑操作的系统性表示上存在局限性，需更强的归纳偏置以支持基于规则的稳健推理。

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Motivation: 探索如何优化TabPFNv2的微调策略及其内部机制，以提升其在小规模数据集上的性能。

Method: 系统评估多种微调策略，分析微调对模型内部机制的影响，类比检索增强模型。

Result: 全微调在时间和效果上最优，微调后模型的相似性计算更准确，性能提升显著，但在某些数据集上表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 全微调是TabPFNv2的最佳实践，但其稳定性仍需改进，传统方法在某些场景下仍更优。

Abstract: Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep
learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over
traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context
learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets.
However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational
models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains
underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational
models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate
fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically
evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings
establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms
of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters
TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models.
We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after
gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of
test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more
accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows
finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately
weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction
logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on
datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost
all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning
allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with
gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and
prior methods remain better.

Motivation: 现有方法（如流匹配和薛定谔桥匹配）只能建模单一路径，无法捕捉从共同起源到多个不同结果的分支或发散演化。

Method: BranchSBM通过参数化多个时间依赖的速度场和增长过程，实现了对多终端分布的分支演化建模。

Result: BranchSBM不仅更具表达力，还能有效应用于多路径导航、细胞命运分叉和细胞响应模拟等任务。

Conclusion: BranchSBM为解决多路径分支问题提供了一种有效的新方法，扩展了生成模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target
distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches,
such as flow matching and Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn
mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path.
However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and
cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple
distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge
Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\"odinger
bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and
growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence
into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more
expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface
navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states,
and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.

Motivation: 大规模数据集训练机器学习模型计算成本高，现有数据剪枝技术需完整训练，效率低。

Method: 引入重要性分数外推框架，基于k近邻和图神经网络从少量数据中学习模式，预测全数据集样本重要性。

Result: 在2种剪枝方法、4个数据集和3种训练范式下验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 分数外推是扩展昂贵分数计算任务（如剪枝、数据归因等）的有前景方向。

Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning
techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving
model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a
full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any
efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires
training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in
this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately
predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from
this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2
state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training
paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate
that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score
calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法中，均匀采样提示效率低下，导致训练计算成本高。

Method: 提出SPEED方法，选择性采样中等难度的提示，优化梯度估计的信噪比。

Result: 实验表明，SPEED在不降低准确性的情况下，训练速度提升2到6倍。

Conclusion: SPEED无需手动调参，可无缝集成到标准RL算法中，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against
verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet
remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling.
We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty
(SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training
examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency.
Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the
gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence.
Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training
without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates
seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.

TL;DR: Edit Flows是一种非自回归模型，通过编辑操作（插入、删除、替换）实现序列生成，克服了传统非自回归模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非自回归模型在生成变长序列时表现不佳，而自回归模型虽然灵活但效率较低。Edit Flows旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过连续时间马尔可夫链建模编辑操作，并利用扩展状态空间和辅助变量进行高效训练。

Result: 在图像描述生成任务中表现优于自回归和掩码模型，在文本和代码生成任务中显著优于掩码构造方法。

Conclusion: Edit Flows提供了一种灵活且高效的序列生成方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FZOO是一种快速零阶优化器，通过减少收敛所需的前向传递次数和利用并行处理，显著提高了优化速度和内存效率，性能优于现有方法MeZO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中GPU内存瓶颈问题，同时保持优化速度。

Method: 采用批量单侧估计和自适应步长策略，结合Rademacher随机向量扰动和CUDA并行处理。

Result: FZOO在11个任务中平均比MeZO准确率提高3%，前向传递次数减少3倍；RoBERTa-large上准确率提升5.6%，前向传递减少18倍。

Conclusion: FZOO实现了单GPU高速全参数微调，为内存高效预训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可视化损失景观的方法，以补充理论分析，并引入了一种新的扩展预测场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要从理论角度分析预测模型部署后的分布变化，缺乏实际可视化工具来辅助理解。

Method: 提出了一种解耦风险可视化方法，分析模型参数和数据参数的风险景观，并扩展了预测场景以反映现实情况。

Result: 通过可视化方法揭示了兴趣点的新特性，并验证了现有算法在更现实条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 可视化方法为理论分析提供了实践补充，扩展预测场景更贴近实际应用需求。

Abstract: Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ANN表现优于现有方法，准确性和适应性显著提升。

Conclusion: ANN提供了一种可扩展、数据驱动的多智能体协作框架，结合了LLMs的协作能力和神经网络的高效灵活性。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

Result: 实验验证了任务向量在高秩映射中的局限性，并通过显著性分析和参数可视化支持了猜想。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对任务向量的理解，为基于变换器的上下文学习机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Task vectors offer a compelling mechanism for accelerating inference in
in-context learning (ICL) by distilling task-specific information into a
single, reusable representation. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain
unclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that
task vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear
combinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical
support for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge
in linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss
landscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on
representing high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our
findings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter
visualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple
ones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of
task vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in
transformer-based models.

Method: 提出DCD模型，结合Dense ASPP模块进行多尺度特征提取，并使用CBAM模块增强特征表示。

Conclusion: DCD模型为胎儿心超分割提供了一种高效解决方案，有助于减轻医生负担并提高诊断准确性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

<details>

Motivation: 传统代数分解方法（如LU或SVD）无法灵活控制矩阵分解的秩、稀疏性和条件数，因此需要一种更灵活的分解方法。

Method: 提出$D$-decomposition，形式为$A \approx P D Q$，通过交替最小化正则化Frobenius损失来计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MovieLens、MNIST、Olivetti Faces和基因表达矩阵上，尤其在稀疏性和噪声条件下，重建精度优于其他方法。

Conclusion: $D$-decomposition是一种灵活且高效的矩阵分解方法，适用于需要控制分解特性的场景。

Abstract: We introduce the $D$-decomposition, a non-orthogonal matrix factorization of
the form $A \approx P D Q$, where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, $D \in
\mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$. The
decomposition is defined variationally by minimizing a regularized Frobenius
loss, allowing control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning. Unlike algebraic
factorizations such as LU or SVD, it is computed by alternating minimization.
We establish existence and perturbation stability of the solution and show that
each update has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$. Benchmarks against truncated
SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization show improved reconstruction
accuracy on MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, and gene expression matrices,
particularly under sparsity and noise.

Motivation: 解决高维张量分解中的非凸稀疏目标问题，避免显式协方差估计和迭代放气，提升计算效率和可解释性。

Method: 通过沿每个模式展开输入张量，将子问题转化为结构化二元线性优化问题，将原始非凸稀疏目标转化为可处理的几何形式。

Result: 理论证明了几何子问题与原始SHOPCA的等价性，并推导了基于经典PCA残差的近似误差界限。算法计算复杂度为线性增长，实验验证了其在稀疏支持恢复、分类性能和图像重建中的优越性。

Conclusion: sparseGeoHOPCA在高维和不平衡数据场景中表现出鲁棒性和多功能性，为稀疏高阶主成分分析提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose sparseGeoHOPCA, a novel framework for sparse higher-order
principal component analysis (SHOPCA) that introduces a geometric perspective
to high-dimensional tensor decomposition. By unfolding the input tensor along
each mode and reformulating the resulting subproblems as structured binary
linear optimization problems, our method transforms the original nonconvex
sparse objective into a tractable geometric form. This eliminates the need for
explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation, enabling significant
gains in both computational efficiency and interpretability, particularly in
high-dimensional and unbalanced data scenarios. We theoretically establish the
equivalence between the geometric subproblems and the original SHOPCA
formulation, and derive worst-case approximation error bounds based on
classical PCA residuals, providing data-dependent performance guarantees. The
proposed algorithm achieves a total computational complexity of
$O\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} (k_n^3 + J_n k_n^2)\right)$, which scales linearly with
tensor size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sparseGeoHOPCA accurately
recovers sparse supports in synthetic settings, preserves classification
performance under 10$\times$ compression, and achieves high-quality image
reconstruction on ImageNet, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

Abstract: We introduce a continuous policy-value iteration algorithm where the
approximations of the value function of a stochastic control problem and the
optimal control are simultaneously updated through Langevin-type dynamics. This
framework applies to both the entropy-regularized relaxed control problems and
the classical control problems, with infinite horizon. We establish policy
improvement and demonstrate convergence to the optimal control under the
monotonicity condition of the Hamiltonian. By utilizing Langevin-type
stochastic differential equations for continuous updates along the policy
iteration direction, our approach enables the use of distribution sampling and
non-convex learning techniques in machine learning to optimize the value
function and identify the optimal control simultaneously.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Previous algorithms can solve convex-concave minimax problems $\min_{x \in

$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ second-order oracle calls using Newton-type

is achieved by a natural generalization of the optimal first-order method. In
this work, we show an improved upper bound of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4/7})$ by generalizing the optimal second-order
method for convex optimization to solve the convex-concave minimax problem. We
further apply a similar technique to lazy Hessian algorithms and show that our
proposed algorithm can also be seen as a second-order ``Catalyst'' framework
(Lin et al., JMLR 2018) that could accelerate any globally convergent
algorithms for solving minimax problems.

Conclusion: 该框架为利用结构信息加速优化提供了理论支持，解释了实践中观察到的性能提升。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional optimisation problems exhibit rich geometric structures
in their set of minimisers, often forming smooth manifolds due to
over-parametrisation or symmetries. When this structure is known, at least
locally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part
of the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions
naturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove
redundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we
introduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the
optimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve
curvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems
and theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis
unifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is
leveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the
empirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms.

Abstract: In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\ell_0$
pseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex
relaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity
constraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been
developed to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex
constraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed
constraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of
convergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in
sparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of
sparse optimization with extra \qw{\textit{support-preserving}} constraints
commonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative
hard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection
operator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple
alternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By
introducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,
we provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our
algorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under
the conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a
fundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of
the classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection
operator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an
elegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the
zeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art
result from de Vazelhes et. al. (2022), even in the case without additional
constraints, by allowing us to remove a non-vanishing system error present in
their work.

Result: 揭示了特定壁几何形状和缺陷分布如何调控极化反转，并将抽象奖励函数映射到物理可解释的描述符上。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于铁电域切换，还可推广到其他复杂非可微设计空间的研究。

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

Motivation: 解决显微镜数据管理中的标准化和机器学习应用不足问题，促进跨学科合作。

Method: 通过黑客松活动，结合机器学习与显微镜专家，开发标准化工作流程和工具。

Result: 生成了基准数据集和显微镜的数字孪生，相关代码已公开。

Conclusion: 黑客松活动有效促进了机器学习在显微镜领域的应用，为未来工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and
functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often
well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always
consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by
major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving
insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,
benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient
and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new
APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics
for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.
Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the
impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.
Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML
researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel
solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for
instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced
benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth
and standardized workflows. All related code is available at GitHub:

### [261] [Physics-Informed Teleconnection-Aware Transformer for Global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08049)
*Tengfei Lyu,Weijia Zhang,Hao Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TelePiT是一种新型深度学习架构，通过多尺度物理和遥相关感知提升全球S2S预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: S2S预测因大气系统的混沌动力学和多尺度复杂相互作用而具有挑战性，现有方法未能明确建模关键物理过程和遥相关。

Method: TelePiT包含三个关键组件：球谐嵌入、多尺度物理信息神经ODE和遥相关感知Transformer。

Result: TelePiT显著优于现有数据驱动方法和数值天气预报系统，例如2米温度RMSE降低57.7%。

Conclusion: TelePiT通过整合多尺度物理和遥相关建模，显著提升了S2S预测性能。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的新型集成聚合方法WWAggr，用于提升高维变化点检测（CPD）的性能，并解决了决策阈值选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度神经网络的CPD方法在复杂数据模式和常见假设失效的情况下表现不佳，而标准集成聚合方法（如平均）未能充分利用问题特性。

Method: 提出WWAggr方法，利用Wasserstein距离进行任务特定的集成聚合，适用于多种深度CPD模型。

Result: WWAggr方法在多种集成模型中表现优异，并解决了决策阈值选择的长期问题。

Conclusion: WWAggr为高维CPD提供了一种更稳健的解决方案，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Result: 实验验证了算法的优越性，样本复杂度接近理论最优。

Conclusion: 该算法在多目标优化中高效且接近最优，适用于带约束的帕累托集识别。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of identifying the Pareto Set under
feasibility constraints in a multivariate bandit setting. Specifically, given a
$K$-armed bandit with unknown means $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the
goal is to identify the set of arms whose mean is not uniformly worse than that
of another arm (i.e., not smaller for all objectives), while satisfying some
known set of linear constraints, expressing, for example, some minimal
performance on each objective. Our focus lies in fixed-confidence
identification, for which we introduce an algorithm that significantly
outperforms racing-like algorithms and the intuitive two-stage approach that
first identifies feasible arms and then their Pareto Set. We further prove an
information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for
constrained Pareto Set identification, showing that the sample complexity of
our approach is near-optimal. Our theoretical results are supported by an
extensive empirical evaluation on a series of benchmarks.

Abstract: Depth measures are powerful tools for defining level sets in emerging,
non--standard, and complex random objects such as high-dimensional multivariate
data, functional data, and random graphs. Despite their favorable theoretical
properties, the integration of depth measures into regression modeling to
provide prediction regions remains a largely underexplored area of research. To
address this gap, we propose a novel, model-free uncertainty quantification
algorithm based on conditional depth measures--specifically, conditional kernel
mean embeddings and an integrated depth measure. These new algorithms can be
used to define prediction and tolerance regions when predictors and responses
are defined in separable Hilbert spaces. The use of kernel mean embeddings
ensures faster convergence rates in prediction region estimation. To enhance
the practical utility of the algorithms with finite samples, we also introduce
a conformal prediction variant that provides marginal, non-asymptotic
guarantees for the derived prediction regions. Additionally, we establish both
conditional and unconditional consistency results, as well as fast convergence
rates in certain homoscedastic settings. We evaluate the finite--sample
performance of our model in extensive simulation studies involving various
types of functional data and traditional Euclidean scenarios. Finally, we
demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through a digital health
application related to physical activity, aiming to provide personalized
recommendations

Motivation: 类别不平衡数据在分类任务中常见，但现有方法缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究重采样后CRF的理论性质。

Method: 通过建立无限CRF的中心极限定理（CLT），提出基于重要性采样的去偏方法（IS-ICRF），并分析其方差减少效果。

Result: IS-ICRF满足以预测函数值为中心的CLT，在高不平衡情况下方差显著减少。实验验证了理论结果对Breiman随机森林的适用性。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明，在重采样数据集上训练随机森林（并进行去偏）优于直接使用原始数据，尤其在方差减少方面表现突出。

Abstract: Many classification tasks involve imbalanced data, in which a class is
largely underrepresented. Several techniques consists in creating a rebalanced
dataset on which a classifier is trained. In this paper, we study theoretically
such a procedure, when the classifier is a Centered Random Forests (CRF). We
establish a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the infinite CRF with explicit rates
and exact constant. We then prove that the CRF trained on the rebalanced
dataset exhibits a bias, which can be removed with appropriate techniques.
Based on an importance sampling (IS) approach, the resulting debiased
estimator, called IS-ICRF, satisfies a CLT centered at the prediction function
value. For high imbalance settings, we prove that the IS-ICRF estimator enjoys
a variance reduction compared to the ICRF trained on the original data.
Therefore, our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of training random
forests on a rebalanced dataset (followed by a debiasing procedure) compared to
using the original data. Our theoretical results, especially the variance rates
and the variance reduction, appear to be valid for Breiman's random forests in
our experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的算法和框架在无标签场景下有效检测概念漂移，为大规模数据集的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are being increasingly used to automate decisions in
almost every domain, and ensuring the performance of these models is crucial
for ensuring high quality machine learning enabled services. Ensuring concept
drift is detected early is thus of the highest importance. A lot of research on
concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels
of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions.
Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive
models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where
the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We
propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses
classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately
detect concept drifts. We shown empirically that under computational
constraints, our approach has better statistical power than previous known
methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new drift detection framework to model the
scenario of detecting drift (without labels) given prior detections, and show
our how our drift detection algorithm can be incorporated effectively into this
framework. We demonstrate promising performance via numerical simulations.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue

physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate

Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in
our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys,
acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic
parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power
spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of
wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic
feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for
the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that
without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct
sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of
hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as
well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which
describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic
nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our
approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample
variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification
expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although
this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of
previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to
have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due
to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying
cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have
little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of
baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these
models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all
symbolic approximations found.

Conclusion: SPBA通过多样化触发器和MGDA优化，显著提升了语音后门攻击的效果和效率。

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

Conclusion: MD-ViSCo提供了一个统一框架，无需为每项任务开发独立模型，提升了医疗监测的实用性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully

integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature

high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the

TL;DR: ACORN框架通过声音教授LLMs物理感知能力，利用物理模拟器生成训练数据，构建AQA-PHY数据集，并提出音频编码器，最终在模拟和现实任务中取得合理结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本和多模态处理中表现出色，但缺乏对现实物理现象的感知能力。

Method: 提出ACORN框架，结合物理模拟器生成数据，构建AQA-PHY数据集，并设计音频编码器连接LLMs。

Result: 在视线检测、多普勒效应估计等任务中取得合理结果。

Conclusion: ACORN为LLMs理解物理世界奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and
multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical
awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath
effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a
physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as
line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival
estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

*Or Tal,Felix Kreuk,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文对文本到音乐生成的两种常见建模范式（自回归解码和条件流匹配）进行了系统比较，揭示了各自的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到音乐生成模型的多样性使得公平评估和设计选择的影响难以确定，研究专注于建模范式的影响。

Method: 通过相同数据集、训练配置和类似架构，对比自回归解码和条件流匹配范式。

Result: 研究揭示了两种范式在生成质量、推理配置鲁棒性、可扩展性等方面的差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来文本到音乐生成系统的设计和训练提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

*Thang D. Pham,Aditya Tanikanti,Murat Keçeli*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: ChemGraph是一个基于AI的框架，用于自动化计算化学和材料科学工作流程，结合图神经网络和大型语言模型，简化复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原子模拟在化学和材料科学中至关重要，但设置和执行这些模拟需要大量专业知识和手动操作，ChemGraph旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ChemGraph利用图神经网络基础模型进行高效计算，并结合大型语言模型（LLMs）实现自然语言理解和任务规划，支持多种计算方法。

Result: 在13项基准测试中，较小的LLM模型在简单任务中表现良好，而复杂任务需要更大的模型；通过多代理框架分解任务，小模型也能在某些场景中超越大模型。

Conclusion: ChemGraph通过AI和自动化显著提升了原子模拟的效率，为复杂任务提供了灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

*Yuyang Song,Hanxu Yan,Jiale Lao,Yibo Wang,Yufei Li,Yuanchun Zhou,Jianguo Wang,Mingjie Tang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的SQL查询重写系统QUITE，解决了规则方法的局限性，通过多智能体框架和实时反馈提升重写效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规则方法在SQL查询重写中存在局限性，如难以发现新规则、无法泛化到新查询模式等，而人类专家和LLM的语义推理能力为解决这些问题提供了可能。

Method: 设计了基于有限状态机的多智能体框架，结合外部工具和实时数据库反馈；开发了重写中间件；采用提示注入技术优化执行计划。

Result: QUITE将查询执行时间减少35.8%，重写数量增加24.1%，覆盖了更多查询模式。

Conclusion: QUITE通过LLM和多智能体框架显著提升了SQL查询重写的效果和覆盖范围。

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个用于评估语言模型在表格数据中处理数据异常能力的基准测试，包含2980个表查询对，覆盖9个领域和5种数据异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在自主数据分析中的部署日益增多，但其对数据异常（如缺失值、离群值等）的识别和处理能力尚未充分研究，这些异常可能严重影响分析结论的有效性。

Method: 通过程序化扰动模拟数据异常，构建RADAR基准测试，包含多样化的表格查询对，并系统性地调整表格大小以评估模型性能。

Result: 前沿模型在无异常表格上表现良好，但在引入数据异常时性能显著下降，暴露了其在数据感知分析中的不足。

Conclusion: RADAR为提升表格推理能力提供了灵活且可扩展的资源，揭示了语言模型在数据感知分析中的关键缺陷。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

TL;DR: LEANN是一种针对资源受限设备的存储高效近似最近邻搜索索引，显著减少存储开销，同时保持搜索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地设备上支持嵌入搜索的需求增长，但传统方法存储开销过高，导致部署不切实际。

Method: LEANN结合紧凑的图结构和动态重计算策略，减少存储需求。

Result: LEANN将索引大小降至原始数据的5%以下，存储减少50倍，同时保持90%的top-3召回率，延迟低于2秒。

Conclusion: LEANN为资源受限设备提供了一种高效且实用的嵌入搜索解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding-based search is widely used in applications such as recommendation
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Recently, there is a growing demand
to support these capabilities over personal data stored locally on devices.
However, maintaining the necessary data structure associated with the
embedding-based search is often infeasible due to its high storage overhead.
For example, indexing 100 GB of raw data requires 150 to 700 GB of storage,
making local deployment impractical. Reducing this overhead while maintaining
search quality and latency becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we
present LEANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
index optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LEANN combines a
compact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation
strategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval with minimal storage overhead.
Our evaluation shows that LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original
raw data, achieving up to 50 times smaller storage than standard indexes, while
maintaining 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question
answering benchmarks.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨机构联合学习方法（FL），用于从CBCT生成合成CT（sCT），解决了数据隐私和多中心数据共享的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在图像引导放疗中存在噪声、软组织对比度低和伪影问题，导致Hounsfield单位值不可靠。现有方法受限于机构异质性和数据隐私法规。

Method: 采用条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）在三个欧洲医疗中心的数据上进行联合训练，提出FedSynthCT框架。

Result: 联合模型在多中心数据上表现出良好的泛化能力，MAE为64.38-85.90 HU，SSIM为0.882-0.922，PSNR为32.86-34.91 dB。外部验证数据集上表现相似。

Conclusion: FL方法在保护数据隐私的同时，实现了CBCT到sCT的合成，为跨机构协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for
image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise,
limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield
unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT)
generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning
(DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity,
scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent
multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region,
extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial
network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers
in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers,
with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$
HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$,
and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB.
Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable
performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR:
$33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust
generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT
synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for
developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data
sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 工程学生通常缺乏AI基础知识及其社会影响的认识，课程设计旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 课程分为三个模块（行星、社会影响、职场），由工程和人文学科教师共同授课，结合技术教学与社会讨论。

Result: 学生理解AI挑战的能力提升，包括对环境影响的认识和解决AI公平问题的能力，同时改变了对AI生活影响的看法。

Conclusion: 该课程的跨学科设计和教学方法有效提升了学生对AI的理解和社会影响的认知。

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our
lives.

Result: MLPC在测试集上最高准确率为86.46%，10折交叉验证平均准确率为79.58%，训练集准确率达99.65%。

Conclusion: 神经网络（如MLPC）在数据效率上表现优异，特征选择和可解释性方法对模型性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast
students' academic performance in a school setting. Students' data with
behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with
standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron
classifier (MLPC). MLPC obtained 86.46% maximum accuracy for test set across
all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to
validate the feature selection approach.

philosophy and core components, including open-ended question answering and
homework feedback generation. The prompts are carefully crafted to optimize
responses across different problems. The smart tutor was deployed on the
Microsoft Azure platform and is currently in use in an undergraduate circuit
analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a
large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United
States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor
collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the
course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student
feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor.
Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit
analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify
frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time
awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom
instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of text-to-video retrieval (T2VR).
Inspired by the success of late interaction techniques in text-document,
text-image, and text-video retrieval, our approach, Video-ColBERT, introduces a
simple and efficient mechanism for fine-grained similarity assessment between
queries and videos. Video-ColBERT is built upon 3 main components: a
fine-grained spatial and temporal token-wise interaction, query and visual
expansions, and a dual sigmoid loss during training. We find that this
interaction and training paradigm leads to strong individual, yet compatible,
representations for encoding video content. These representations lead to
increases in performance on common text-to-video retrieval benchmarks compared
to other bi-encoder methods.

Result: 算法平均目标配准误差为3.42 mm，结合交互提示后降至2.78 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了变形建模的效率和准确性，增强了手术导航的可靠性。

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

Motivation: 现有语义分割模型依赖高质量标注数据，但实际中地面真值常不完整或噪声多，影响模型性能。基础设施网络（如运河和道路）具有图结构特性（如可达性或连通性），可用于优化地面真值。

Method: 提出IGraSS框架，结合RGB和多模态数据（NDWI、DEM）的语义分割模块与基于图的真值优化模块。分割模块处理图像块，优化模块将网络视为图进行全局调整。

Result: 实验表明，IGraSS将不可达运河段从18%降至3%，优化后的真值显著提升运河识别效果。框架还可泛化至道路网络，应用不同图约束完成任务。

Conclusion: IGraSS是一个鲁棒框架，既能优化噪声真值，又能从遥感图像中准确映射基础设施网络，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用现代仅解码器LLM作为文本编码器在文本到图像扩散模型中的效果，发现多层级平均嵌入优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型仍使用过时的T5和CLIP作为文本编码器，研究旨在探索现代LLM的潜力。

Method: 构建标准化训练与评估流程，训练27个模型，分析12种文本编码器的嵌入提取方式、LLM变体和模型大小。

Result: 传统最后一层嵌入效果较差，多层级平均嵌入显著提升复杂提示的对齐能力，多数LLM优于T5基线。

Conclusion: 现代LLM作为文本编码器在文本到图像生成中表现更优，尤其在复杂视觉语言推理任务中。

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

TL;DR: 1D图像标记器通过高度压缩的一维序列表示图像，支持启发式标记操作实现图像编辑和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索1D图像标记器在高度压缩下的潜在表达能力及其在图像编辑和生成中的应用。

Method: 利用基于梯度的测试时优化和即插即用的损失函数（如重建或CLIP相似性）构建图像生成流程。

Result: 无需训练任何生成模型，即可实现多样化和真实的图像样本生成，适用于修复和文本引导编辑。

Conclusion: 1D图像标记器在高效压缩和潜在空间操作方面表现出强大的图像编辑和生成能力。

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage是一种音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频，尤其擅长生成人物讲话的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频的感染力依赖于音频与图像的和谐结合，但目前的方法要么忽略声音，要么局限于特定应用领域。

Method: 提出了一种统一的训练方法，基于自注意力机制，支持从头训练或利用现有权重。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，且保持了通用性。

Conclusion: Mirage为音频到视频生成提供了一种通用且高质量的方法，尤其在人物讲话场景中表现突出。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEMA的新型注意力机制，解决了传统注意力机制在计算复杂度和聚焦能力上的问题，并在图像分类任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制（如全注意力和线性注意力）在计算复杂度和聚焦能力上存在不足，限制了其在计算机视觉任务中的应用。

Method: 通过数学定义广义注意力，并基于分散特性和Mamba形式注意力，设计了SEMA机制，利用令牌定位避免分散并保持聚焦。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上的实验表明，SEMA在更大规模的图像上表现优于线性注意力和近期视觉Mamba模型。

Conclusion: SEMA是一种可扩展且高效的注意力机制替代方案，适用于大规模视觉任务。

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

*Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Step AG的自适应引导策略，通过限制分类器自由引导在前几步去噪中，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分类器自由引导方法需要两倍的计算步骤，成本高昂，且现有自适应引导方法缺乏分析和实证支持，无法通用。

Method: 提出Step AG策略，限制分类器自由引导在前几步去噪中，适用于多种扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，Step AG在图像质量和文本对齐上表现良好，计算速度提升20%至30%，且适用于不同设置和模型。

Conclusion: Step AG是一种简单通用的自适应引导策略，显著提升了效率，适用于多种扩散模型。

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

TL;DR: 研究发现，文本到图像（T2I）模型在表现多样文化背景时存在显著不足，尤其是在满足隐性和显性文化期望方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨T2I模型在文化多样性表现上的局限性，并量化其与文化期望的偏差。

Method: 引入CulturalFrames基准，涵盖10个国家、5个社会文化领域，通过人类评估和详细注释分析T2I模型的表现。

Result: T2I模型在显性和隐性文化期望上的失败率分别为68%和49%，且现有评估指标与人类判断相关性低。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I模型在文化表现上的关键缺陷，为未来开发更具文化敏感性的模型和方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索是否可以通过搜索机制从已部署的非推理模型中提取隐藏知识，而不需要额外的训练或监督。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法，通过注入子问题-子答案对，将推理过程转化为搜索问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现一致提升，MMMU-PRO上总体提升2%，其中文科领域显著提升9%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过搜索机制可以在非推理模型中诱导长推理链，为现有模型的潜力挖掘提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

TL;DR: 论文提出ASVR方法，通过自回归语义视觉重建联合学习视觉和文本模态，显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型仅对文本序列进行自回归监督，未充分利用视觉模态，导致无法处理无标注图像、遗漏视觉细节及难以表达视觉内容。

Method: 提出ASVR，在统一自回归框架中联合学习视觉和文本模态，通过自回归重建图像的语义表示而非原始外观。

Result: ASVR在多种数据规模和LLM骨干上表现优异，如LLaVA-1.5在14个多模态基准上平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 自回归重建语义表示能稳定提升多模态理解，优于原始视觉外观重建。

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is
available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在视频时序定位中存在冗余注意力和多模态对齐不足的问题，影响了定位精度。

Method: MLVTG采用MambaAligner（基于Vision Mamba块）建模时序依赖，LLMRefiner利用预训练LLM的特定层增强多模态对齐，无需微调。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和TVSum数据集上，MLVTG表现优于现有基线，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MLVTG通过双对齐策略（时序建模和语义净化）显著提升了视频时序定位的精度。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上实现最优性能，验证了其在安全关键应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: TrajFlow通过高效多模态预测和优化训练技术，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range

emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the
first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The
study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or
pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction,
multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,
and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda
prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models,
illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable
attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining,
or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for
next-generation HSI applications.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context
modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,
dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based
framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a
Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床指南基于AAA最大直径的监测策略未考虑3D形状与生长的复杂关系，可能导致标准化监测间隔不适用。个性化生长预测可优化监测。

Method: 使用SE(3)-对称变换器模型，直接在血管模型表面预测AAA生长，结合局部多物理特征。训练数据为24名患者的113次CTA扫描。

Result: 模型预测AAA生长的中位直径误差为1.18毫米，并能以93%的准确率识别患者是否在两年内需手术修复。外部验证集也表现良好。

Conclusion: 局部方向性AAA生长预测可行，可为个性化监测策略提供支持。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

Motivation: 由于空间转录组数据获取成本高，大规模数据难以获得，因此需要一种高效的方法从现有图像数据中预测基因表达。

Method: 采用对比学习框架的深度学习方法，从全切片图像预测基因表达。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了基因间相关性，还适用于小样本数据集，并在癌症组织定位中显示出潜力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based
deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from
whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets
demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%
respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene
correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our
method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker
expression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家乘积（PoE）的框架，用于在推理时整合异构模型的知识，无需训练，通过退火重要性采样（AIS）实现，在图像和视频合成任务中表现出更好的可控性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经模型在共享数据领域（如图像和视频）中具有丰富的先验知识和互补性，但如何整合来自不同来源（如视觉生成模型、视觉语言模型、图形引擎和物理模拟器等）的多样化知识仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用专家乘积（PoE）框架，通过退火重要性采样（AIS）从异构模型的乘积分布中采样，实现推理时的知识组合。

Result: 在图像和视频合成任务中表现出更好的可控性，同时提供了灵活的用户界面以指定视觉生成目标。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费方法展示了异构知识整合的实用性，为视觉生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

### [302] [Inherently Faithful Attention Maps for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08915)
*Ananthu Aniraj,Cassio F. Dantas,Dino Ienco,Diego Marcos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力的方法，通过学习的二进制注意力掩码确保只有关注的图像区域影响预测，显著提高了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文可能强烈影响物体感知，导致有偏表示，尤其是在物体出现在分布外背景时。同时，许多图像级任务需要识别相关区域，通常需要上下文。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段处理完整图像以发现物体部分和任务相关区域；第二阶段利用输入注意力掩码限制其感受野到这些区域，实现聚焦分析并过滤潜在虚假信息。两阶段联合训练，第二阶段可优化第一阶段。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提高了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过注意力掩码和两阶段框架，有效解决了上下文与物体感知之间的矛盾，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEE的统一方法，用于不完全监督的隐蔽物体分割（ISCOS），通过利用SAM生成伪标签和混合粒度特征分组模块，解决了不完全监督和物体与背景相似性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐蔽物体分割任务因不完全标注数据和物体与背景的高度相似性而极具挑战性，需要一种统一的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出SEE框架，利用SAM生成伪标签，并通过伪标签生成、存储和监督策略优化训练。同时设计混合粒度特征分组模块，提升分割一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SEE在多个ISCOS任务中达到最先进性能，并可作为即插即用的解决方案提升现有模型。

Conclusion: SEE通过统一框架和特征分组模块，有效解决了ISCOS中的不完全监督和相似性问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

*Chengchao Shen,Hourun Zhu,Gongfan Fang,Jianxin Wang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DGMR的方法，通过多样性引导的MLP压缩技术，显著减少大型视觉Transformer的参数和计算量，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型Transformer模型参数过多导致计算和内存成本高昂，研究发现MLP模块占用了大部分参数，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略，消除MLP隐藏层的冗余神经元，同时保留权重多样性以在蒸馏过程中更好地恢复性能。

Result: 实验表明，DGMR方法在多个大型视觉Transformer上实现了超过57%的参数和FLOPs减少，且性能损失极小。对于EVA-CLIP-E（4.4B），参数和FLOPs减少了71.5%，且性能无下降。

Conclusion: DGMR方法是一种高效的压缩技术，显著减少了大型视觉Transformer的资源需求，同时保持了原始性能。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

*Chenyu Lian,Hong-Yu Zhou,Dongyun Liang,Jing Qin,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALTA是一种高效的医学视觉-语言对齐方法，通过适应预训练的视觉模型，显著提升了检索和零样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模方法虽在视觉表示上表现优异，但不擅长直接跨模态匹配。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（来自掩码记录建模），仅需约8%的可训练参数和不到1/5的计算消耗，实现了高效的视觉-语言对齐。此外，整合了时间多视图放射图像输入以增强信息一致性。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅提升了视觉-语言对齐任务的性能，还促进了视觉和语言理解的改进。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dispersive Loss的简单插件式正则化方法，用于改进扩散生成模型，无需额外数据或参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展独立发展。本文旨在通过Dispersive Loss填补这一差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，通过鼓励隐藏空间中的表示分散来改进模型，无需正样本对或干扰回归采样过程。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上验证，Dispersive Loss在多种模型中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss有效连接了生成建模与表示学习，为扩散模型提供了简单而强大的正则化工具。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

Motivation: Landsat数据缺乏统一的基准测试，限制了基于Landsat的地理空间基础模型（GFM）的发展。

Method: 通过EuroSAT-L、BigEarthNet-L和LC100-L三个数据集建立基准，并评估SSL4EO-L预训练模型的表现。

Result: SSL4EO-L预训练的GFM在下游任务中表现优于ImageNet，性能提升分别为+4% OA和+5.1% mAP。

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench为Landsat基础模型提供了标准化评估方法，并验证了SSL4EO-L预训练的有效性。

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth
imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress
towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L
dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract
better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and
BigEarthNet-L.

TL;DR: StreamSplat是一个实时框架，将未校准的视频流转换为动态3D高斯泼溅表示，解决了实时处理、动态场景建模和长期稳定性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理未校准输入、动态场景建模和长期稳定性，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 提出了概率采样机制和双向变形场，分别用于静态编码和动态解码。

Result: 在静态和动态基准测试中表现优于现有方法，支持任意长度视频流的在线重建。

Conclusion: StreamSplat在重建质量和动态建模方面具有显著优势，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Fast AutoAugment的数据增强方法，显著提升了小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小目标检测性能远低于大目标，是计算机视觉中的重要挑战。

Method: 采用Fast AutoAugment快速寻找最优数据增强策略。

Result: 在DOTA数据集上实现了20%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了小目标检测中的性能退化问题。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

*Felix Wagner,Pramit Saha,Harry Anthony,J. Alison Noble,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种去中心化的OOD检测框架DIsoN，通过交换模型参数而非数据，解决了训练数据隐私和存储问题，并在医疗影像数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如医疗影像）部署ML模型时，需要检测训练数据中未见过的输入（OOD），但现有方法要么丢弃训练数据，要么假设数据集中存储，这在现实中难以实现。

Method: 提出了Isolation Network框架，通过二元分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度；进一步提出DIsoN，支持在无法共享数据的情况下通过交换模型参数进行比较。

Result: 在四个医疗影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，即在不共享数据的情况下远程安全地利用训练数据进行OOD检测。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon
acceptance at: *****

Conclusion: 扩散模型在天体物理动力学中具有潜力，未来可发展更物理感知的生成模型，以对齐机器学习与天体物理系统的动态。

Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of
dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse
prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We
introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain
assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning
process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in
real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First,
from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves
interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over
conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from
the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals
improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and
different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into
diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and
provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data
statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can
align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

Conclusion: CALL通过轻量级信息共享和世界模型的泛化能力，有效解决了多智能体强化学习中的挑战，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex
high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to
suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity}
issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed,
which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming
communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI
embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop
{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory
planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of
using \textit{CALL}.

Conclusion: Re4MPC为高自由度机器人的运动规划提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Abstract: Safety validation of autonomous driving systems is extremely challenging due
to the high risks and costs of real-world testing as well as the rarity and
diversity of potential failures. To address these challenges, we train a
denoising diffusion model to generate potential failure cases of an autonomous
vehicle given any initial traffic state. Experiments on a four-way intersection
problem show that in a variety of scenarios, the diffusion model can generate
realistic failure samples while capturing a wide variety of potential failures.
Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training
and inference with modest computing resources, and does not assume any prior
knowledge of the system under test, with applicability to safety validation for
traffic intersections.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive
technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning
paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven
significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in
their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic
environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations
and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with
deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging
differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for
uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to
new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models,
robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel
situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid
neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of
autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and
accelerate their development.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

TL;DR: FreqPolicy通过频率一致性约束提升基于生成模型的视觉运动策略的效率，支持高质量的一步动作生成，并在仿真和真实机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在机器人操作中因多步采样推理成本高而难以实时应用，且传统加速技术未考虑时间依赖性。

Method: 提出FreqPolicy，通过频率一致性约束和自适应一致性损失，有效捕捉时间结构并实现高效一步动作生成。

Result: 在3个仿真基准的53个任务中表现优于现有方法，并在真实机器人场景中实现93.5Hz的推理频率。

Conclusion: FreqPolicy在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，适用于实时机器人系统。

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: MasHost是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于自主设计多智能体系统（MAS），通过图搜索问题和概率采样机制优化智能体角色和交互，引入组件合理性作为新设计原则，并通过HRPO策略实现多目标优化。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MAS构建方法依赖人工设计的交互机制或启发式规则，限制了自主能力并引入人为偏见，需要更自主和适应性的解决方案。

Method: 将MAS构建建模为图搜索问题，通过概率采样机制联合采样智能体角色和交互，提出HRPO策略实现多目标优化。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，MasHost表现优于现有基线，验证了其有效性、效率和结构合理性。

Conclusion: MasHost是首个基于强化学习的自主MAS图构建框架，为复杂任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called
MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based
evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and
actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral
presentation skills.

Motivation: 揭示t-SNE和UMAP在可视化分析中的常见误用现象，并探究其背后的原因。

Method: 通过文献综述（114篇论文）和访谈研究，验证误用的普遍性及分析原因。

Result: 发现误用主要源于对这两种技术适用性的讨论不足。

Conclusion: 提出未来方向和具体措施，以促进降维技术的合理使用。

Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly
common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not
faithfully reflect true distances between clusters, practitioners frequently
use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. In this paper, we bring
this issue to the surface and comprehensively investigate why such misuse
occurs and how to prevent it. We conduct a literature review of 114 papers to
verify the prevalence of the misuse and analyze the reasonings behind it. We
then execute an interview study to uncover practitioners' implicit motivations
for using these techniques -- rationales often undisclosed in the literature.
Our findings indicate that misuse of t-SNE and UMAP primarily stems from
limited discourse on their appropriate use in visual analytics. We conclude by
proposing future directions and concrete action items to promote more
reasonable use of DR.

TL;DR: GradEscape是一种基于梯度的攻击方法，专门针对AI生成文本检测器，通过加权嵌入和模型参数更新实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本离散性导致的不可微计算问题，并应对检测器与攻击模型之间的分词器不匹配问题。

Method: 引入加权嵌入构造方法，结合分词器推断和模型提取技术，实现高效攻击。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型上表现优异，参数效率高，成功应用于商业检测器。

Conclusion: 揭示了训练数据中文本表达风格的差异是主要漏洞，并提出了防御策略，开源了GradEscape以促进更鲁棒的检测器开发。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理方面表现出色，但其输出的不一致性和不可预测性在安全关键领域（如访问控制）带来挑战。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）仅用自然语言提示生成配置；2）结合官方文档生成配置，并评估其准确性、一致性和可靠性。

Result: 发现当前LLMs在生成配置时存在显著问题，为改进其在访问控制系统中的应用提供了重要见解。

Conclusion: 论文强调了LLMs在安全领域的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

TL;DR: ReAgent是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理后门攻击的新型防御方法，通过检测用户指令、代理规划和执行之间的一致性来识别潜在后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在训练和微调过程中面临后门攻击的安全风险，可能导致恶意操作。

Method: ReAgent采用两级方法：执行层验证代理思维与行动的一致性；规划层通过代理重建指令的能力检查一致性。

Result: ReAgent显著降低了攻击成功率（如数据库操作任务中降低90%），优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用被攻击代理自身能力可以缓解后门风险。

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN所有权验证方法（指纹和黑盒水印）存在计算成本高、后门风险或无法传递额外信息的问题。WGLE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: WGLE基于LDDE（层间距离差异）量化节点特征与预测距离的差异，通过预定义边上的LDDE值嵌入水印信息。

Result: 在六个数据集和GNN架构上，WGLE实现了100%验证准确率、0.85%的平均保真度下降，且对抗攻击鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: WGLE是一种高效、安全的GNN水印方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.
The code is available in the repository.

Result: 防御代理通常在主机被利用后1-2个时间步内清除入侵；某些重要动作的无效性在40%-99%之间；诱饵服务可阻止高达94%的直接特权访问攻击。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了代理行为的细节，并讨论了挑战的实用性，CAGE Challenge 4已部分解决了相关问题。

Abstract: We analyze two open source deep reinforcement learning agents submitted to
the CAGE Challenge 2 cyber defense challenge, where each competitor submitted
an agent to defend a simulated network against each of several provided
rules-based attack agents. We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of
agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces
and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior
of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By
analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns
in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and
defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally
able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being
exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the
various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and
which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99%
ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding
for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant
privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge
and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.

Conclusion: LLMs具备深度符号推理能力，支持神经网络学习与形式化方法的更紧密集成，为严格的程序分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of
coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more
complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper
investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in
programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward
scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI生成代码的可持续性，发现主流工具（如ChatGPT、BARD、Copilot）生成的代码普遍不符合绿色编码实践，需进一步研究和改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具的普及，其代码的可持续性（如资源利用和环境友好性）尚未被充分研究，亟需评估其对绿色数字生态的影响。

Method: 研究分析了三种流行生成式AI工具（ChatGPT、BARD、Copilot）生成的代码，评估其是否符合可持续编码实践。

Result: 结果显示，这些工具生成的代码普遍存在非绿色行为，未遵循可持续编码规则。

Conclusion: 研究强调需深入调查并提出有效改进策略，以提升AI生成代码的可持续性。

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

TL;DR: 论文研究了代码审查中的偏差现象，提出了分类和检测方法，并证明排除偏差可提升ML模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业中的合并请求（MR）流程常偏离标准审查流程，导致分析和ML模型结果偏差，需解决此问题。

Method: 识别了七类偏差，提出了一种小样本学习检测方法，并验证了排除偏差对ML模型的影响。

Result: 偏差占MR的37.02%，检测方法准确率达91%。排除偏差后，ML模型性能提升53.33%，特征重要性显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究为优化代码审查提供了分类、检测方法和实证支持，有助于提升分析可靠性。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and
ensuring reliable insights.

3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning.
For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000
protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model
in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In
both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为复杂ML问题的二次化提供了可行方案，并展示了QA在优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization
problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA,
quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs.
However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning
(ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense
interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we
model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not
only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent
quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is
verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with
the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in
which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization
process.

Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received
substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning,
their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this
interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as
function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results
quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which
explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a
regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum
models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The
practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an
application to time series analysis.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Motivation: 现有量子机器学习方法依赖线性酉操作和共享可训练参数，限制了表达能力和可扩展性，无法与经典深度网络的多层非线性架构相比。

Method: 引入叠加参数化量子电路，通过振幅变换和后选择实现多项式激活函数，并行训练多个参数集，扩展了表示能力。

Result: 数值实验表明，在1D阶跃函数回归中，误差降低了三个数量级；在2D星形分类任务中，准确率提升至81.4%，方差降低三倍。

Conclusion: 叠加参数化量子电路为硬件高效的深度参数化量子电路提供了新途径，能够学习复杂决策边界。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data
analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and
shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit
expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear
architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised
quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum
random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed
parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised
sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions
through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic
description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are
trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden
representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical
experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a
two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error
by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline;
on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a
quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance
three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as
a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum
circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

Result: 实验表明，DCIDA的Transformer策略网络显著降低了设计误差，尤其在复杂传递函数场景下表现更优。

Conclusion: DCIDA为分布式电路逆设计提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Conclusion: CNN是更优的替代模型选择，尤其在处理输入变化时表现更稳健。

Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are
introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer
solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of
this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall
properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for
image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical
solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the
statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is
compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy.
Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters
networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable
relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures.
Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more
robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the
dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper
understanding of the model behavior.

Result: 实验表明，新模型在有限数据集上提高了准确性，且单调性并非普遍保证。

Conclusion: 新模型在保证单调性的同时，提升了泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another
alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is,
the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps
surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models,
including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the
only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be
monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable
to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding
of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we
propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion
Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that
guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from
being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models
improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with
multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved
scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term
performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF)
metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our
objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital
precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the
number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave
channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an
analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital
precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we
propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms,
followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight
the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed
approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the
specific criteria within a given scenario.

this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model
(MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission
systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial
contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative
decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy
gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the
unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning
method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward
design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating
system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus
systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively
reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in
mitigating cascade propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs使用L2损失函数在某些复杂方程中表现不稳定且不准确，需要改进。

Method: 提出KP-PINNs框架，利用RKHS范数重新定义损失函数，并使用KP方法加速计算。

Result: 理论证明KP-PINNs具有稳定性，数值实验显示其能高效求解微分方程。

Conclusion: KP-PINNs为科学计算中PINNs的稳定性和准确性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工生命系统中自发产生的生命特性，如自复制和开放演化，通过扩展Lenia模型实现更复杂的生命模拟。

Method: 提出Flow-Lenia，一种质量守恒的Lenia扩展，通过优化更新规则参数生成复杂生物行为，并嵌入模型参数以实现多物种模拟。

Result: 实验证明Flow-Lenia能生成复杂行为的空间局部化模式，并展示出进化动态。

Conclusion: Flow-Lenia为人工生命研究提供了新工具，支持复杂生命行为的模拟和进化动态分析。

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

TL;DR: 研究通过结合多种分子特征表示和AutoML技术，提高了Caco-2渗透性的预测准确性，发现3D描述符显著优于2D特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Caco-2渗透性是早期药物发现中预测口服吸收的关键指标，研究旨在提升其计算预测的准确性和效率。

Method: 系统评估了八种分子特征表示（如2D/3D描述符、结构指纹和深度学习嵌入）与AutoML技术的结合效果，使用两个数据集验证模型性能。

Result: PaDEL、Mordred和RDKit描述符表现最佳，AutoML模型CaliciBoost取得最低MAE；3D描述符比2D特征降低15.73%的MAE。

Conclusion: AutoML方法在ADMET建模中有效，为数据有限的任务提供了特征选择的实用指导。

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Protriever是一个端到端的可微分框架，通过学习检索相关同源序列并同时为目标任务训练，解决了传统MSA检索的计算成本高和局限性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的同源蛋白序列检索方法（如MSA）计算成本高，对高度分歧序列或复杂插入/删除模式效果不佳，且与下游建模目标无关。

Method: Protriever框架结合检索和任务训练，通过高效向量搜索实现快速检索。

Result: 在蛋白适应性预测任务中，Protriever性能优于基于MSA的模型，且速度快两个数量级。

Conclusion: Protriever提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，适用于不同检索策略和蛋白数据库。

Abstract: Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of
protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure
modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied
on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence
Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments.
However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with
highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and
operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce
Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve
relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When
applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog
retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector
search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly
adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time
-- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EDINET-Bench，一个开源日本金融基准数据集，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在金融任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本金融数据的稀缺性阻碍了金融分析领域的学术创新，特别是LLM的发展与评估。

Method: 通过从日本EDINET系统下载过去10年的年报，自动标注任务标签，构建EDINET-Bench数据集。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进的LLM在欺诈检测和盈利预测等任务中表现仅略优于逻辑回归。

Conclusion: LLM在金融领域的应用仍面临挑战，需领域特定适配。数据集和代码已公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is
publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效且精确的物理信息机器学习方法TS-PIELM，用于解决土壤固结分析问题，显著提升了计算效率和精度。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINN）在土壤固结分析中的精度和效率不足，需要改进以成为有竞争力的替代方案。

Method: 提出TS-PIELM框架，将固结过程分为多个时间区间，使用单层前馈极限学习机（ELM）近似解，通过求解线性方程组直接计算输出层权重。

Result: TS-PIELM在一维案例中的计算效率和精度分别提升了1000倍和100倍。

Conclusion: TS-PIELM证明了物理信息机器学习在计算岩土工程中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network
(PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil
consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning
(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine
(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into
numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in
solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network
training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme
learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in
PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and
fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are
directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly
enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient
descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is
demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared
to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the
novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for
one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence
that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU集群规模庞大，软硬件交互复杂，传统方法难以应对大规模模型训练的性能问题。

Method: PerfTracker通过细粒度分析和差分可观测性，诊断硬件和软件层面的性能问题。

Result: PerfTracker已部署在包含约10,000个GPU的生产集群中，成功诊断多种性能问题。

Conclusion: PerfTracker为大规模模型训练提供了高效的性能诊断工具。

Abstract: Troubleshooting performance problems of large model training (LMT) is
immensely challenging, due to unprecedented scales of modern GPU clusters, the
complexity of software-hardware interactions, and the data intensity of the
training process. Existing troubleshooting approaches designed for traditional
distributed systems or datacenter networks fall short and can hardly apply to
real-world training systems. In this paper, we present PerfTracker, the first
online troubleshooting system utilizing fine-grained profiling, to diagnose
performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can
diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their
interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It
scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes
runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling,
and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with
minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production
service for large-scale GPU clusters of O(10, 000) GPUs (product homepage
https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/perftracker-online-performance-analysis-diagnostic-tool).
It has been used to diagnose a variety of difficult performance issues.
