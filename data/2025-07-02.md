### [1] [Table Understanding and (Multimodal) LLMs: A Cross-Domain Case Study on Scientific vs. Non-Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00152)
*Ekaterina Borisova,Fabio Barth,Nils Feldhus,Raia Abu Ahmad,Malte Ostendorff,Pedro Ortiz Suarez,Georg Rehm,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本和多模态LLM在表格理解任务中的表现，发现其在科学表格处理中存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格是广泛使用的结构化数据表示工具，但LLM在表格数据处理方面的效率尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过跨领域和跨模态评估，比较LLM在科学与非科学表格中的表现，并分析其鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: LLM在表格模态间表现稳健，但在科学表格处理中存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在表格理解中的局限性，尤其是科学表格领域。

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

### [2] [Prompting as Scientific Inquiry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00163)
*Ari Holtzman,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提示（prompting）是研究和控制大型语言模型的主要方法，也是解锁其核心能力的关键手段，应被视为行为科学而非玄学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示在大型语言模型研究中的科学地位，反驳将其视为玄学的观点。

Method: 通过类比将大型语言模型视为复杂且不透明的生物体，提示则是行为科学的一部分。

Result: 提示是大型语言模型科学中的关键组成部分，而非次要手段。

Conclusion: 提示应被视为科学方法，是理解和控制大型语言模型的重要工具。

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

### [3] [LineRetriever: Planning-Aware Observation Reduction for Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00210)
*Imene Kerboua,Sahar Omidi Shayegan,Megh Thakkar,Xing Han Lù,Massimo Caccia,Véronique Eglin,Alexandre Aussem,Jérémy Espinas,Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LineRetriever的新方法，用于在网页导航任务中优化检索方法，以解决大语言模型在处理长上下文时的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理网页导航任务时，由于网页内容过长（如DOM或AxTree结构），常超出模型上下文限制，导致关键信息丢失，影响自适应规划能力。

Method: 提出LineRetriever，利用语言模型识别并检索与未来导航步骤最相关的观察行，而非仅依赖语义相似性。

Result: 实验表明，LineRetriever能在减少观察内容的同时，保持性能不变。

Conclusion: LineRetriever为网页导航任务中的自适应规划提供了一种有效的检索优化方法。

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

### [4] [Two-Stage Reasoning-Infused Learning: Improving Classification with LLM-Generated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00214)
*Mads Henrichsen,Rasmus Krebs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，利用LLM生成的推理增强文本分类性能，实验显示显著提升了情感分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类模型缺乏显式推理，限制了性能、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 1. 微调Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct生成推理文本；2. 利用生成的推理数据训练下游生成模型。

Result: 生成模型（输出推理和情感）比基线模型（仅输出情感）准确率提升8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: LLM生成的推理能丰富训练数据，提升下游任务性能并提供显式解释。

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

### [5] [Towards Style Alignment in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00216)
*Shreya Havaldar,Adam Stein,Eric Wong,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在风格翻译中的失败，并提出RASTA方法以改善文化差异导致的风格对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成功的沟通依赖于说话者意图与听者理解的风格一致，但文化差异常导致风格翻译失败，例如礼貌性丢失。

Method: 提出RASTA方法，利用学习的风格概念来优化LLM翻译，使其更好地传达文化沟通规范。

Result: RASTA显著改善了LLM在非西方语言中的风格翻译表现，减少了中性偏误。

Conclusion: RASTA方法有效提升了LLM在跨文化风格翻译中的对齐能力。

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

### [6] [Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00239)
*Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使经过指令调优的语言模型仍可通过线性探针解码被拒绝的有害信息，表明这些信息在表示空间中未被完全消除或重定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令调优语言模型（LMs）是否真正消除了有害信息，或仅抑制其直接表达。

Method: 使用线性探针训练在LM隐藏状态上，解码被拒绝的信息，并测试其在指令调优模型中的可解码性。

Result: 线性探针能高精度预测被拒绝信息（如国家平均IQ，Pearson相关性>0.8），且基模型探针可迁移至指令调优模型。

Conclusion: 指令调优未完全消除有害信息，这些信息仍线性可解码，并在下游任务中间接影响模型行为。

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

### [7] [The Algebraic Structure of Morphosyntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00244)
*Isabella Senturia,Matilde Marcolli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种数学模型，用于描述形态学与句法学的接口，基于Merge和强最小主义理论，通过代数操作和形态树结构实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是形式化形态学与句法学的交互，特别是在缺乏形态学内部移动的情况下，如何通过数学方法描述这种接口。

Method: 方法包括构建形态树的代数结构（magma），并通过操作数（operad）对应关系将形态学与句法学数据配对。

Result: 结果表明，形态学与句法学的接口可以通过操作数对应关系和形态学余积分解来描述，同时重新解释了分布式形态学的某些操作。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的数学模型能够灵活描述形态学与句法学的边界，为相关理论提供了新的形式化工具。

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

### [8] [EfficientXLang: Towards Improving Token Efficiency Through Cross-Lingual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00246)
*Sanchit Ahuja,Praneetha Vaddamanu,Barun Patra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，非英语语言在推理任务中更高效且保持准确性，多语言基础对模型性能有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨英语是否是最高效的推理语言，并验证多语言推理的潜力。

Method: 评估三种开源模型（DeepSeek R1、Qwen 2.5、Qwen 3）在四种数学数据集和七种语言上的表现。

Result: 非英语语言减少token使用且保持准确性，多语言能力影响改进程度。

Conclusion: 多语言推理具有潜力，强调多语言基础的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

### [9] [Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00258)
*Jie Hou,Chuxiong Wu,Lannan Luo,Qiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了不同微调方法对隐私风险的影响，发现基于提示的微调在性能相当的同时，隐私泄露风险更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练大语言模型微调过程中的隐私风险，特别是记忆化带来的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 分类流行的微调方法，并通过成员推理攻击（MIAs）评估其对记忆化的影响。

Result: 基于提示的微调在性能上与基于参数的微调相当，但对MIAs的脆弱性更低，且不受模型规模影响。

Conclusion: 基于参数的微调更容易泄露隐私信息，而基于提示的微调是更隐私保护的选项。

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

### [10] [Natural language processing for African languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00297)
*David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了低资源语言（尤其是撒哈拉以南非洲语言）在NLP中的挑战，提出通过高质量语料库和多语言预训练语言模型（PLM）提升性能，并创建了21种非洲语言的大规模标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在NLP中的代表性不足问题，特别是撒哈拉以南非洲语言，因缺乏标注数据和高质量语料库而难以评估和改进性能。

Method: 分析公开语料库的噪声，构建高质量语料库；研究多语言PLM在低资源语言中的应用；开发21种非洲语言的标注数据集；进行监督、弱监督和迁移学习的实验评估。

Result: 研究表明，语义表示的质量依赖于数据质量而非数量；多语言PLM对未见语言和低资源场景有效；开发的标注数据集填补了非洲语言在NLP研究中的空白。

Conclusion: 高质量数据和多语言PLM是提升低资源语言NLP性能的关键，非洲语言的标注数据集为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

### [11] [Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00322)
*Daking Rai,Samuel Miller,Kevin Moran,Ziyu Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在生成平衡括号等简单语法任务上仍有困难，研究发现错误源于部分不可靠组件。提出的RASteer方法通过增强可靠组件的作用显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在简单语法任务上持续出错的原因，并提出解决方案以改进模型性能。

Method: 分析模型组件（注意力头和FF神经元）的作用，发现可靠与不可靠机制并存，提出RASteer方法增强可靠组件。

Result: RASteer将平衡括号任务准确率从0%提升至约100%，并在算术推理任务中实现约20%的性能提升。

Conclusion: RASteer通过优化组件贡献有效提升模型性能，且不影响其通用编码能力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

### [12] [Modeling Data Diversity for Joint Instance and Verbalizer Selection in Cold-Start Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00330)
*Mohna Chakraborty,Adithya Kulkarni,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COLDSELECT是一种联合选择verbalizer和实例的方法，通过建模数据多样性，在冷启动场景中优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法对模板、verbalizer和少样本实例选择敏感，尤其在无标签数据的冷启动场景中。现有研究忽略了实例与verbalizer之间的依赖关系。

Method: COLDSELECT将PLM词汇和$h_{[MASK]}$嵌入映射到共享空间，通过降维和聚类实现高效多样的选择，优化最小不确定性和最大多样性。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COLDSELECT在减少不确定性和增强泛化能力方面表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: COLDSELECT通过联合优化verbalizer和实例选择，显著提升了冷启动场景下的性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

### [13] [Question Decomposition for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00355)
*Paul J. L. Ammann,Jonas Golde,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合问题分解的RAG流程，通过分解多跳问题为子问题并重新排序检索结果，显著提升了检索和回答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG在处理多跳问题时表现不佳，因为相关信息分散在多个文档中。本文旨在通过问题分解和重新排序改进检索效果。

Method: 1. 使用LLM分解原始问题为子问题；2. 为每个子问题检索相关段落；3. 合并并重新排序候选段落以提高覆盖率和精度。

Result: 在MultiHop-RAG和HotpotQA上，检索效果（MRR@10）提升36.7%，回答准确率（F1）提升11.6%。

Conclusion: 问题分解与重新排序结合是一种无需额外训练或索引的实用改进方法，显著提升了多跳问题的处理能力。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

### [14] [Gregorian melody, modality, and memory: Segmenting chant with Bayesian nonparametrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00380)
*Vojtěch Lanz,Jan Hajič jr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了格里高利圣歌的旋律分段理论（centonisation），通过无监督分层Pitman-Yor语言模型寻找最优分段，发现其在调式分类中表现优异，但结果并不完全支持传统的分段理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格里高利圣歌的旋律分段理论（centonisation）长期存在争议，但近期实证显示分段在调式分类中优于音乐理论特征。研究受圣歌记忆方式启发，探索最优无监督分段。

Method: 使用嵌套分层Pitman-Yor语言模型进行无监督分段，并模拟修士记忆过程，分析分段与记忆效率的关系。

Result: 最优分段在调式分类中达到最佳性能，且旋律的开头和结尾部分更具公式化特征。然而，分段结果与传统centonisation理论不符。

Conclusion: 尽管记忆优化的分段在调式分类中表现优异，但其结果不支持传统的centonisation理论，表明旋律构造可能更复杂。

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality

even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as

TL;DR: CAPITAL是一个因果提示框架，通过将前门调整引入思维链推理，提升隐式情感分析的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于提示的方法在隐式情感分析中因未评估因果有效性而容易受内部偏见和虚假相关性影响的问题。

Method: CAPITAL将总体因果效应分解为输入提示对推理链的影响和推理链对输出的影响，利用编码器聚类和NWGM近似进行估计，并通过对比学习对齐编码器表示与LLM推理空间。

Result: 在三个LLM上的基准测试中，CAPITAL在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，尤其在对抗条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: CAPITAL为将因果推理融入LLM提示提供了原则性方法，并展示了其在偏见感知情感推理中的优势。

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are

Result: 显著提高了语言模型与多样人群的对齐能力，并提供了具体群体间的差异分析。

Conclusion: 方法的简单性和通用性便于采用，研究结果为实际应用提供了指导，开源工作为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

Motivation: 揭示开放基准测试的潜在缺陷，以促进更稳健的语言模型评估方法。

Method: 通过微调BART、T5和GPT-2的小型变体在公开测试集上，构造作弊模型，并在HELM基准上测试其排名。

Result: 作弊模型在HELM基准上排名靠前，但实际泛化能力和实用性较差。

Conclusion: 需结合私有或动态基准测试，并重新评估当前基准测试实践，以确保语言模型评估的可靠性和真实性。

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

Motivation: 随着生成式对话搜索系统的普及，广告与信息内容的界限模糊，引发透明度和信任问题，需要一种有效管理广告的方法。

Method: 采用广告重写器和广告分类器，利用合成数据训练分类器，并通过监督微调和最佳候选选择策略优化广告插入。

Result: 实验表明，基于合成数据和课程学习的广告分类器检测性能强，分类器引导的优化显著提高了广告的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 研究为广告感知生成搜索系统和鲁棒广告分类器的开发提供了对抗性协同进化框架。

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Conclusion: Nirantar为持续学习研究提供了理想的测试平台，并揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂语义条件下的意图识别提供了一种新的结构化建模方法，验证了其稳定性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Abstract: The rise of advanced computational algorithms has opened new avenues for

is still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on
methodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling
algorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling
algorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in
topic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of
topic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with
context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic
modelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and
join the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally
intensive theory construction research.

Abstract: Hallucinations are one of the major problems of LLMs, hindering their

achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in
eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages

Conclusion: 该方法具有强通用性和可扩展性，适合复杂语义建模和多语言处理任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

Conclusion: MoR提供了一种通用解决方案，适用于多样化任务的鲁棒推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting

Result: 实验表明SAFER能精准调整安全性，且不影响通用聊天性能。

Conclusion: SAFER为高风险LLM对齐任务中的奖励模型提供了解释、审计和改进方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting
and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同语言训练的VLMs是否反映文化背景下的注意力差异（如东亚的整体性与西方的分析性）。

Method: 通过比较分析日语和英语训练的VLMs生成的图像描述。

Result: VLMs不仅学习语言结构，还再现了训练数据中的文化行为模式。

Conclusion: 文化认知可能隐式影响模型输出，VLMs表现出与人类相似的文化行为。

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

Method: 引入LitBench基准和数据集，包括人类标注的故事对比数据，用于训练Bradley-Terry和生成式奖励模型，并进行在线人类研究验证。

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet在零-shot评委中表现最佳（73%与人类一致），训练后的奖励模型达到78%准确率。

Conclusion: LitBench为创意写作系统的自动化评估和优化提供了可靠资源。

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at

Conclusion: 建议系统比较不同GenAI模型的表现，并强调实证研究和理论反思以应对知识生产模式的变化。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

Conclusion: LLM集体行为表面类似人类，但机制不同，对AI对齐和多代理设计有启示。

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可扩展的人类评估协议及其自动化近似方法，用于评估主题模型和文档聚类，解决了现有方法依赖专家标签或与人类偏好不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型和文档聚类的评估方法要么依赖难以扩展的专家标签，要么使用与人类偏好不一致的自动化指标，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 设计了一种人类评估协议，通过标注者或基于LLM的代理为文本组推断类别，并将其应用于其他文档。收集了广泛的众包标注数据，并验证了自动化代理的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，最佳的LLM代理在统计上与人类标注者无显著差异，可作为自动化评估的合理替代。

Conclusion: 提出的协议和自动化代理为评估主题模型和文档聚类提供了可扩展且符合人类偏好的解决方案。

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何使用风格计量学区分LLM生成文本与人类文本，涉及模型归属、知识产权和AI伦理问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成文本的归属问题、知识产权保护及AI伦理使用，探索风格计量学在此领域的应用。

Method: 构建基于Wikipedia的基准数据集，包含人类撰写、LLM生成、文本摘要及改写文本，使用基于树模型和风格计量特征进行分类。

Result: 多分类场景下Matthews相关系数达0.87，二分类准确率0.79至1.0，Wikipedia与GPT-4的区分准确率达0.98。

Conclusion: 研究表明，风格计量学可以有效区分特定文本类型中LLM与人类生成的文本，尤其在LLM日益复杂的背景下具有重要意义。

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在香港法律判决翻译中的潜力，解决法律术语复杂、文化差异和严格语言结构等挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体框架TransLaw，包含Translator、Annotator和Proofreader三个代理，支持可定制的LLM配置。

Result: TransLaw在语义准确性、结构连贯性和风格保真度上超越GPT-4o，但在复杂术语和风格自然度上仍不及人类专家。

Conclusion: TransLaw为法律翻译提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案，未来可进一步优化以接近人类专家水平。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.
Our platform website is available at CityUHK, and our bilingual judgment corpus
used for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学问题呈现方式隐含文化背景，现有基准如GSM8K主要基于西方规范，需评估模型对不同文化背景的适应性。

Method: 创建五个地区的文化适应GSM8K变体，结合提示变换与人工验证，评估六种不同规模的LLM在五种提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型在美国中心数据集上表现最佳，文化适应版本表现较差；具备推理能力的模型对文化差异更具韧性。

Conclusion: 深层推理能力有助于弥合数学任务中的文化呈现差异。

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

Motivation: 探讨下游任务性能是否能够通过预训练损失在小规模下的表现预测，以及线性缩放定律的适用性。

Method: 对现有下游缩放定律数据进行元分析，评估线性缩放趋势的普遍性和稳定性。

Result: 仅39%的情况下符合线性缩放定律，且实验设置的微小变化会显著影响缩放趋势。

Conclusion: 需进一步理解缩放定律成功的条件，并研究偏离线性趋势的情况，以全面建模预训练损失与下游任务性能的关系。

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid,
intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions.
Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually
annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual
nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we
introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue

MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across
diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to
ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

Motivation: 为了充分利用计算系统发育方法在认知数据中的潜力，需要复杂的模型和机器学习技术，但目前缺乏大规模的手动收集认知数据集。

Method: 通过从BabelNet自动提取数据集，生成字符矩阵，并进行系统发育推断。

Result: 提取的数据集生成的系统发育树与金标准树不一致，且其他多语言资源也难以提供更合适的字符矩阵。

Conclusion: 当前无法为认知数据生成足够大的数据集，因此计算系统发育方法在历史语言学中的应用仍是一个开放问题。

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

Result: 发现道德自我校正依赖启发式捷径，导致校正与诊断能力不一致，改进方案可缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 研究提出利用启发式数据集改进道德自我校正，并指出其在情境学习和模型规模上的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

Method: 通过大规模预训练实验（30个模型，15,000次微调评估），比较MLM和CLM的效果，并提出双阶段训练策略。

Result: MLM在多数任务中表现更好，但CLM更高效且稳定；双阶段训练策略在固定计算预算下表现最优。

Conclusion: 双阶段训练策略（先CLM后MLM）能显著提升性能，尤其适合从现有CLM模型初始化，减少计算成本。

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

Motivation: 解决GUI中视觉元素多样、空间杂乱和语言模糊性带来的挑战。

Result: 在标准GUI接地基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 模态分离与区域聚焦推理结合有效提升GUI接地性能。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，TalentMine在查询任务中达到100%准确率，远超AWS Textract的0%和40%。

Conclusion: TalentMine通过语义增强的表格表示和LLM集成，显著提升了人才管理系统的信息检索性能。

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be
extended to other optimization problems.

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN在保持高精度的同时提升了模型透明度。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

TL;DR: AdvDistill提出了一种基于奖励的数据集蒸馏框架，通过多代教师模型响应和规则验证器分配奖励，显著提升了学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法中学生模型仅模仿教师模型的分布内响应，限制了其泛化能力，尤其在推理任务中表现不佳且计算成本高。

Method: AdvDistill利用教师模型对每个提示生成多个响应，并通过规则验证器分配奖励，将这些奖励作为训练学生模型的权重。

Result: 该方法显著提升了学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 引入奖励机制的数据集蒸馏方法在提升学生模型性能方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出VoyagerVision，一种多模态模型，通过视觉反馈增强LLM在空间环境中的任务能力，扩展其开放性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过视觉输入增强大型语言模型（LLM）的空间理解能力，以扩展其任务范围和开放性潜力。

Method: 提出VoyagerVision模型，利用截图作为视觉反馈，在Minecraft中构建结构。

Result: VoyagerVision平均在50次迭代中创建2.75个独特结构，且在平坦世界中的构建单元测试成功率为50%。

Conclusion: 视觉输入显著提升了LLM的空间任务能力，VoyagerVision为开放性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂推理任务中决策过程不透明的问题，提升模型的可解释性和安全性。

Method: 采用逆向推理和元认知结构，通过注意力机制反向分析推理链，生成解释。

Result: SAGE-nano模型在推理准确性（AQUA-RAT上74.6%）和解释质量（92.1%人类偏好得分）上表现优异，接近顶级模型。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为透明AI系统开辟了新途径，填补了AI安全性、教育和科学发现中的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如行为克隆）仅复制输入输出行为，无法捕捉底层意图，导致遗留系统现代化困难。

Method: 使用强化学习代理探索输入空间，识别关键决策边界，并通过K-Means聚类和决策树提取可读规则。

Result: 在三种复杂度不同的遗留系统上验证，提取的规则准确反映了核心逻辑。

Conclusion: 该方法为遗留系统迁移提供了生成规范和测试用例的有力工具。

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

Conclusion: 研究呼吁教育实践中需制定策略，促进学生主动反思AI生成内容，以避免损害自主学习和深度认知投入。

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide
future research and address emerging VRP variants.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升非推理型语言模型（如Llama 3）的推理能力，通过结构化搜索行为训练模型。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）生成合成数据集，将搜索轨迹转化为自然语言链式思考，并通过强化学习（RL）进一步优化。

Result: 在MATH-500、AMC 2023和AIME 2024上分别实现16.0%、26.9%和20.0%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 搜索启发的训练方法为开源LLM提供了稳健的推理能力提升途径。

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Motivation: 研究数学推理能力的提升是否代表更广泛的解决问题的能力，而非仅仅是对特定任务的过拟合。

Method: 评估20多个开源推理调优模型在数学、科学问答、代理规划、编码和指令遵循等任务上的表现，并进行对比实验。

Result: 大多数在数学上表现优异的模型在其他领域表现不佳，RL调优模型比SFT调优模型具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考后训练方法，减少对SFT蒸馏数据的依赖，以提升推理模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

Conclusion: 通过引入新操作和混合框架，有效提高了SMT-NRA问题的求解效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory
of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a
two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in
local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

Method: 利用预训练的象棋动作价值网络为LLM的输出动作质量提供密集奖励，类似于知识蒸馏。

Result: 密集奖励的表现优于稀疏奖励，但所有模型的表现远低于专家水平。

Conclusion: 预训练模型对象棋的内在理解不足可能是限制因素，仅靠RL可能无法完全克服这一缺陷。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to

reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent

decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为R&R的查询重写器，通过持续预训练和专业文档学习，提升专业领域的QA系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中查询重写模型因缺乏领域知识而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 结合持续预训练和监督微调，模拟学生备考的方式学习专业文档。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了R&R在专业QA中的优越性，同时保持通用场景的良好表现。

Conclusion: R&R有效缩小了查询与文档之间的差距，推动了RAG-based QA系统在专业领域的应用。

Abstract: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based question-answering (QA) system
enhances a large language model's knowledge by retrieving relevant documents
based on user queries. Discrepancies between user queries and document
phrasings often necessitate query rewriting. However, in specialized domains,
the rewriter model may struggle due to limited domain-specific knowledge. To
resolve this, we propose the R\&R (Read the doc before Rewriting) rewriter,
which involves continual pre-training on professional documents, akin to how
students prepare for open-book exams by reviewing textbooks. Additionally, it
can be combined with supervised fine-tuning for improved results. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate that R\&R excels in professional QA across
multiple domains, effectively bridging the query-document gap, while
maintaining good performance in general scenarios, thus advancing the
application of RAG-based QA systems in specialized fields.

TL;DR: DACRS模型通过对话增强、知识引导的实体建模和对话-实体匹配三个模块，解决了对话推荐系统中的数据稀疏问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRSs）在对话中通过文本信息捕捉用户偏好，但面临对话空间大、语言多样性和物品空间长尾稀疏分布的数据稀疏问题。现有方法难以泛化到多样化的对话表达，且在严重稀疏性下学习信息丰富的物品表示。

Method: DACRS模型包含三个模块：1）对话增强模块，通过两阶段增强流程丰富对话数据；2）知识引导的实体建模模块，利用知识图谱增强实体嵌入；3）对话-实体匹配模块，通过对话引导的注意力聚合融合对话和实体嵌入。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，DACRS达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DACRS通过创新的模块设计有效解决了CRSs中的数据稀疏问题，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) capture user preference through
textual information in dialogues. However, they suffer from data sparsity on
two fronts: the dialogue space is vast and linguistically diverse, while the
item space exhibits long-tail and sparse distributions. Existing methods
struggle with (1) generalizing to varied dialogue expressions due to
underutilization of rich textual cues, and (2) learning informative item
representations under severe sparsity. To address these problems, we propose a
CRS model named DACRS. It consists of three modules, namely Dialogue
Augmentation, Knowledge-Guided Entity Modeling, and Dialogue-Entity Matching.
In the Dialogue Augmentation module, we apply a two-stage augmentation pipeline
to augment the dialogue context to enrich the data and improve
generalizability. In the Knowledge-Guided Entity Modeling, we propose a
knowledge graph (KG) based entity substitution and an entity similarity
constraint to enhance the expressiveness of entity embeddings. In the
Dialogue-Entity Matching module, we fuse the dialogue embedding with the
mentioned entity embeddings through a dialogue-guided attention aggregation to
acquire user embeddings that contain both the explicit and implicit user
preferences. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of DACRS.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MassTool是一个多任务搜索框架，通过双塔架构和查询中心图卷积网络提升工具检索精度，结合搜索式用户意图建模和自适应知识转移模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具检索方法主要优化工具表示，忽视了精确查询理解的重要性，MassTool旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双塔架构：工具使用检测塔和工具检索塔（QC-GCN），结合SUIM和AdaKT模块进行多任务学习。

Result: 实验证明MassTool显著提高了检索准确性。

Conclusion: MassTool通过双步顺序决策管道实现了精确查询理解，提升了工具检索效果。

Abstract: Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models
(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter
the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream
tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on
optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise
query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool
retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage
detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step
sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: WebANNS是一种专为浏览器设计的近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）引擎，通过WebAssembly、懒加载策略和启发式方法解决了浏览器中的计算、存储和内存问题，显著提升了查询速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI基础设施中，ANNS在检索增强生成（RAG）应用中至关重要。然而，浏览器环境中的计算限制、外部存储访问问题和内存约束使得现有解决方案无法全面应对。

Method: WebANNS利用WebAssembly突破计算瓶颈，采用懒加载策略优化外部存储数据检索，并应用启发式方法减少内存使用。

Result: 实验显示，WebANNS在99%查询延迟上比现有最优引擎提升了743.8倍，内存使用减少了39%，查询时间从10秒降至10毫秒。

Conclusion: WebANNS使浏览器中的ANNS变得实用，满足了用户可接受的延迟需求。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become vital to modern AI
infrastructure, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
applications. Numerous in-browser ANNS engines have emerged to seamlessly
integrate with popular LLM-based web applications, while addressing privacy
protection and challenges of heterogeneous device deployments. However, web
browsers present unique challenges for ANNS, including computational
limitations, external storage access issues, and memory utilization
constraints, which state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions fail to address
comprehensively.
  We propose \texttt{WebANNS}, a novel ANNS engine specifically designed for
web browsers. \texttt{WebANNS} leverages WebAssembly to overcome computational
bottlenecks, designs a lazy loading strategy to optimize data retrieval from
external storage, and applies a heuristic approach to reduce memory usage.
Experiments show that \texttt{WebANNS} is fast and memory efficient, achieving
up to $743.8\times$ improvement in 99th percentile query latency over the SOTA
engine, while reducing memory usage by up to 39\%. Note that \texttt{WebANNS}
decreases query time from 10 seconds to the 10-millisecond range in browsers,
making in-browser ANNS practical with user-acceptable latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体推荐系统研究已有25年历史，但实际应用案例极少，作者质疑学术研究中常见的假设是否与用户需求匹配。

Method: 提出重新定位研究方向，利用生成式AI助手设计更自然的群体决策环境，例如通过聊天交互的AI推荐代理。

Result: 论文呼吁改进群体推荐系统设计，以更贴近用户需求，推动实际应用。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向应结合现代AI技术，如ChatGPT，以提升群体推荐系统的实用性和采纳率。

Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design
a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of
individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were
published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate
them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite
the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group
recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in
academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group
and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue
that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not
match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in
this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI
assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we
envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members
interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the
decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a
more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of
group recommendation systems in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在复杂、多维标注任务中的有效性，填补其在主观或细粒度任务中表现的研究空白。

Method: 利用高质量多维数据集，评估LLMs在五个细粒度标注子任务中的表现，并提出基于置信度和模型分歧的HITL工作流。

Result: LLMs在主观或细粒度任务中表现不一致且敏感，HITL工作流将人力成本降低45%并提升可靠性。

Conclusion: HITL工作流为LLMs在现实标注任务中的部署提供了可扩展且高性价比的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to automate
annotation, their effectiveness in complex, nuanced, and multi-dimensional
labelling tasks remains relatively underexplored. This study focuses on
annotation for the search clarification task, leveraging a high-quality,
multi-dimensional dataset that includes five distinct fine-grained annotation
subtasks. Although LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in general settings,
our study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to replicate
human-level performance in subjective or fine-grained evaluation tasks. Through
a systematic assessment, we demonstrate that LLM predictions are often
inconsistent, poorly calibrated, and highly sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective human-in-the-loop
(HITL) workflow that uses confidence thresholds and inter-model disagreement to
selectively involve human review. Our findings show that this lightweight
intervention significantly improves annotation reliability while reducing human
effort by up to 45%, offering a relatively scalable and cost-effective yet
accurate path forward for deploying LLMs in real-world evaluation settings.

Motivation: 解决LLMRec中高推理延迟和KV Cache内存压力的问题。

Method: 通过层间注意力稀疏性反转和双注意力汇聚现象，设计EARN框架，利用早期层压缩信息到寄存器令牌。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现3.79倍加速和80.8% KV Cache减少，且精度优于通用微调方法。

Conclusion: EARN有效弥合了LLMRec的效率与效果差距，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based generative recommendation (LLMRec) has achieved
notable success, but it suffers from high inference latency due to massive
computational overhead and memory pressure of KV Cache. Existing KV Cache
reduction methods face critical limitations: cache compression offers marginal
acceleration given recommendation tasks' short decoding steps, while prompt
compression risks discarding vital interaction history. Through systematic
analysis of attention patterns in LLMRec, we uncover two pivotal insights: 1)
layer-wise attention sparsity inversion where early layers retain dense
informative patterns while later layers exhibit high redundancy, and 2) dual
attention sinks phenomenon where attention scores concentrate on both head and
tail tokens of input sequences. Motivated by these insights, we propose EARN,
an efficient inference framework that leverages the early layers to compress
information into register tokens placed at the input sequence boundaries, then
focuses solely on these tokens in the subsequent layers. Extensive experiments
on three datasets, two LLMRec methods and two LLM architectures demonstrate
EARN's superiority, achieving up to 3.79x speedup and 80.8% KV Cache reduction
with better accuracy than the general finetuning approach. Our work bridges the
efficiency-effectiveness gap in LLMRec, offering practical deployment
advantages for industrial scenarios.

Conclusion: WebArXiv为评估网络代理提供了可靠且可复现的基准，动态反射机制显著提升了代理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development
of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real
websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the
instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on
dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce
WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks
grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable
evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground
truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we
identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents
over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a
lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively
retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten
state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance
differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed
reflection strategy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在明显的精度损失问题，作者将其重新定义为信息扩散问题，并提出信息论视角的解决方案。

Method: 引入HDRAM框架，利用超令牌（hypertokens）和相位相干内存地址，结合经典纠错码、全息计算和量子启发搜索，实现高效键值操作和Grover式搜索。

Result: HDRAM显著提升了关联检索效率，且无需改变模型架构。

Conclusion: 通过经典-全息-量子启发（CHQ）原则，HDRAM为增强Transformer架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物联网环境中入侵检测的不确定性和可解释性问题，提升边缘部署中的可信度和决策透明度。

Method: 结合随机森林、XGBoost和逻辑回归，利用中性逻辑将预测置信度分解为真（T）、假（F）和不确定（I）成分，并通过全局和自适应阈值标记高不确定预测。

Result: 在IoT-CAD数据集上达到97%的准确率，误分类样本的不确定性显著高于正确分类样本（I=0.62 vs. I=0.24）。

Conclusion: 中性逻辑提升了入侵检测的准确性和可解释性，为边缘和雾计算中的可信AI提供了实用基础。

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM的训练和推理成本高昂，尤其是推理成本逐渐成为主要负担。现有方法未能全面考虑模型大小、数据集和推理标记的交互作用，导致效率不足。

Method: 引入DS3框架，将推理建模为技能图的随机遍历，并通过封闭式表达式分析不同推理策略（如CoT和ToT）的任务成功率和计算成本。

Conclusion: DS3框架深化了对训练与推理相互依赖的理论理解，为算法设计和资源分配提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了保护DNN的知识产权，需要构建不可蒸馏的DNN，即无法通过知识蒸馏（KD）方法有效复制的模型。

Method: 提出CMIM训练方法，通过联合最小化交叉熵损失和温度缩放簇的条件互信息（CMI）值，训练出不可蒸馏的DNN。

Result: 实验表明，CMIM模型对所有测试的KD方法均具有不可蒸馏性，且其预测性能优于仅使用交叉熵损失的模型。

Conclusion: CMIM方法有效实现了DNN的不可蒸馏性，同时提升了模型自身的预测性能，为知识产权保护提供了新途径。

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

Result: 实验表明ST-MTM在预测性能上优于现有掩码建模、对比学习和监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-MTM通过分解和对比学习有效捕捉时间依赖关系，提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

SWE-Bench Verified dataset introduced by OpenAI and Princeton-NLP in 2024. By
organizing GitHub issues into chronologically ordered sequences that reflect
natural repository evolution, SWE-Bench-CL enables direct evaluation of an
agent's ability to accumulate experience, transfer knowledge across tasks, and
resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a
preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual
sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented
with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized
continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting,
forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite
Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the
stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python
repositories. All code and data are publicly available at

### [77] [Vision Transformer with Adversarial Indicator Token against Adversarial Attacks in Radio Signal Classifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00015)
*Lu Zhang,Sangarapillai Lambotharan,Gan Zheng,Guisheng Liao,Xuekang Liu,Fabio Roli,Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型视觉Transformer（ViT）架构，通过引入对抗指示器（AdvI）标记来检测对抗攻击，结合对抗训练和检测机制，显著提升了对抗攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在自动调制分类中的应用易受对抗攻击影响，需开发防御策略。

Method: 引入AdvI标记的ViT架构，结合对抗训练和检测机制，统一训练时和运行时的防御。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在白盒攻击场景中优于多种竞争方法。

Conclusion: AdvI标记在ViT中有效检测对抗攻击，简化了系统架构并提升了防御性能。

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于梯度和正则化的微调方法（GRFT），通过更新权重矩阵的行或列，减少存储开销并提升参数选择效率，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大预训练模型微调需要大量计算和存储资源，现有方法如GPS虽减少训练参数但增加资源需求。

Method: GRFT方法更新权重矩阵的行或列，选择梯度平方和最高的部分，并结合正则化提升知识迁移。

Result: GRFT在FGVC和VTAB数据集上仅需更新1.22%和0.30%的参数，性能优于GPS、Adapter Tuning和LoRA。

Conclusion: GRFT高效且有效，显著减少资源需求并提升性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的理论框架，将监督微调（SFT）和偏好学习（如DPO）联系起来，揭示了SFT是隐式奖励学习的特例，并提出改进方法。

Motivation: 研究如何通过统一框架优化语言模型的后训练过程，特别是SFT和偏好学习的结合。

Method: 通过数学推导证明SFT和DPO在最优策略-奖励子空间中的关系，提出学习率降低方法和基于f-散度的替代目标。

Result: 改进方法在指令跟随任务中实现了25%的相对增益和6%的绝对胜率提升。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了LLM的理论基础，提供了改进SFT和偏好学习性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

Method: 使用von Mises-Fisher分布采样状态嵌入，并探索其最近邻动作。

Result: 理论上与B-exp具有相同的探索概率，实验验证了其在大规模推荐系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: vMF-exp是B-exp的可扩展替代方案，适用于具有超球面嵌入的大型动作集。

Abstract: This paper introduces von Mises-Fisher exploration (vMF-exp), a scalable
method for exploring large action sets in reinforcement learning problems where
hyperspherical embedding vectors represent these actions. vMF-exp involves
initially sampling a state embedding representation using a von Mises-Fisher
distribution, then exploring this representation's nearest neighbors, which
scales to virtually unlimited numbers of candidate actions. We show that, under
theoretical assumptions, vMF-exp asymptotically maintains the same probability
of exploring each action as Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp), a popular
alternative that, nonetheless, suffers from scalability issues as it requires
computing softmax values for each action. Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a
scalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with
hyperspherical embeddings. Experiments on simulated data, real-world public
data, and the successful large-scale deployment of vMF-exp on the recommender
system of a global music streaming service empirically validate the key
properties of the proposed method.

Motivation: 研究目标是减少高编码时间，同时确保编码值的正确性，并分析其对分类性能的影响。

Method: 提出了三种编码策略：ILS（独立处理每行数据）、GDS（全局映射唯一特征值）、CCVS（按类别编码唯一值）。

Result: 通过分类任务评估了编码效率、正确性、模型准确性和计算成本，分析了编码时间、精度和预测性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为优化量子启发的数据转换提供了见解，适用于经典机器学习工作流程。

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

TL;DR: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）改进马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（McMC）方法，通过生成更广泛的先验提案，提高效率和适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如KLE）需要已知协方差函数，但在实际应用中往往不可得。VAE提供了一种数据驱动的方法，灵活捕捉更广泛的相关结构。

Method: 采用VAE框架，在贝叶斯反问题（如地下水流建模）中生成先验提案，并通过合成地下水流动反演问题进行测试。

Result: VAE在已知相关长度时与KLE精度相当，在相关长度假设偏离真实值时优于KLE，同时显著降低随机维度，提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 深度生成模型在McMC方法中的应用可以提高高维贝叶斯推断的适应性和效率。

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency
and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating
broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance
function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework
enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of
correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface
flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow
inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves
comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms
KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover,
the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving
computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative
models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional problems.

Result: 实验表明，AIMatDesign在发现效率、收敛速度和成功率上优于传统方法，成功合成了一种高性能Zr基合金。

Conclusion: AIMatDesign展示了在闭环材料发现中的可靠性和潜力，为高维材料设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating
its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特定领域内预测可靠，但难以泛化到具有相同动态但环境特征不同的未知系统。

Method: FNSDA利用傅里叶模式自动分区识别共享动态，并通过低维潜在系统参数调整特定模式。

Result: 在四个代表性动态系统上，FNSDA以显著减少的参数成本实现了优于或竞争性的泛化性能。

Conclusion: FNSDA是一种高效且泛化能力强的动态系统建模方法。

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional
latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our
approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results
show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance
compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost. Our
code is available at https://github.com/WonderSeven/FNSDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在现实应用中的广泛部署，其安全性评估变得至关重要，尤其是对抗性提示下的表现。现有手动基准的静态性和更新困难难以跟上LLMs的快速发展。

Method: 提出ROSE框架，通过多目标强化学习微调对抗性LLM，生成多样化和情境丰富的对抗性提示。

Result: 实验表明，ROSE在揭示先进LLMs的安全漏洞方面优于现有方法，综合评估指标显著提升。

Conclusion: ROSE为更实用和现实导向的LLMs安全性评估迈出了一步。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper
contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，HiT-JEPA的分层设计能生成更丰富的多尺度表示。

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA通过分层设计有效整合了局部动态和全局语义，提升了轨迹表示的多样性。

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

TL;DR: LoRA-Mixer是一种轻量级MoE框架，通过动态路由任务特定的LoRA专家提升参数效率和任务保真度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合LoRA与MoE的方法在参数效率和任务保真度上存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出LoRA-Mixer，替换注意力模块的投影矩阵为动态路由的LoRA专家，支持联合优化或直接部署预训练模块。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著提升性能（如GSM8K提升7.61%），参数效率提高52%。

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer在高效性和性能上优于现有方法，适用于多种基础模型。

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,
SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of
LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer
achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base
models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer
achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,
using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong
performance.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex

mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the
temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates
contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing
policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep
Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal

This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming

Motivation: 准确建模人类移动性对理解疫情传播和及时干预至关重要，但稀疏的时空数据限制了传统时间序列模型的预测能力。

Method: 通过SPN技术，将每个网格单元的特征与其邻近H3网格的聚合信号结合，评估了三种预测模型（NLinear、PatchTST、K-U-Net）。

Result: SPN显著提升了预测性能，测试MSE降低了9.85%。

Conclusion: 空间平滑稀疏移动信号是一种简单有效的时空预测方法，适用于公共卫生危机。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic
spread and deploying timely interventions. In this work, we leverage a
large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital
Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast
mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial
sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits
the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we
propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)
technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its
immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting
backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input
lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting
performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings
demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple
yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public
health crises.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water
reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II
of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power
profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both
uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were
extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh,
validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats
for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating
and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular
methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network
trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰山漂移对气候系统和极地导航至关重要，但现有模型因数据稀缺和环境复杂性难以准确预测。

Method: 结合冰山漂移物理分析的解析解与残差学习模型，利用旋转增强谱神经网络捕捉全局和局部模式。

Conclusion: IDRIFTNET能有效捕捉冰山漂移的非线性复杂性，适用于数据有限和环境动态条件下的轨迹预测。

Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate
system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems
while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately
forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due
to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of
iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg
motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a
highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These
limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture
the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address
these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep
learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift
physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the
pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth
observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network
that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future
iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with
state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings
demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final
Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety
of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing
the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories
under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经元中心的新型模型融合算法，通过分组中间神经元并结合神经元贡献分数，有效整合多个训练好的神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型融合中因内部表示差异（如排列不变性、随机初始化或不同分布的训练数据）导致的挑战。

Method: 设计了一种神经元中心的融合算法，通过分组中间神经元并结合神经元贡献分数，创建目标表示，并由融合模型近似。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，新算法在零样本和非独立同分布融合场景中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效整合不同模型，适用于任意层类型，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one
representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents.
However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal
representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random
initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel,
neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple
trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of
training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent
models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with
its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach
incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore,
our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID
fusion scenarios. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点状V信息（PVI）的数据缩减策略，通过筛选高难度实例提升模型训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大规模数据集中选择最优实例以提升数据质量和训练效率的核心挑战。

Method: 1. 使用PVI量化实例难度并静态过滤低难度实例；2. 采用渐进式学习方法按PVI升序训练分类器。

Result: 实验表明，移除10%-30%数据后分类器性能损失极小（0.0001%-0.76%），渐进式学习还能提升0.8%准确率。

Conclusion: PVI策略能有效提升模型性能和训练效率，并成功扩展到中文NLP任务中。

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most
informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training
efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal
instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy
based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty
using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.
Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the
classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we
use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances
sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy
gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective
data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset
could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we
have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English
datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable
insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The codes are

Result: 聚类预处理减少模式数量且性能相当，某些流行指标效果不如其他指标。

Conclusion: 研究为图分类提供了质量指标选择的指导，并验证了预处理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and
attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network
analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task,
those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the
patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify
meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a
function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the
literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the
most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to
provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically
focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most
widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we
present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We
characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We
leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a
method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these
resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of
pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a
clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the
same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to
be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that
some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the
best results.

Motivation: 语音情感识别（SER）在多模态人机交互中很重要，但标记数据收集成本高。

Method: 提出LiSER框架，利用大型教师模型从语音和面部表示模型中提取知识，传递给轻量级学生模型。

Result: 在RAVDESS和CREMA-D数据集上验证，LiSER减少了对标记数据的依赖。

Conclusion: LiSER为低成本开发高效SER系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can
benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on
user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual
cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,
collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.
This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER
(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher
models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers
knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher
models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark
datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence
on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill为多任务学习提供了一种高效解决方案，降低了计算成本，适用于资源受限平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

Result: 理论分析显示FPG的方差渐近减少为O(t^(-alpha))，实验验证了35-68%的采样效率提升和24-52%的方差降低。

Conclusion: FPG为利用长期依赖关系提供了数学基础，且无额外计算开销。

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning
framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in
policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from
Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By
reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes
power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an
efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference
errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows
FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus
standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation
demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction
versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically
grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational
overhead.

Result: 理论模型在多种LLM和数据集上得到验证；外部数据在有限情况下不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 求解器-验证器差距是理解LLM自我改进动态的关键；外部数据在特定条件下可灵活使用。

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of
large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without
relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM
performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.
In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement
via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that
the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between
LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical
framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of
self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs
and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate
how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we
find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be
utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which
accords with the empirical observations.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

Result: 实验表明，FedHLM在新闻分类任务中减少了95%以上的LLM传输，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FedHLM适用于高效、可扩展的边缘AI应用。

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical
strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations,
particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables
within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We
propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN),
a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic

dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies.
Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 +

significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost),
achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and
non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and
temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static
techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which
limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these
challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative
framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel
topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts
and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and
network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale
spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology
combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an
attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical
observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates
nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior
performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system
efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident
forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences
as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then
aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To
ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply
a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time
series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level
metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression,
tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared
within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming
high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness
of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can
anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed
methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk
scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers
can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection
priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites
or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and

Motivation: 消防员干预中人员和物资资源分配依赖模拟，需高质量数据支持多种场景研究。

Method: 比较随机采样、表格变分自编码器、生成对抗网络、条件表格生成对抗网络和扩散概率模型等方法。

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了数据驱动故障检测的可信度和可解释性，适用于工业质量控制。

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate
tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level
generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a
usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and
a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We
present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing
level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders
and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically
assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and
output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability
of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion
model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level
approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model
uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to
train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating
that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI
allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve
health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such
predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite
behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with
physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation
models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from
162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization
strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our
model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including
individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The
model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves
further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results
underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and
demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

Result: 证明了二阶异构性假设的必要性和充分性，并给出了多种算法的紧界和最小-最大复杂度。

Conclusion: 论文阐明了本地更新算法在异构环境中的优势条件，为分析Local SGD提供了完整的理论指导。

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: PPFL-RDSN是安全、隐私保护的协作计算机视觉应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from low-resolution inputs using Residual
Dense Spatial Networks (RDSNs) is crucial yet challenging, particularly in
collaborative scenarios where centralized training poses significant privacy
risks, including data leakage and inference attacks, as well as high
computational costs. We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated
Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for lossy image
reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local
differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques, ensuring data
remains secure on local devices, safeguarding sensitive information, and
maintaining model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical
evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and
effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a
practical solution for secure and privacy-preserving collaborative computer
vision applications.

Method: 融合ResNet的梯度加权激活图和Transformer注意力展开，实现时空对齐，并加入NLP模块生成领域特定解释。

Result: 在PhysioNet数据集上准确率达94.1%（F1 0.93），UCI能源数据集上RMSE降至0.28 kWh（R2 0.95），优于基线模型3.8-12.4%。

Conclusion: 通过因果保真和时空对齐，该方法为透明、时间感知的决策提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Method: 开发了Gym4ReaL，包含多样化的任务以模拟现实挑战，并测试标准RL算法的表现。

Result: 标准RL算法在这些环境中仍具竞争力，但需新方法以充分发挥RL在复杂任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: Gym4ReaL为RL研究提供了更贴近现实的测试平台，推动算法在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable
progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated
environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,
the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such
as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.
Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current
benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary
environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities
explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive
suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and
evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite
includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of
practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,
standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based
benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the
potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性的挑战，现有PFL方法未能超越本地或集中式基线，表明协作方式与数据结构不匹配。

Method: 提出FEDMOSAIC方法，客户端自适应决定依赖他人程度及信任对象，通过共享未标记数据集的预测交换实现细粒度信任决策。

Result: FEDMOSAIC在多种非独立同分布场景下优于现有PFL方法，并提供收敛保证。

Conclusion: 数据感知协作在实现鲁棒和有效的个性化方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and
personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to
each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or
centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they
enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive
collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on
others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We
instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in
which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This
enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with
parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the
agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global
pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence.
Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across
diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard
assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration
for robust and effective personalization.

Method: 使用前馈神经网络（FFN）、BERT和GPT模型，在18种条件下进行匹配到样本（MTS）模拟，比较不同训练结构和关系类型。

Result: 拒绝关系影响模型表现，部分模型在等效性测试中表现良好，但结果与纯粹联想学习的概率代理相似。

Conclusion: 人工神经网络可能依赖联想学习策略，需更严格的标准来评估等效性模型。

Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE),
yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence
class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject
relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational
models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained
transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)
simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,
one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and
select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A
probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative
learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks
could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance
reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced
agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence
tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this
performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest
that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on
associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful
consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational
models of equivalence.

Motivation: 解决Q学习和双DQN中普遍存在的高估问题，探索更有效的深度强化学习方法。

Method: 提出深度双Q学习（DDQL），通过训练两个Q函数并相互引导来减少高估。

Result: DDQL在57款Atari 2600游戏中减少了高估并优于双DQN。

Conclusion: DDQL是一种高效且无需额外超参数的深度强化学习算法。

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in
Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL
algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address
Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to
de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets.
Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks
(DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN.
However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the
training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this
paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for
value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our
aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN
and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions
affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms
Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring
additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including
its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

Conclusion: 结构保持的Lift & Learn方法在保持物理结构的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于多种非线性PDEs。

Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine
learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn
structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach
based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses
knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent
quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics
obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making
model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted
quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms
analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained
optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a
structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields
computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the
underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the
generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed
structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the
one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the
two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional
Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed
learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving
data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: MamNet能有效检测多时间尺度的流量异常，适用于网络安全和流量管理。未来可结合外部事件信息优化模型。

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security
threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and
anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic
management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly
detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and
frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term
dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain
modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using
Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion
layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to
detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and
CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream
models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an
improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex
traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that
MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time
scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and
traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by
incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's
adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

Conclusion: AutoDS是迈向开放自主科学发现系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms
competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.
Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为μ²LLM的多尺度多模态大语言模型，用于自动化放射学报告生成（RRG），解决了信息提取和报告评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化放射学报告生成（RRG）旨在通过临床影像（如CT扫描）生成详细文本报告，以提高诊断和管理的准确性和效率。然而，RRG面临两大挑战：1）在资源限制下从影像数据中提取相关信息的复杂性；2）客观评估模型生成报告与专家撰写报告之间差异的困难。

Method: 论文提出μ²LLM模型，结合多尺度视觉分词器和文本分词器，通过μ²Tokenizer作为中间层整合多模态特征，并利用GREEN-RedLlama指导的直接偏好优化（DPO）提升报告生成质量。

Result: 在四个大型CT图像-报告医学数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，展示了μ²LLM在有限数据上微调的潜力。

Conclusion: μ²LLM在自动化放射学报告生成任务中表现出色，为RRG任务提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited
data for RRG tasks.

Motivation: 挑战情绪科学中普遍假设的情绪类别为固定生物心理类型的观点，验证情绪为可变实例的替代理论。

Method: 重新分析一项基于情绪类别固定模式的研究数据，采用最小假设的方差结构分析方法。

Result: 未观察到原始的情绪类别固定脑图模式，发现个体间显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究假设对科学结论有重大影响，需多方法验证假设的可靠性。

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中固定探索策略需要大量调参且忽略学习进度的问题，提出自适应探索机制以提升学习效率。

Method: 采用模型无关、数据驱动的探索机制，动态调整熵正则化（critic）和策略方差（actor）。

Result: 实现了与固定探索策略相同的最佳次线性遗憾界，数值实验显示自适应探索加速收敛并改善遗憾性能。

Conclusion: 自适应探索机制在无需大量调参的情况下，显著提升了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time
stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and
controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent.
We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively
adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor.
Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations
and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory
approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its
flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the
best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were
previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve
regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based
counterparts.

Result: MoNE在多种条件下优于基线方法，零样本任务准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: MoNE是一种有效且稳健的专家剪枝方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
by activating only a subset of experts per input token. However, deploying
MoE-based models incurs significant memory overhead due to the need to retain
all experts in memory. While structured pruning is promising to reduce memory
costs, existing methods often show suboptimal performance and unstable
degradation in three dimensions: model architectures, calibration data sources,
and calibration sample sizes. This paper proposes
Mixture-of-Novices-and-Experts (MoNE), a novel expert pruning method that
replaces redundant experts with lightweight novices to achieve effective and
robust model compression. MoNE evaluates expert redundancy based on two
metrics: access frequency and output variance. Experts exhibiting low usage and
stable outputs are pruned and replaced with lightweight novices-unbiased
estimations of their original outputs-minimizing performance degradation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE consistently outperforms baseline
methods with minimal accuracy degradation across the three dimensions,
confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Notably, it improves the average
zero shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks by up to 2.71 under 25\%
pruning ratio and 3.61 under 50\% pruning. The code is available at

Conclusion: TarFlowLM为语言建模提供了新的方向，展示了连续潜在空间建模的潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

Conclusion: HelixPipe通过创新设计有效解决了长序列Transformer训练中的性能瓶颈，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur
suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the
substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,
a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,
HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention
computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in
parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold
first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap
communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation
without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer
sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages
with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput
and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster
configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when
training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available

Conclusion: DDMP通过扩散模型和动态标签更新机制，成功解决了标签模糊问题，适用于部分标签学习任务。

Abstract: Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical
machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning}
(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels
associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of
diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their
potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.
Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the
perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively
refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model
to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the
generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label
for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch
between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model
for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information
between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial
diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to
estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated
during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is
progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage
of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文建模是NLP的关键挑战，现有Transformer架构的时间复杂度高，而SSMs虽提供次二次解决方案，但难以有效捕捉长距离依赖。

Method: 提出联合召回任务，证明SSMs无法在次二次时间复杂度内解决多查询联合召回，进而提出结合SSMs与CDSA的解决方案，并实现为HAX方法。

Result: 实验表明，HAX在合成和真实长上下文基准测试中优于SSMs基线及结合上下文无关稀疏注意力（CISA）的SSMs。

Conclusion: HAX通过理论分析和实际实现，显著提升了SSMs的长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

Conclusion: CGR方法为回归任务中的OOD泛化提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen
to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural
networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical
successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings,
while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are
overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR);
to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL
studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the
predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize
classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a
lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks
validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and
the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided
generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly
effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world
applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring
optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions
such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.
Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such
objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode
collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative
distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to
optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy
distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates
reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by
minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the
current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence
minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to
existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,
small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Conclusion: Optimistic-WS能显著提高多任务域中算法评估的质量和准确性，适用于运行时间较长的算法。

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

allows the model to efficiently handle both short-range and long-range

persistently stores past token representations using a gated update mechanism
inspired by recurrent networks. Rotary positional encoding is applied per
attention head to enable directionally disentangled, scale-invariant positional
signals. The architecture is implemented entirely from scratch in PyTorch, with
no reliance on high-level libraries, enabling transparent and modular
experimentation. Our model offers a lightweight and extensible design for tasks

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its
robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often
relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference
cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically
only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering
and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest
Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least
informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should
be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees.
The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF
on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets,
including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints
is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.
These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to
hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have
been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a
promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from
poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the
target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new
framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.
First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and
surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations
with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection
problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising
candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.
During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly
multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when
constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate
this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the
latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data
space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Safe RL的后门攻击可行性，强调了其潜在风险。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact
with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe
Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the
reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during
decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions.
First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor
attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that
involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant
backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative
action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the
properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack
framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights
the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of
such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data
types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured
electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining
strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model
learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the
next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction
of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on
predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation
model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when
new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is
evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee
osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals
a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that
our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly
task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合量子神经架构搜索（QNAS）的量子强化学习算法（QRL-NAS），以优化参数化量子电路（PQC）结构，提升学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子强化学习（QRL）使用固定的PQC结构，缺乏最优性验证，限制了性能。

Method: 提出QRL-NAS算法，通过QNAS动态优化PQC结构，结合量子神经网络的线性与非线性变换能力。

Result: 实验表明，QRL-NAS比固定电路的QRL获得更高的奖励，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QRL-NAS通过优化PQC结构，显著提升了量子强化学习的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through
environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency
due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition
and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of
high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural
networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as
the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear
transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical
neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures
based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper
proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search
(QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that
QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its
effectiveness and practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于残差奖励模型（RRM）的方法，通过结合先验奖励和学习奖励，显著提升了偏好强化学习（PbRL）的性能和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PbRL因需要训练奖励模型而收敛慢的问题，同时避免预训练和微调时不同损失函数带来的优化挑战。

Method: 提出RRM，将环境真实奖励分为先验奖励和学习奖励两部分，先验奖励来自用户猜测或逆强化学习，学习奖励通过偏好训练。

Result: 在Meta-World环境和真实机器人任务中，RRM显著提升了性能，加速了策略学习。

Conclusion: RRM有效结合先验知识，提升了PbRL的性能和效率，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn
high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Sheaf扩散是否能展现合作行为，以解决异质性数据和过平滑问题。

Method: 引入有向图的细胞Sheaf概念，定义其入度和出度Laplacian，并提出CSNN。

Result: 理论分析表明CSNN允许节点选择性关注远距离节点，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSNN通过引入方向性解决了Sheaf扩散的合作行为问题，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph
representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data
and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been
proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by
allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information
from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of
exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to
this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods
fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality.
To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over
directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We
leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs).
Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows
nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring
all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments
show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on
sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GANs成功，但其优化困难且易过拟合，需探索其成功与局限的理论基础。

Method: 将GANs视为贝叶斯神经网络，通过边际似然优化定义正则化策略，寻找最小描述长度解。

Result: 实验表明这些策略能平滑损失景观，提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为GANs的正则化策略提供了新视角，并展示了性能改进的潜力。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于认知负荷理论（CLT）的框架CLAI，通过量化认知负荷指标优化LLM推理过程，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理计算成本高的问题，现有方法缺乏认知理论指导。

Method: 引入CLAI框架，量化认知负荷指标（ICL_LLM、ECL_LLM、GCL_LLM），提出两种实现路径：CLAI-Prompt（零样本方法）和CLAI-Tune（微调模型）。

Result: 在复杂推理、长文本问答和代码生成任务中，显著减少token消耗（最高45%）且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人脑资源管理策略，CLAI框架能构建更高效、鲁棒和智能的AI系统。

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.
While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly
based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a
guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper
aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive
Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize
the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and
Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,
and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive
economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem
($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically
allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two
implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM
through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a
fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive
economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context
question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant
reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose
difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work
demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we
can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

<details>

Motivation: GNSS在密集城市环境中因多径和非视距误差导致精度下降，现有方法基于离线应用或缺乏灵活性的卡尔曼滤波启发式方法。

Method: 训练TGNN整合道路网络信息到卡尔曼滤波中，预测正确道路段及其不确定性用于测量更新。

Result: 在真实GNSS数据和开源道路网络上验证，定位误差减少了29%。

Conclusion: 首次提出结合道路网络数据和GNSS测量的深度学习定位方法，显著提升了精度。

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning
information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often
compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be
used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a
positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either
limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with
little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph
Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN
is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty
to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach
with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29%
decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only
KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based
approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine
the user position on Earth.

Motivation: 现有研究主要基于文本描述进行3D视觉定位，而基于语音的定位方法尚未充分探索且具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Audio-3DVG框架，包含对象提及检测和音频引导注意力模块，结合音频与空间信息。

Result: 实验显示Audio-3DVG在音频定位中达到新SOTA，甚至媲美文本方法。

Conclusion: 语音与3D视觉任务的结合具有潜力，Audio-3DVG为未来研究提供了有效框架。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Motivation: 传统分类器引导方法仅限于鲁棒分类器，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在扩展该方法，使其适用于未经噪声训练的非鲁棒分类器。

Method: 通过分析非鲁棒分类器在噪声条件下的性能下降问题，提出了一种基于一步去噪图像预测和随机优化启发的稳定化技术的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CelebA、SportBalls和CelebA-HQ数据集上提高了分类器引导的稳定性，同时保持了样本多样性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 本研究扩展了生成模型中条件采样技术的应用范围，使得更多类型的分类器可以作为引导分类器使用。

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while
maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to
advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a
broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于奖励作为“测试函数”的新框架，用于分析增量输入到状态稳定性（δISS），与传统控制理论中的Lyapunov函数方法不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制理论使用Lyapunov函数证明稳定性，而强化学习（RL）的价值函数基于非光滑且无界的奖励函数构建，无法直接作为Lyapunov证明。本文旨在建立RL价值函数与增量稳定性之间的新联系。

Method: 通过将增量输入到状态稳定性与Hölder连续奖励函数下RL价值函数的规律性联系起来，提出了一种新的等价关系。

Result: 证明了RL价值函数的规律性与增量稳定性之间存在直接联系，这种联系不同于传统的Lyapunov方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，RL价值函数的规律性可以独立于Lyapunov方法，为理解增量稳定性提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing
Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using
rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with
Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement
learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a
Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides.
Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov
certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental
input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the
regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a
H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity
of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be
understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based
approach to certifying stability in control theory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间通道注意力的网络SCAWaveNet，用于从GNSS数据中提取有效波高（SWH），通过融合空间和通道信息，显著降低了RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在利用CYGNSS数据时，未能充分利用跨通道信息交互，限制了性能提升。

Method: 设计了一种空间通道注意力机制，将DDM的每个通道特征建模为独立注意力头，并融合空间和通道信息。

Result: 在ERA5和NDBC浮标数据上，SCAWaveNet的平均RMSE分别为0.438 m和0.432 m，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SCAWaveNet通过有效融合空间和通道信息，显著提升了SWH提取的精度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive
global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant
wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly
utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt
single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the
benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address
this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely
SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each
channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the
fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a
lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial
and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and
channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using
four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves
an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE
reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the
average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC
buoy observations. The code is available at

Motivation: 序数分类问题在高风险领域（如医学和金融）中普遍存在，但现有研究主要关注名义分类和回归，缺乏对序数分类不确定性的量化方法。

Result: 在多个序数基准数据集上，该方法在错误检测和分布外检测中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 序数分类问题的不确定性评估应考虑其序数特性，该方法为可靠决策提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Ordinal classification problems, where labels exhibit a natural order, are
prevalent in high-stakes fields such as medicine and finance. Accurate
uncertainty quantification, including the decomposition into aleatoric
(inherent variability) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, is crucial
for reliable decision-making. However, existing research has primarily focused
on nominal classification and regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal
classification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and
variance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively
capture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and
minimial error distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
various tabular ordinal benchmark datasets using ensembles of gradient-boosted
trees and multi-layer perceptrons for approximate Bayesian inference. Our
method significantly outperforms standard and label-wise entropy and
variance-based measures in error detection, as indicated by misclassification
rates and mean absolute error. Additionally, the ordinal measures show
competitive performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering the ordinal nature of classification
problems when assessing uncertainty.

Conclusion: 平衡DRPS和OrderedLogitNN为QDE研究提供了更可靠的方法和评估标准，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

Abstract: Computer manufacturers offer platforms for users to describe device faults
using textual reports such as "My screen is flickering". Identifying the faulty
component from the report is essential for automating tests and improving user
experience. However, such reports are often ambiguous and lack detail, making
this task challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
addressing such issues. This study evaluates 27 open-source models (1B-72B
parameters) and 2 proprietary LLMs using four prompting strategies: Zero-Shot,
Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and CoT+Few-Shot (CoT+FS). We conducted
98,948 inferences, processing over 51 million input tokens and generating 13
million output tokens. We achieve f1-score up to 0.76. Results show that three
models offer the best balance between size and performance:
mistral-small-24b-instruct and two smaller models, llama-3.2-1b-instruct and
gemma-2-2b-it, that offer competitive performance with lower VRAM usage,
enabling efficient inference on end-user devices as modern laptops or

Abstract: Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, computers can now simulate
realistic and complex natural processes. We apply this capability to predict
how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire
and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We
present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a
new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed
outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the
inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models
typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a
single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect
physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This
technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for
anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment
and response planning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in certain
real-world industrial applications, yet its broader deployment remains limited
by inherent challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable learning
dynamics. This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs)
as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting
environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert
demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are
incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based
learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments
compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force
optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations
significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with
GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the
potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods
complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and
enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy
function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules.
Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows
that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to
match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining
likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it
impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning
the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained
with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic
interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we
combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function.
On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free
energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with
exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between
metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced
computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed
quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code
level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared
classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV
prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal
links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved
92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical
algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted
HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart.
Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV
cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable
influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and
efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways.
This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for
PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.

Abstract: Many of the observations we make are biased by our decisions. For instance,
the demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices
are influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making
under this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to
learn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous
uncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their
effective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust
optimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically
by constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing
actions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that
this robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability
as a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage
stochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can
now be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an
information-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain
information about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We
present several computational experiments for pricing and inventory
assortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in
online learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach
has consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous
setting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made.
While this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it
does affect the correct point forecast that should be made.

Abstract: Accurately predicting potato sprouting before the emergence of any visual
signs is critical for effective storage management, as sprouting degrades both
the commercial and nutritional value of tubers. Effective forecasting allows
for the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing
waste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the
ban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to
health and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of
significantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily
rely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological
changes have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A
reliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely
intervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,
where early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In
this work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To
this end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables
early prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals
recorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the
recorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and
trains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we
incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection
of potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a
subset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all
potatoes. Despite promising results, further refinements are necessary to
minimize prediction errors, particularly in reducing the maximum observed
deviations.

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进拓扑表示方法，有效解决了GNN和transformer的局限性，推动了神经网络预测器的发展。

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and
deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as
accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers
have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However,
each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to
represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization
when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink
neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while
overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging
the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We
introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer
named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach
consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency
prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

Motivation: 现有3D分子生成模型依赖强归纳偏置（如SE(3)等变性），但仍难以保证物理合理性。TABASCO旨在通过简化架构提升效率和实用性。

Method: TABASCO采用标准非等变变换器架构，将分子原子视为序列生成，并在生成后确定性重建键。

Result: 在GEOM-Drugs基准上，TABASCO达到最优PoseBusters有效性，推理速度比基线快10倍，且展现出未硬编码的旋转等变性。

Conclusion: TABASCO为高效、简约的生成模型提供了范例，适用于药物设计等专业任务。

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant
inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph
message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated
molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which
relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer
architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds
deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and
message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and
scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves
state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster
than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance
despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training
minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such
as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our
implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.

Method: 引入一种新型随机量化器（SQ），结合差分隐私和最小量化误差；提出聚类大小优化技术和线性融合方法以提高模型聚合精度。

Result: 数值模拟验证了该方法在隐私保护和学习效用方面优于传统的LaplaceSQ-FL算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了FL中的隐私和量化异构性问题，提升了学习效用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional
LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于图数据，还可扩展到其他分类任务，为MPNNs的泛化研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link
prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has
led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in
practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains
poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in
graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and
link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@
assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and
assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the
influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to
analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive
node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural
parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure.
Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond
graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting.
Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our
understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.

Conclusion: SEPAL是一种高效、可扩展的知识图谱嵌入方法，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large
knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to
distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream
applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:
they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive
learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory
limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation
ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality
embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce
global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of
entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message
passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream
machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms
previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base
embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

Result: TARS训练的模型在模糊查询上分配更多计算资源，实现了更好的安全与拒绝平衡，并提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TARS为训练LLM抵御越狱和有害请求提供了一种有效的开放方法。

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

Conclusion: 该方法在架构层面加速早期训练，同时保持渐近行为。

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an
ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework
for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via
stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the
objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence
toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle
points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers
that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent
directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable
the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show
that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after
sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's
invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in
the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while
the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these
results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates
early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language
Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient
processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing
Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads
across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication
overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)
sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to
overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for
long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length
across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an
16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new
collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with
precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal
communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.
Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only
negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication
costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that
All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on
256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a
clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously
intractable sequence lengths.

TL;DR: SciBORG是一个模块化框架，通过动态构建LLM代理并增强有限状态自动机内存，实现复杂科学任务中的自主规划和可靠执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂科学工作流中因内存、规划和工具集成限制而应用受限的问题。

Method: 动态构建代理，结合有限状态自动机（FSA）内存，支持上下文感知决策和状态跟踪。

Result: SciBORG在物理和虚拟硬件中验证，实现可靠执行、自适应规划和可解释状态转换。

Conclusion: 内存和状态感知是代理规划和可靠性的关键，为复杂环境中的AI代理部署提供了通用基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural
language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex
environments.

Motivation: cAI系统在移动边缘平台上部署时面临动态工作负载变化和异构计算资源的挑战，现有方法无法有效处理DNN和transformer的并发推理需求。

Method: 提出Twill框架，采用任务亲和性感知的集群映射和迁移、优先级感知的任务冻结/解冻以及DVFS技术。

Result: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin NX平台上实现并部署Twill，相比现有技术平均减少54%的推理延迟，同时满足功率预算。

Conclusion: Twill为cAI系统在移动边缘平台上的高效调度提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient,
livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial
intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent
agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this
article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are
semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used
for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of
urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we
survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,
encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and
learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into
five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and
urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we
discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world
deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey
aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and
to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban
intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机方法（如归一化流、条件流匹配和修正流）在生成语音韵律中的有效性，并与传统确定性方法和真人发音进行了比较。结果表明，随机方法能生成与人类发音相媲美的自然韵律，并提供额外的可控性。


<details>

Motivation: 生成语音中表达性韵律是一个挑战，尤其是在显式建模韵律参数（如音高、能量和时长）的系统中。本文旨在探索随机方法在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 比较了归一化流、条件流匹配和修正流等随机方法与确定性基线及真人发音的效果。

Result: 随机方法生成的韵律与人类发音相当，并能通过调整采样温度提供额外可控性。

Conclusion: 随机方法在生成自然韵律方面表现优异，同时增强了系统的可控性。

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating
expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in
text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model
prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration,
which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In
this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this
task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified
Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as
well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective
evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par
with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech.
Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the
sampling temperature to be tuned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中AFE和后端分类器分开设计效果不理想，因此需要一种联合优化方法以提高性能。

Method: 通过SNR感知的训练循环调整模拟带通滤波器（BPF）的传递函数参数，并使用协同设计损失函数LBPF优化滤波器和分类器。

Result: 在SKY130 130nm CMOS工艺中实现，优化设计在10关键词分类任务中达到90.5%-94.2%的准确率，功耗和电容面积分别减少8.7%和12.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的协同设计方法显著提升了系统性能，同时降低了功耗和面积。

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable
analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and
backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in
this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend
classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum.
More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass
filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training
loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows
superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented
in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved
90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of
input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters.
Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and
12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

Method: 构建包含350万分子和3亿快照的松弛数据集，训练MLIP基础模型预测能量和力，并通过几何优化或直接微调获取几何结构。

Result: MLIP基础模型能有效提供分子几何结构，并通过几何微调提升下游性质预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 基于松弛数据训练的MLIP模型能为分子性质预测提供有价值的几何结构。

Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are
typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory
(DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first
curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million
molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained
with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular
structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in
different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it
can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization,
providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions.
To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce
geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation
models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D
geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models
trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that
benefit property predictions.

Abstract: Understanding the functional roles of financial institutions within
interconnected markets is critical for effective supervision, systemic risk
assessment, and resolution planning. We propose an interpretable role-based
clustering approach for multi-layer financial networks, designed to identify
the functional positions of institutions across different market segments. Our
method follows a general clustering framework defined by proximity measures,
cluster evaluation criteria, and algorithm selection. We construct explainable
node embeddings based on egonet features that capture both direct and indirect
trading relationships within and across market layers. Using transaction-level
data from the ECB's Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), we demonstrate
how the approach uncovers heterogeneous institutional roles such as market
intermediaries, cross-segment connectors, and peripheral lenders or borrowers.
The results highlight the flexibility and practical value of role-based
clustering in analyzing financial networks and understanding institutional
behavior in complex market structures.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文提出神经网络信息编码的双重空间假设（特征身份与特征整合），开发了联合训练架构，显著提升了重构性能和KL散度误差，并展示了非线性特征交互的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAE）方法假设激活可通过线性叠加分解为稀疏可解释特征，但未能消除多义性并存在行为错误。论文提出双重编码假设以解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了顺序和联合训练架构，同时捕捉特征身份和整合模式，并通过小非线性组件高效捕获计算关系。

Result: 联合训练提升重构性能41.3%，减少KL散度误差51.6%，非线性组件独立提升16.5%。干预实验显示整合特征对实验操作敏感，并影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 论文为神经网络的双重编码、非线性特征交互提供了系统性证据，并提出了从后验特征分析到集成计算设计的架构范式转变。

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network
interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear
superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction
fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit
pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode
information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:
feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding
hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture
identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%
reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This
architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared
norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing
directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve
16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of
computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention
experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration
features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and
produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant
interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic
evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful
nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural
paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational
design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

Result: 机器学习方法在加速优化、全局探索和知识迁移方面表现出色，混合框架进一步提升了性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括复杂性管理、几何无关表示、制造约束整合以及多物理场协同设计的进展。

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures
achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for
recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization
methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces
and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine
learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review
frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of
representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and
input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in
the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates
optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,
latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient
global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique
trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design
discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization
with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve
scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting
open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,
geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,
and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Conclusion: 结合物理模板与数据驱动模型，为未来宇宙学巡天提供了稳健的红移估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is critical for observational
cosmology, especially in large-scale surveys where spectroscopic measurements
are impractical. Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine
learning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid
method that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided
neural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the
network architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training
process. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention
mechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for
uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML
dataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and
spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a
3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model
satisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts
below 3. These results highlight the potential of combining physically
motivated templates with data-driven models for robust redshift estimation in
upcoming cosmological surveys.

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural
hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains
fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,
stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each
tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We
introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative
architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference
along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This
formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference
mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,
masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce
geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot
generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining
for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage
training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on
large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts
and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad
applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy
analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic
stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By
bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware
manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical
AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,
promptable reasoning system. Project page: https://douyimin.github.io/GEM

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic
augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and
generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight
the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and
suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for
enhanced music analysis and score generation.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了TTS系统中风格迭代优化的空白，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

TL;DR: CTFT-Net是一种用于语音超分辨率的复杂时频变换网络，通过重建幅度和相位提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音超分辨率方法主要关注幅度重建，但相位重建对感知质量同样重要。

Method: CTFT-Net结合复杂全局注意力块和复杂Conformer，建模依赖关系并捕获长程和局部特征，同时使用时域和多分辨率频域损失函数。

Result: 在VCTK数据集上，CTFT-Net在极端上采样任务（2 kHz到48 kHz）中优于现有模型，有效重建高频且无噪声伪影。

Conclusion: CTFT-Net通过联合重建幅度和相位，显著提升了语音超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing
the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction,
recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved
perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency
Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex
domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention
block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex
conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency
reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and
multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization.
Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave,
WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling
(2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy
artifacts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉输入的无声人脸语音转换（SFVC）任务，并提出了MuteSwap框架，通过对比学习和最小化互信息来解决这一挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换依赖音频输入，但在无声视频或嘈杂环境中无法使用。SFVC任务旨在仅通过视觉输入实现语音转换。

Method: 提出MuteSwap框架，利用对比学习对齐跨模态身份，并通过最小化互信息分离共享视觉特征。

Result: 实验表明，MuteSwap在语音合成和身份转换上表现优异，尤其在嘈杂环境下优于依赖音频输入的方法。

Conclusion: MuteSwap证明了SFVC的可行性，并展示了其训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Mamba和时频多头注意力模块的新架构MambAttention，用于单通道语音增强，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决序列模型（如Mamba）在训练集上过拟合的问题，并探索混合Mamba与时频注意力模型的泛化性能。

Method: 提出MambAttention架构，结合Mamba和共享时频多头注意力模块，并使用VB-DemandEx数据集训练。

Result: 在VB-DemandEx数据集上训练后，MambAttention在域外数据集（DNS 2020和EARS-WHAM_v2）上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambAttention在泛化性能上优于其他模型，共享时频多头注意力模块是关键因素。

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies
have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in
single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and
self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has
demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the
training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding
self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for
single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid
Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance
have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech
enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended
(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging
noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our
proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar
complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020
and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset
VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the
time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization
performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a
notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our
MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all
reported evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统问责机制在AI决策中介下被削弱，需研究跨国背景下组织如何应对监管、伦理和文化压力。

Method: 结合TAM、ANT和制度理论，扩展TAM以包含合规性和合法性，通过ANT重新定义问责为网络化关系属性。

Result: 提出两种组织策略：内部治理重构和外部行动者网络参与，以促进负责任的AI采纳。

Conclusion: 问责是全球社会技术网络中共构的，需结合用户感知、治理逻辑和规范期望。

Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping
organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI
systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and
financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on
control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate
the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and
institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in
response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national
boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global
socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by
governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate
compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.
Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent
property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies
including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network
engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption
in the accounting domain.

TL;DR: VTS-AI结合视觉思维策略与AI代理，从非结构化报告中提取商业洞察，速度快且结果丰富，支持人工调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代企业面临大量非结构化报告，传统处理方式效率低且不敏捷。

Method: VTS-AI采用三层架构（微观、中观、宏观），标记问题并链接到源页面，生成可搜索的YAML文件。

Result: 测试显示VTS-AI速度与ChatGPT相当，但提供更丰富的结果（如页面位置、严重性评分等）。

Conclusion: VTS-AI有望成为生产就绪的快速商业分析工具，未来计划包括财务比率映射和数据安全层。

Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these
documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when
quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual
Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and
thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from
unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers
(micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls
them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an
18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt
yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity
scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the
same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots
the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed.
Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding
finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a
Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim
to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business
analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合AST嵌入和RAG的新方法，用于提升SVRF代码合成的准确性和效率，在740条DRC规则测试中显示出40%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着半导体节点进步，传统SVRF开发方法因复杂设计规则而失效，亟需新方法填补技术空白。

Method: 采用AST嵌入进行结构验证，结合RAG注入领域知识，提出SVRF专用评分框架。

Result: 在740条DRC规则测试中，代码生成准确性提升40%。

Conclusion: 该方法优化了SVRF开发流程，提升了生产效率和代码质量。

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor
applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes
create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development
ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel
methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring
semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with
domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific
scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In
our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses
relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our
methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy
compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry
expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development
under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and
efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through
design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve
overall productivity.

TL;DR: iPanda是一个利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动化协议一致性测试的端到端框架，显著提高了测试代码生成的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协议一致性测试方法依赖人工创建大量测试用例和脚本，效率低下且耗时。LLM的文本理解和代码生成能力为自动化提供了新机会。

Method: iPanda结合关键词生成测试用例、基于代码的检索增强生成方法生成可执行测试代码，并通过迭代自校正机制优化代码质量。

Result: 实验表明，iPanda在测试代码生成的成功率（Pass@1）上比纯LLM方法提高了4.675至10.751倍。

Conclusion: iPanda为协议一致性测试提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，显著优于传统方法和纯LLM方法。

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations
comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches
involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process
labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities,
providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose
iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol
conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its
implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically
generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based
retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the
implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code
quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine
generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the
generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between
implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on
various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based
approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by
factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

Result: AI辅助开发小幅提升后续开发速度和代码健康度，习惯性用户效果更显著；AI助手显著减少任务完成时间。

Conclusion: AI助手能有效加速开发且未降低代码可维护性，建议未来研究关注代码膨胀和认知债务风险。

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming
software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity
improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.
[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants
affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can
evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled
experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional
developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web
application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled
trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.
[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in
subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither
difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was
statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase
1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous
productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in
task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was
55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants
can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning
signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research
focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the
build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during
implementation.

Motivation: 在动态低信任环境中，无法通过预先规范或集中监督确保AI代理的正确性。

Method: 任务发布为意图，解决者竞争完成；验证者事后检查正确性，挑战者可抵押触发验证。

Result: 错误代理被惩罚，正确反对者奖励，激励对齐使正确性成为纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 协议通过激励机制确保AI代理在低信任环境中的正确性。

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is
cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI
agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be
assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a
protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive
verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to
fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness
checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking
against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed
and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes
erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers,
challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash
equilibrium.

Conclusion: VLTL-Bench填补了现有研究的空白，为可验证的NL-to-LTL翻译提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to
temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on
existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the
translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground
atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical
feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete
state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their
own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating
performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general
systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic
Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and
verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three
unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications
and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the
benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.
While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that
many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)
translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after
each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different
substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances
in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here:

Motivation: 锂离子电池在实际应用中需要高精度的电化学模型以确保安全和高效运行，但现有降阶模型难以捕捉复杂非线性行为。

Method: 结合扩展单粒子模型（ESPM）和进化集成稀疏学习策略，构建混合模型，并采用保形预测方法量化不确定性。

Result: 混合模型（ESPM + AESI）显著提高了电压预测精度，均方误差降低达46%，预测区间覆盖率高达97.41%。

Conclusion: AESI框架有效提升了模型精度和可靠性，适用于复杂工况下的锂离子电池建模。

Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient
operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as
electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a
balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to
capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell
voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations,
this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework
that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by
compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended
Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning
strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework
incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed
uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the
reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating
conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage
prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on
unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal
prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage
ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and
stability selection, respectively.

Conclusion: CaaS是管理多星座DS2D连接的高效可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising
solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of
satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity
for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and
frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite
movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within
single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the
vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in
suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article
proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire
multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically
forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The
formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide
tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative
strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite
access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS
significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover
overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D
connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于海洋、天气和气候的数值模拟通常粗糙，且观测数据稀疏不完整，需要开发有效的方法从这些数据中推断高分辨率信息。

Method: 应用了四种生成扩散模型方法：两种基于预训练模型的引导方法（SDEdit和DPS），以及两种需要配对数据训练的条件方法（普通变体和分类器自由引导）。

Result: SDEdit生成不物理的场，DPS能以低成本生成合理重建但平滑了细节；条件方法能重建缺失细节并保持统计一致性。

Conclusion: 研究为地球物理反问题中的模型部署提供了实用指导，权衡了实现难度、保真度和一致性。

Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are
coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four
generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of
forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from
coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a
pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process
score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and
classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and
observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and
anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two
observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy
observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the
reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and
quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors.
We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength.
Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates
reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed
fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they
reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with
observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra.
Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable
from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs
between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of
the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in
geophysical inverse problems.

contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding
non-validating clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于网络的代币化生态系统中信任问题，如验证链下资产数据和确保监管合规。

Method: 提出AI治理的智能体架构，整合智能体与区块链，通过自治智能体管理代币化流程，AI治理层监控行为并实施信任机制。

Result: 案例研究表明，该架构通过实时AI异常检测和链上执行，有效降低风险（如欺诈性挂牌和洗钱）。

Conclusion: 结合AI治理、多智能体系统和区块链可显著增强代币化资产生态系统的信任，为安全合规的代币化平台提供新框架。

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial
instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring
trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges,
from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This
paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent
agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative
assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the
tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and
lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent
behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic
incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security,
and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data
authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets
illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and
money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain
enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance
with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in
tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy
asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to
deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

*Hasan Yiğit*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI-Hybrid TRNG是一个深度学习框架，直接从物理噪声中提取高熵随机数，无需量子设备或昂贵射频接收器，适用于资源受限平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机数生成器依赖专用硬件，成本高且体积大。AI-Hybrid TRNG旨在通过低成本硬件和深度学习实现高质量随机数生成。

Method: 结合低成本射频前端和CPU时序抖动训练动态内外网络，生成高熵32位随机流，无需量化步骤。

Result: 生成的随机数通过NIST SP 800-22测试和19项定制统计测试，满足加密标准，无预测偏差，模型体积小于0.5 MB。

Conclusion: AI-Hybrid TRNG扩展了高质量随机数生成器的应用范围，适用于安全系统、加密协议、嵌入式设备等。

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform
entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum
devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a
low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and
then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number
generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural
sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences.
Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based
method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and
integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while
forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The
model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft
cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG
broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure
systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic
simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索新型视觉状态空间模型（如ViM）的安全隐患，填补后门攻击研究的空白。

Method: 提出BadViM框架，使用共振频率触发器（RFT）和隐藏状态对齐损失，攻击ViM模型。

Result: BadViM攻击成功率高且不影响干净数据准确性，同时对常见防御措施具有强抵抗力。

Conclusion: ViM易受后门攻击，BadViM展示了其高效性和隐蔽性，需加强防御研究。

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision
Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture,
especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically
underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim
models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while
maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the
susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel
backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed
BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency
sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed
triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss
that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by
aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack
success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits
remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,
PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor
attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对联邦学习的新型投毒攻击FedPoisonMIA，并通过实验验证其有效性，同时提出防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性使其易受投毒攻击，但现有攻击多关注模型完整性，隐私威胁研究不足。

Method: 提出FedPoisonMIA攻击，恶意客户端通过本地模型更新推断成员信息；同时设计防御机制。

Result: 实验证明攻击有效，防御机制能显著降低其影响。

Conclusion: FedPoisonMIA揭示了联邦学习的隐私风险，防御机制为实际应用提供了保护方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without
needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the
era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to
adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning
attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data
to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade
the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to
privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA,
a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA
involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership
information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate
the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various
datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach
reduces its impact to a degree.

attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero
Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to
systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing
rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on
generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band
verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators,
cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework
that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach
is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an
era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be

(CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was
evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational
models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of
0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894

versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging
interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.

Motivation: 传统MOLLI方法扫描时间长且易受患者呼吸运动影响，现有深度学习方法忽视物理约束，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用物理信息神经ODE（LSTM-ODE）建模时间动态，支持稀疏数据采集和高效空索引估计。

Result: 实验显示该方法在原生和对比后序列中均表现优异，物理建模优于纯数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合物理约束和深度学习，显著提升了T1映射的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac
parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing
cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI)
acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure
mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients
with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image
quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a
signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies
have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened
sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless,
existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting
interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated,
end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these
challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse
subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test
time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable
selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags.
Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both
native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our
physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Conclusion: MTCNet通过运动-拓扑引导策略显著提升了4D二尖瓣超声分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue
characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual
delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and
single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates
whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to
inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond
mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining
multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2
maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by
two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was
trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower
quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the
myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.
Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated
segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and
model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined
optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual
segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification
performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,
with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were
split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.
Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer
agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <
0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining
multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Motivation: 传统SINDy方法在处理高维慢-快系统时，回归问题计算复杂且病态，需要改进。

Result: 方法显著降低了SINDy库的条件数和规模，提高了慢流形动力学的识别准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高维慢-快系统的建模问题，具有计算高效和鲁棒性强的优势。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established
as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from
data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression
problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned.
Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying
slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables
have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate
terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy
library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and
efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow
manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of
the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables
restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is
leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains
only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than
containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom
library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific
problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a
snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that
our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the
SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow
manifolds.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP)
has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins,
RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation
metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.
However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological
languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in
biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively
translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules
as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong
correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of
structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive
paradigm in biological language modeling. Code can be found at

### [212] [InSight-R: A Framework for Risk-informed Human Failure Event Identification and Interface-Induced Risk Assessment Driven by AutoGraph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00066)

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于AutoGraph的框架（InSight-R），用于自动化识别人为故障事件（HFEs）和评估界面设计对操作员性能的影响，解决了传统HRA方法的主观性和数据整合不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人为可靠性分析（HRA）方法依赖专家判断，存在主观性和数据整合不足的问题，尤其是在评估人机界面设计对操作员性能的影响方面。

Method: 研究提出InSight-R框架，通过AutoGraph构建的界面嵌入知识图（IE-KG）连接实证行为数据，自动化识别HFEs并评估界面设计风险。

Result: InSight-R提高了HFE识别的客观性和可解释性，并为数字化控制环境中的动态实时人为可靠性评估提供了可扩展的途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为界面设计优化提供了实用见解，并推动了机制驱动的HRA方法的发展。

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such
as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error.
While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely
adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure
events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This
reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and
limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches
lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design
contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To
address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed
human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven
by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the
interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated
graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables
automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated
operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between
designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R
not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification
but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human
reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework
offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to
the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用AI技术设计情感适应性叙事平台，以减少政治极化并促进开放思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治极化阻碍了民主公民教育，AI技术为干预提供了新机会。

Method: 结合情感计算技术，开发AI-DCS平台，实时调整叙事内容以维持情感投入。

Result: 原型平台整合了情感识别和注意力追踪，通过GPT-4个性化叙事语言。

Conclusion: 为情感敏感的AI策略奠定了基础，并探讨了公民教育和技术挑战。

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating
identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies
offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and
promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that
leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain
students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote
perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories
from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective
computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation
into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the
storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively
developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS)
platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention
tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time.
Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with
beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing
linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that
center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a
foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address
affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with
implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI
challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning
environments.

Motivation: 探索BLV个体如何平衡GenAI工具的便利性与视觉隐私挑战。

Method: 通过21名BLV个体的访谈研究当前实践与未来设计偏好。

Result: 发现六种隐私场景及设计偏好，如设备本地处理、敏感内容屏蔽等。

Conclusion: 提出以用户为中心的GenAI隐私设计建议，扩展隐私概念与数据责任。

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to
interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can
enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user
independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In
this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences
of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21
participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that
balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for
privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation,
indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional
content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device
processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction,
privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored
interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to
support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of
privacy and responsible handling of others data.

Abstract: The integration of various AI tools creates a complex socio-technical
environment where employee-customer interactions form the core of work
practices. This study investigates how customer service representatives (CSRs)
at the power grid service customer service call center perceive AI assistance
in their interactions with customers. Through a field visit and semi-structured

burdens during the call (e.g., typing and memorizing) but also introduces new
burdens (e.g., earning, compliance, psychological burdens). This research
contributes to a more nuanced understanding of AI integration in organizational
settings and highlights the efforts and burdens undertaken by CSRs to adapt to
the updated system.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟社交媒体政治话语时的行为，发现其输出会放大极化、风格化信号和有害语言，并引入结构性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在模拟政治话语时的表现及其对社会代理可靠性的影响。

Method: 基于2024年美国总统选举期间的2100万次X平台互动，构建了1186个真实用户的LLM代理，在受控条件下回复政治推文，比较零样本和少样本初始化效果。

Result: 研究发现，更丰富的语境化提高了内部一致性，但也放大了极化、风格化信号和有害语言，并出现“生成夸张”现象。

Conclusion: LLMs并非模拟用户，而是重构用户，其输出反映了内部优化动态而非观察行为，挑战了其在内容审核和政策建模中的使用。

Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating
political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X
during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on
1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under
controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological
cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one
comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini,
Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and
toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency
but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We
observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a
systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our
analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their
outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed
behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as
social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative
simulations, and policy modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测变量相关时会低估其贡献，导致偏差。

Method: 引入DFI方法，利用最优传输将相关特征转换为独立变量，计算解耦空间中的重要性。

Result: DFI提供了重要性得分的理论分解，具有根n一致性和渐近正态性，计算高效。

Conclusion: DFI有效解决了相关性导致的偏差问题，为特征重要性量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feature importance quantification faces a fundamental challenge: when
predictors are correlated, standard methods systematically underestimate their
contributions. We prove that major existing approaches target identical
population functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this
correlation-induced bias.
  To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Disentangled Feature
Importance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$
decomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into
independent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation
distortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed
back through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled
decomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability
for latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA
variances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.
  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general
transport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of
importance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original
feature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve
second-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and
transport map estimation errors are $o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI
avoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the
challenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving
computational efficiency.

Result: 在多个数据集（包括天文模拟）上验证了Aux-VAE的有效性。

Conclusion: Aux-VAE通过简单修改标准VAE损失函数，成功实现了潜在变量的解耦。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of statistically extracting generative
factors from complex, high-dimensional datasets in unsupervised or
semi-supervised settings. We investigate encoder-decoder-based generative
models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, focusing on disentangling
low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent physical factors.
Introducing Aux-VAE, a novel architecture within the classical Variational
Autoencoder framework, we achieve disentanglement with minimal modifications to
the standard VAE loss function by leveraging prior statistical knowledge
through auxiliary variables. These variables guide the shaping of the latent
space by aligning latent factors with learned auxiliary variables. We validate
the efficacy of Aux-VAE through comparative assessments on multiple datasets,
including astronomical simulations.

Method: 提出GRAND机制，基于潜在空间模型，确保节点级差分隐私并保留网络结构。

Result: 实验证明，GRAND发布的网络在分布上与原始网络渐近一致。

Conclusion: GRAND是首个实现节点级隐私保护且保留结构特性的网络发布方法。

Abstract: Differential privacy is a well-established framework for safeguarding
sensitive information in data. While extensively applied across various
domains, its application to network data -- particularly at the node level --
remains underexplored. Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus
exclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified
network statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the
network. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node
Differential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
network release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring
node-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties. Under a
broad class of latent space models, we show that the released network
asymptotically follows the same distribution as the original network. The
effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 通过构造的势函数和条件扩散的前向-反向模拟方法，提出了一种非嵌套蒙特卡洛程序，用于计算薛定谔桥过程的最终维度分布。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is
central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and
begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte
Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric
way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context
of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in
the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we
develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence
rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an
application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final
dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the
constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for
conditional diffusions.

Result: 新方法在点云对齐和形状保持方面优于现有OT方法，并在考古学中展示了应用潜力。

Conclusion: PW距离在2D和3D点云分析中具有广泛应用前景，尤其在机器学习和计算几何领域。

Abstract: Due to its invariance to rigid transformations such as rotations and
reflections, Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) was introduced in the literature as an
optimal transport (OT) distance, alternative to Wasserstein and more suited to
tasks such as the alignment and comparison of point clouds. Having that
application in mind, we carefully build a space of discrete probability
measures and show that over that space PW actually is a distance. Algorithms to
solve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by
discussing and testing several initialization strategies. We then introduce the
notion of PW barycenter and detail an algorithm to estimate it from the data.
The result is a new method to compute representative shapes from a collection
of point clouds. We benchmark our method against existing OT approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in scenarios requiring precise alignment and
shape preservation. We finally show the usefulness of the PW barycenters in an
archaeological context. Our results highlight the potential of PW in boosting
2D and 3D point cloud analysis for machine learning and computational geometry
applications.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing
parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in
materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited
training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To
overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling
approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art
text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method
introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing
temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,
enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and
capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity
and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the
model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently
transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism
using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16
encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean
IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical
descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and
real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path
errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the
first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,
offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

Conclusion: 研究首次为生产级模型中的自旋浴类比提供了强实证证据，为可解释性和新型生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and
Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a
first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building
on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a
production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian
for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic
\textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should
dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic
evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong
negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's
empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations
further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath
predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming
a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our
findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy
in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable,
physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for
novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter
physics and AI.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware
specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process
models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware
extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This
is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in
the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in
the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with
general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is
possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting,
enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully
combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data
dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving.
Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently
explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application
of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency.
The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance
of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive
data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对人类合作行为的长期影响，发现LLMs在评估合作行为时存在差异，可能影响社会合作动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类越来越依赖LLMs支持社会决策，但其长期影响未知，尤其是对基于间接互惠和声誉的人类合作的影响。

Method: 研究通过21种LLMs评估合作行为，并结合进化博弈论模型分析LLM驱动的判断对社会合作动态的影响。

Result: LLMs在评估合作行为时对“好对手”表现一致，但对“坏声誉”个体存在差异，这些差异显著影响合作普及率。提示干预可引导LLM判断。

Conclusion: 研究强调了调整LLM规范以维护人类合作的必要性，并揭示了LLM建议与长期社会动态之间的联系。

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions
in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral
and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based
social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected
when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a
pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect
reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.
Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide
21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate
-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these
interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary
game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where
the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of
LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating
cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and
between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.
We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact
the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,
showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through
goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term
social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order
to preserve human cooperation.

TL;DR: MVGBench是一个用于多视图图像生成模型（MVGs）的全面基准测试，评估3D几何和纹理一致性、图像质量及语义（使用视觉语言模型）。它解决了现有指标依赖真实目标视图的问题，并提出了新的3D自一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MVGs评估方法依赖真实目标视图，不适用于生成任务（存在多种解决方案）。此外，不同MVGs的训练数据（视角、合成数据、光照）差异大，缺乏对鲁棒性和泛化性的全面评估。

Method: MVGBench评估三个方面：最佳配置性能、泛化到真实数据和鲁棒性。提出3D自一致性度量，比较从生成的多视图中重建的3D模型。系统比较了12种MVGs在4个数据集上的表现。

Result: 发现现有方法在鲁棒性和泛化性上的局限性，并确定了关键设计选择。基于此提出了ViFiGen，在3D一致性上优于所有评估的MVGs。

Conclusion: MVGBench为MVGs提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了现有方法的不足，并提出了改进方案。代码、模型和基准套件将公开。

Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image
generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture,
image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs
have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing
metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is
not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while
differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on
different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to
these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly.
Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices
contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects:
best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of
comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric
which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We
systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and
synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of
existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we
find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we
propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D
consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.

### [227] [Estimating Correctness Without Oracles in LLM-Based Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00057)
*Thomas Valentin,Ardi Madadi,Gaetano Sapia,Marcel Böhme*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“不连贯性”的度量方法，用于在没有正确实现（oracle）的情况下量化LLM生成代码的错误概率，并证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码可能存在语法正确但事实错误的问题，如何在没有正确实现的情况下量化其错误概率是一个挑战。

Method: 提出“不连贯性”度量方法，作为错误的概率下界，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能自动识别约三分之二的错误程序，且无假阳性报告，与oracle评估结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 不连贯性评估可替代oracle评估，为LLM生成代码的可靠性提供了一种高效且可靠的度量方式。

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most
successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:
LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually
incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can
we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,
that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a
lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program
for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an
extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our
incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of
incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based
evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.
In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by
the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of
LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

Method: 研究了两种几何高斯逼近方法：微分同胚和黎曼指数映射，并探讨了它们的关系。

Result: 证明了这类几何高斯逼近具有普适性，能够逼近任何概率分布。

Conclusion: 讨论了是否存在统一的微分同胚方法，能为特定分布族提供高质量的高斯逼近。

Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior
distributions, is of central interest in many applications. We study the
expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of
approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian
exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric
Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We
further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian
approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability
distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability
distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly
high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“moment sampling”的新方法，通过文本到视频时刻检索模型指导帧采样，提升长视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中表现不佳，传统帧采样方法易丢失关键帧或引入冗余信息。

Method: 使用轻量级时刻检索模型优先选择与问题最相关的帧，提出“moment sampling”方法。

Result: 在四个长视频问答数据集和四种先进视频大语言模型上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了长视频问答性能，且模型无关。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: ER-EMU算法通过自适应经验回放和领域距离度量选择历史数据，解决了云边协作目标检测中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态交通环境中，模型在适应新数据分布时会遗忘旧知识，现有方法未能有效利用历史数据。

Method: 提出ER-EMU算法，结合FIFO经验缓冲区和DDM-ES算法，利用MK-MMD度量领域差异，优先选择与当前领域差异大的历史数据。

Result: 在Bellevue交通视频数据集上，ER-EMU显著提升了多种云边协作目标检测框架的性能。

Conclusion: ER-EMU通过优化历史数据选择和多样性训练，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视觉推理任务中的表现，发现其在特定场景（如CaughtCheating）中表现极差，揭示了现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多数基准测试中表现优异，但在人类侦探级别的任务中表现如何尚不明确。论文旨在探索其在高难度场景中的能力。

Method: 通过设计CaughtCheating任务（基于社交媒体中检测伴侣可疑行为的场景），对GPT-o3等MLLMs进行实验和分析。

Result: 在CaughtCheating任务中，GPT-o3的表现几乎为零，表明现有模型在复杂视觉推理任务中存在显著不足。

Conclusion: CaughtCheating任务为MLLMs提供了具有挑战性和实用价值的测试场景，成功解决此类任务将推动模型达到人类侦探水平的感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: MR-CLIP是一种多模态对比学习框架，通过将MRI图像与DICOM元数据对齐，学习对比感知表示，无需依赖人工标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描的准确解释依赖于图像对比度的精确理解，但现有标签（如T1或T2加权）过于粗略，且元数据常不完整或噪声多，影响临床应用。

Method: 提出MR-CLIP框架，通过对比学习对齐MRI图像与DICOM元数据，学习对比感知表示。

Result: 在跨模态检索和对比分类任务中表现优异，支持解剖不变表示。

Conclusion: MR-CLIP解决了元数据不可靠问题，具有临床应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

TL;DR: 论文提出并比较了三种用于全切片图像（WSI）中伪影检测的鲁棒方法，旨在解决WSI在癌症诊断中因伪影影响分析的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片成像（WSI）在癌症诊断中广泛应用，但伪影会干扰图像分析，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出了三种方法：基于基础模型的FMA、基于深度学习的DLA（ResNet50）和基于知识的KBA，用于检测六种常见伪影。

Result: FMA表现最佳（AUROC: 0.995），优于DLA（0.977）和KBA（0.940）。还开发了质量报告评分卡。

Conclusion: FMA在伪影检测中效果最优，为WSI分析提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

TL;DR: MANTA是一个多模态学习框架，通过文本对齐统一视觉和听觉输入，解决了语义对齐、时间同步、多尺度表示和稀疏信息检索等挑战，显著提升了长视频问答和跨模态理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法通常将不同模态分开处理，导致表示和推理的不一致性。MANTA旨在通过统一的文本空间解决这一问题。

Method: MANTA采用信息论优化实现跨模态语义对齐，自适应时间同步，分层内容表示和上下文感知检索，并通过数学框架证明其最优性。

Result: 在长视频问答任务中，MANTA将最先进模型的准确率提高了22.6%，在超过30分钟的视频中提升27.3%，同时在时间推理和跨模态理解任务中分别提升23.8%和25.1%。

Conclusion: MANTA通过新颖的密度估计技术最小化冗余并保留稀有信号，为多模态表示的统一提供了新基础。

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且实现简单、计算成本低。

Conclusion: ONLY为LVLM的实时部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实X射线数据集上均能提升多视图骨折分类性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习合成视图对应关系可作为预训练策略，有效增强真实数据上的多视图骨折检测能力。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in

### [240] [Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292)
*Ali Mammadov,Loïc Le Folgoc,Guillaume Hocquet,Pietro Gori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多保真度模型融合策略，用于减少多实例学习（MIL）方法在数字病理学中的性能波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MIL方法在WSI分类中性能波动大的问题，提高可靠性和可重复性。

Method: 通过训练多个模型并基于验证分数平均最稳定和有前景的模型，减少性能波动。

Result: 在多个数据集和MIL方法上验证了该策略的有效性，显著降低了性能波动。

Conclusion: 该策略可应用于现有MIL模型，简化超参数调优并提高计算效率。

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据缺乏多摄像头共享场景的维度，MOVi-MC-AC填补了这一空白，为计算机视觉任务提供更丰富的上下文信息。

Method: 通过模拟多摄像头视频场景，生成包含模态分割和内容补全标签的数据集，支持对象检测、跟踪和分割任务。

Result: 数据集包含5.8百万个对象实例，是模态分割领域规模最大且首个提供真实模态内容的数据集。

Conclusion: MOVi-MC-AC为模态分割和内容补全任务提供了新的基准，推动了计算机视觉领域的发展。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了CGEarthEye，一个专为吉林一号卫星设计的遥感视觉基础模型框架，通过多模态对比学习策略和全球覆盖的自监督数据集JLSSD，实现了在多个遥感任务上的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率光学遥感影像的获取渠道有限，限制了高分辨率遥感视觉基础模型的发展。吉林一号卫星拥有丰富的亚米级影像资源，为填补这一空白提供了可能。

Method: 提出CGEarthEye框架，包含五个不同参数规模的骨干网络（总计21亿参数），并开发了全球覆盖的多时相自监督学习数据集JLSSD。采用季节性对比、增强对比和掩码补丁标记对比策略进行预训练。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的评估表明，CGEarthEye在四种典型遥感任务中均达到SOTA性能，且在特征可视化、模型收敛、参数效率和实际应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: CGEarthEye的卓越表征能力有望推动吉林一号数据在传统地球观测应用中的更广泛和高效使用。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaDeDup是一种混合框架，结合密度修剪和模型反馈，自适应地减少数据冗余，提升大规模模型训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据集的计算负担和冗余问题，传统方法在任务无关性或计算成本上存在不足。

Method: AdaDeDup先分区并密度修剪，再用代理模型评估修剪效果，自适应调整阈值。

Result: 在Waymo等基准测试中显著优于基线，减少性能下降54%，修剪20%数据后性能接近原始模型。

Conclusion: AdaDeDup有效提升数据效率，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

*Yihao Zhen,Qiang Wang,Yu Qiao,Liangqiong Qu,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ATSTrack的视觉语言跟踪器，通过对齐视觉和语言输入的时间和空间尺度差异，改进了特征修正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言跟踪中的主要挑战是目标运动导致的视觉输入与语言描述之间的不对齐。现有方法未充分考虑视觉和语言输入在时间和空间尺度上的固有差异。

Method: ATSTrack将语言描述分解为具有不同属性的短语，并根据其与视觉输入的时间和空间对应关系进行细粒度特征修正。此外，引入视觉语言标记以利用前一帧的修正语言信息指导视觉特征提取。

Result: 实验结果表明，ATSTrack的性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: ATSTrack通过解决时间和空间尺度差异问题，提升了视觉语言跟踪的效果。

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Configural Shape Score (CSS)来评估模型对全局形状配置的敏感性，发现自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型表现最佳，并强调长程依赖对形状识别的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代视觉模型主要依赖局部纹理线索，忽略了全局形状配置的重要性。本文旨在评估模型对形状配置的绝对能力，而非与纹理的对立。

Method: 提出CSS评分，通过Object-Anagram对测试模型对全局形状配置的敏感性，并分析86种卷积、Transformer和混合模型。

Result: 自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型（如DINOv2、SigLIP2和EVA-CLIP）在CSS中表现最佳，且依赖长程交互。

Conclusion: 未来视觉系统应同时整合局部纹理和全局形状配置，而非二选一。

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效机器学习流程，用于解决度假租赁平台中房间场景发现与分组问题，以及识别卧室床型，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 度假租赁平台中大量未分类的房产图片给旅行者理解空间布局带来挑战，尤其是同类房间较多时。

Method: 结合监督学习模型（房间类型检测和重叠检测）与聚类算法，利用多模态大语言模型映射卧室床型。

Result: 整体流程表现出色，显著优于对比学习和预训练嵌入聚类等方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于实时和数据稀缺环境，为旅行者提供了更好的空间布局理解。

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

TL;DR: Box-QAymo是一个用于评估和微调视觉语言模型（VLMs）在用户指定对象上的时空推理能力的数据集和基准，通过边界框和层次化评估协议揭示当前VLMs在真实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中难以捕捉用户意图，现有数据集局限于全场景描述或路径预测，无法评估VLMs对局部用户驱动查询的响应能力。

Method: 提出Box-QAymo数据集，通过用户绘制边界框表达意图，采用层次化评估协议（包括属性预测、运动理解和时空推理），并通过众包和严格质量控制确保数据多样性。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在感知问题上的显著局限性，揭示了与现实世界性能的差距。

Conclusion: Box-QAymo为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶系统奠定了基础，支持真实场景下的有效用户沟通。

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽在多种应用中表现稳健，但某些注意力头可能对最终表示产生负面影响，消融这些头可能提升性能。

Method: 提出AAT方法，通过操纵注意力权重抑制特定头的贡献，并针对不同场景整合两种策略。

Result: AAT在多种领域下游任务中表现一致提升，跨模态检索召回率最高提升11.1%。

Conclusion: AAT能高效优化大规模视觉语言模型，且几乎不增加推理成本。

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决在实际应用中无法微调主干网络时，如何处理低质量且静态的嵌入表示，以实现高效的跨域少样本学习。

Method: 方法是将少样本分类问题表示为多实例验证任务，并设计了一个名为'MIV-head'的分类头，该分类头不依赖于任何预训练主干网络且计算高效。

Result: 实验表明，MIV-head在跨域少样本图像分类任务中表现优异，与现有部分微调方法相比具有更高的准确性，同时适应成本更低。

Conclusion: 结论是MIV-head是一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于无法微调主干网络的少样本学习场景。

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频是动态数据流，现有视觉语言模型在持续学习时面临灾难性遗忘和更新冲突的挑战，受人类海马体记忆机制启发，提出新方法。

Method: 使用多方向监督模块捕捉跨模态关系，设计对比提示学习方案隔离任务特定知识，模拟海马体的绑定与分离机制。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中，Bisecle有效减轻遗忘并提升跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Bisecle通过模拟海马体机制，为视频语言持续学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReStraV提供了一种高效、低成本的AI生成视频检测方案，为利用神经表示几何进行检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Motivation: 现有方法在位置嵌入和时序多属性学习上存在局限性，影响了道路网络的准确重建。

Method: TopoStreamer引入了流式属性约束、动态车道边界位置编码和车道段去噪三项关键技术。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上，TopoStreamer在车道段感知和中心线感知任务中分别提升了3.4% mAP和2.1% OLS。

Conclusion: TopoStreamer通过改进时序一致性和位置信息学习，显著提升了车道段拓扑推理的准确性。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练潜在扩散模型的无数据集统一图像修复方法，通过循环后验采样和多模态理解模型提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么针对特定任务设计，泛化性差，要么依赖配对数据集，受限于封闭集约束。

Method: 利用预训练潜在扩散模型，结合多模态理解模型提供语义先验，通过轻量级模块对齐退化输入，并采用循环细化进行后验采样。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为统一图像修复提供了一种高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

### [255] [Do Echo Top Heights Improve Deep Learning Nowcasts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00845)
*Peter Pavlík,Marc Schleiss,Anna Bou Ezzeddine,Viera Rozinajová*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在降水临近预报中利用Echo Top Height（ETH）作为辅助输入变量对深度学习模型的改进效果，发现ETH在低雨强阈值下有提升作用，但在高雨强时效果不一致且会低估降水强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报对天气敏感行业至关重要，现有深度学习模型多依赖2D雷达反射率数据，忽略了3D雷达数据中的垂直信息。研究旨在探索ETH作为辅助输入变量的潜力。

Method: 研究分析了ETH与雷达反射率的关系，并实现了一个单通道3D U-Net模型，同时处理雷达反射率和ETH作为输入。

Result: 模型在低雨强阈值下利用ETH提升了预报能力，但在高雨强时效果不一致且会低估降水强度。ETH在某些案例中有帮助，但也可能增加误差方差。

Conclusion: 研究为评估额外变量对临近预报性能的潜在贡献提供了基础，但需进一步优化ETH的使用方式。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

TL;DR: CAVALRY-V是一种针对视频多模态大语言模型（V-MLLMs）的对抗攻击框架，通过双目标语义-视觉损失函数和高效两阶段生成器，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索V-MLLMs在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，解决跨模态推理、时间依赖性和计算限制等挑战。

Method: 提出双目标语义-视觉损失函数和两阶段生成器框架，结合大规模预训练和微调。

Result: 在视频理解基准测试中，CAVALRY-V比现有攻击方法平均提升22.8%，在图像理解中提升34.4%。

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V为多模态系统的对抗研究提供了基础性方法。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves
flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit
regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image
understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's
potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用单张术中图像和术前数据高效训练NeRF的方法，解决了手术场景中多视图数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在3D重建和视图合成中表现优异，但在手术场景中，由于时间限制难以获取大量多视图数据。本文旨在通过单张术中图像和术前数据实现高效训练。

Method: 利用术前MRI数据定义训练所需的相机视角和图像，通过神经风格迁移（结合WTC2和STROTSS）将术中图像外观转移到术前数据集，实现快速单图像NeRF训练。

Result: 在四个临床神经外科案例中验证，与真实手术显微镜图像训练的NeRF模型相比，显示出高重建保真度和风格一致性，结构相似性指标良好。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在手术场景中单图像NeRF训练的可行性，克服了传统多视图方法的限制。

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

Conclusion: HPN将计算重构为残差驱动的热力学过程，为复杂动态系统建模提供了可解释、可扩展且物理基础的方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches in physics rely on global
optimization, limiting interpretability and enforcing physical constraints
externally. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing
computational framework in which learning emerges from local Hebbian updates
driven by violations of conservation laws. Grounded in non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and inspired by Prigogine/'s theory of dissipative structures,
HPNs eliminate the need for global loss functions by encoding physical laws
directly into the system/'s local dynamics. Residuals - quantified imbalances
in continuity, momentum, or energy - serve as thermodynamic signals that drive
weight adaptation through generalized Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate this
approach on incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, where physically
consistent structures emerge from random initial conditions without
supervision. HPNs reframe computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic
process, offering an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded
alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Sampling algorithms drive probabilistic machine learning, and recent years
have seen an explosion in the diversity of tools for this task. However, the
increasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase
in the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning
of samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough,
Wang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,
opening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical
benefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for
subsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the
surprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,
or the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training
RLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,
whose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we
explore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that
balance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the
associated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb
benchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH.

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain
temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent
activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory
mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or
heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has
shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor
states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the
resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability
and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe
for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome
this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature
embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We
demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes
enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously.
The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such
as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration
along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work
provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous
variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over
task-relevant manifolds.

Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content
optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across
digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due
to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral
factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble
learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs
a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across
abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual
embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user
characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy
combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address
limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with
pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal
similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture

Motivation: 理解神经网络在简单输入输出分布下的泛化能力，以解释其在真实数据集上的学习表现。

Method: 使用统计物理学方法，针对窄神经网络（隐藏单元数远小于输入维度）推导了泛化误差的闭式表达式，分析了有限温度（贝叶斯）和经验风险最小化估计器的性能。

Result: 理论预测了神经网络在回归或分类任务中的泛化误差，并揭示了神经元在样本充足时的专业化过渡现象。

Conclusion: 该理论为窄神经网络的泛化能力提供了完整的理论框架，适用于多种训练方法和任务。

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple
input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance
on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is
trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves
as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical
account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the
presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop
such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of
hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from
statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical
performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk
minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In
doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons
specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to
the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the
generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification
tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or
full-batch gradient descent.

Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital
literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of
uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical
model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students
formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in
text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general
astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement
and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class
and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the
importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI
can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods.
The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab
work, adaptable to scientific disciplines. See the guide to learning activities

TL;DR: KUL-KT是一种受生物启发的知识追踪架构，结合了Hebbian记忆编码和基于梯度的巩固，支持少样本个性化学习和自然遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受神经系统中记忆巩固机制的启发，旨在开发一种高效、可扩展且输入无关的知识追踪框架。

Method: 采用时间衰减的Hebbian记忆更新和Loss-aligned Internal Target（LIT）方法，结合快速Hebbian记忆和慢速线性网络。

Result: 在十个公共KT基准测试中表现优于基线，训练速度更快（1.75倍），内存占用减少99.01%。

Conclusion: KUL-KT是一种高效、灵活且生物基础的知识追踪框架，适用于大规模个性化学习。

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge
tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based
consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the
principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by
introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that
enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target
(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning
without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast
Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative
update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through
gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural
forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.
Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured
(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT
outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive
metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT
personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved
learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation
studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual
adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x
faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a
biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for
personalized learning at scale.

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful
new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models.
This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at
universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how
programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of
generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on
this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the
specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and
learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather
than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for
the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its
execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming,
thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming
course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the
incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the
training process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的机器学习框架，用于检测和分类晚型T和Y矮星，训练数据完全来自大气模型的合成光度测量。模型在合成和实证数据集上表现优异，并在实际应用中发现了新的候选天体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有检测框架对晚型T和Y矮星的统计不足，导致这类天体的普查不完整。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用ATMO 2020和Sonora Bobcat模型生成合成光度测量数据，训练分类器。通过多项式颜色关系分配光谱类型，并验证模型的性能。

Result: 模型在验证中表现出高准确度（>99%），光谱类型精度为0.35 +/- 0.37子类型。实际应用中发现了新的T8.2候选天体。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架能有效发现和分类晚型T和Y矮星，为未来类似研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population
of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics.
Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and
early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs
(UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework
capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on
synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO
2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of
magnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations
fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these
synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify
and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant
when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of
known UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type
precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5
degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery
of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of
this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from
photometric catalogs.

Motivation: MAGs无法表示循环因果关系，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入σ-MAGs，研究其性质，并给出马尔可夫等价类的表征。

Result: σ-MAGs能有效表示含循环因果关系的图结构。

Conclusion: σ-MAGs扩展了MAGs的应用范围，为更复杂的因果发现提供了工具。

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These
graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and
d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been
used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI
algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One
significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility
of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We
introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin
''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these
graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs
(DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent
DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization
of their Markov equivalence classes.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习方法假设动作执行完美，忽略了实际系统中的不确定性和执行偏差，导致性能下降。

Result: 在五个开源机械仿真环境中验证了框架的鲁棒性和实用性，显著提升了控制导向应用的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了理想化学习与实际实现之间的差距，为工程实践提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

Method: RoboEval引入了一套分层的语义任务，分解为技能特定阶段，并通过变体系统性地挑战空间、物理和协调能力，同时提供细粒度诊断指标和3000+人类示范。

Conclusion: RoboEval通过揭示策略失败的具体原因，提供了更深入、更具操作性的机器人操作理解，强调了超越单纯成功率的评估工具的必要性。

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多无人机系统中实现了无碰撞编队控制，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a
centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while
a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and
obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the
3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented
framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

Conclusion: PI-WAN有效解决了未知环境中的建模挑战，提升了四旋翼的轨迹跟踪性能。

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation
benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid
robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and
high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous
manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm
movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

Method: 提出RaGNNarok框架，利用图神经网络实时增强雷达点云，适用于复杂动态环境，且在低成本设备（如Raspberry Pi 5）上高效运行。

Result: 在定位、SLAM和自主导航等任务中表现可靠且通用，推理时间仅7.3毫秒。

Conclusion: RaGNNarok为低成本室内移动机器人提供了一种稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages
real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring

shape of boxes and presents a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised
box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a
range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a

significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system
that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring,
wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring
any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language
command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential
demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of
reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns.
Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical
phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth
datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping
operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style
transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit
style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate
domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping
operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of
intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by
reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells,
highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework
that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented
method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where
ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.
