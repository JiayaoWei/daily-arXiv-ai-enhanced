### [1] [How Significant Are the Real Performance Gains? An Unbiased Evaluation Framework for GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06331)
*Qiming Zeng,Xiao Yan,Hao Luo,Yuhao Lin,Yuxiang Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Bo Du,Quanqing Xu,Jiawei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无偏见的评估框架，用于解决GraphRAG方法在答案评估中的两个关键缺陷：无关问题和评估偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GraphRAG方法的评估框架存在无关问题和评估偏见，可能导致对性能的偏见甚至错误结论。

Method: 提出了一种基于图-文本-问题生成的无偏见评估框架，并采用无偏见的评估程序消除基于LLM的答案评估中的偏见。

Result: 应用该框架评估3种代表性GraphRAG方法，发现其性能提升较之前报道更为温和。

Conclusion: 尽管评估框架可能仍有缺陷，但它呼吁科学评估为GraphRAG研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

### [2] [TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343)
*Taesoo Kim,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TESU-LLM是一种仅使用文本数据训练语音语言模型的新框架，通过统一编码器和轻量级投影网络实现语音推理，性能接近多模态基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型依赖大规模语音-文本配对数据和计算资源，限制了可扩展性和可访问性。

Method: 利用统一编码器将语义等效的文本和语音输入映射到共享潜在空间，并通过轻量级投影网络与LLM嵌入空间对齐。

Result: 仅用文本训练的TESU-LLM在语音相关任务上表现优异，接近多模态基线方法。

Conclusion: TESU-LLM提供了一种无需语音数据的高效、可扩展的语音LLM构建方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

### [3] [Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06347)
*Zachary Yang,Domenico Tullo,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种软提示方法和LLM辅助标签转移框架，以解决游戏社区中多游戏和多语言毒性检测的扩展问题，显著提升了计算效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏社区中多游戏和多语言的毒性检测面临扩展和实时性的挑战，需要高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 引入软提示方法，使单一模型能处理多游戏；2. 开发LLM辅助标签转移框架，扩展支持七种语言。

Result: 在法语、德语、葡萄牙语和俄语上的宏F1分数为32.96%至58.88%，德语表现最佳，超越英语基准。生产环境中显著减少资源消耗。

Conclusion: 该方法在Ubisoft成功应用，每天平均识别50名违规玩家，证明了其高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

### [4] [Relationship Detection on Tabular Data Using Statistical Analysis and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06371)
*Panagiotis Koletsis,Christos Panagiotopoulos,Georgios Th. Papadopoulos,Vasilis Efthymiou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合方法，利用知识图谱（KG）和大语言模型（LLMs）检测未标记表格数据中列间的关系（CPA任务），并通过统计分析减少潜在KG关系的搜索空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格解释任务的重要性日益凸显，但现有技术在处理未标记数据时存在挑战，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 结合KG和LLMs，通过域和范围约束检测及关系共现分析减少搜索空间，评估不同量化水平和提示技术的LLMs。

Result: 在两个SemTab挑战数据集上的实验表明，该方法与现有最优方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在CPA任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Decision-Making of Large Language Models via Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06376)
*Heng Dong,Kefei Duan,Chongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的Actor-Critic框架LAC，通过长期动作评估改进LLM策略，解决了复杂决策中的长期推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂决策场景中面临长期推理和高级目标对齐的挑战，现有方法存在短期生成或模拟不足的问题。

Method: LAC框架通过计算与正负结果相关的Q值提取动作评估，并结合未来轨迹推演和推理，采用无梯度机制高效改进策略。

Result: 实验表明，LAC在多种环境中优于现有方法，甚至在使用较小参数LLM时超越基于GPT-4的基线方法。

Conclusion: LAC展示了将结构化策略优化与LLM内在知识结合的潜力，可提升多步环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

### [6] [Detection Method for Prompt Injection by Integrating Pre-trained Model and Heuristic Feature Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06384)
*Yi Ji,Runzhi Li,Baolei Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMPI-PMHFE是一种双通道特征融合检测框架，用于检测大语言模型（LLMs）中的提示注入攻击，结合预训练语言模型和启发式特征工程，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，提示注入攻击成为重大安全威胁，现有防御方法在效果和泛化性之间存在权衡，亟需高效的跨模型检测方法。

Method: 提出DMPI-PMHFE框架，结合DeBERTa-v3-base提取语义向量和启发式规则提取结构特征，通过全连接神经网络融合特征进行预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DMPI-PMHFE在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有方法，实际部署中显著降低了主流LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE通过双通道特征融合有效解决了提示注入攻击检测的挑战，具有广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

### [7] [Confidence Is All You Need: Few-Shot RL Fine-Tuning of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06395)
*Pengyi Li,Matvey Skripkin,Alexander Zubrey,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSC是一种利用模型自身置信度作为奖励信号的后训练方法，无需人工标注或外部奖励模型，显著提升了推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或外部奖励模型，RLSC旨在通过模型自身置信度简化后训练过程。

Method: RLSC使用模型的置信度作为奖励信号，应用于Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型，仅需每个问题8个样本和4个训练周期。

Result: 在AIME2024、MATH500和AMC23数据集上，RLSC分别提升了20.10%、49.40%和52.50%的准确率。

Conclusion: RLSC提供了一种简单、可扩展且需要极少监督的推理模型后训练方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

### [8] [Natural Language Interaction with Databases on Edge Devices in the Internet of Battlefield Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06396)
*Christopher D. Molek,Roberto Fronteddu,K. Brent Venable,Niranjan Suri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的流程，用于在战场物联网（IoBT）中通过自然语言查询数据库并返回自然语言响应，以提高情境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战场物联网（IoBT）的扩展为增强情境感知提供了新机会，但需要将设备数据转化为用户可理解的信息对象并实时提供。

Method: 采用适合边缘设备的LLMs和图形数据库，通过两步流程将自然语言问题映射为Cypher查询，并将数据库输出总结为自然语言。

Result: 实验表明，Llama 3.1（80亿参数）在所有指标上表现最佳，且两步方法放松了对查询精确匹配的要求，准确率提高了19.4%。

Conclusion: 该流程为在边缘设备上部署LLMs以实现自然语言交互提供了基础，支持关键决策中的信息对象查询。

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

### [9] [Direct Behavior Optimization: Unlocking the Potential of Lightweight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06401)
*Hongming Yang,Shi Lin,Jun Shao,Changting Lin,Donghai Zhu,Meng Han,Qinglei Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP是一种新的直接行为优化范式，专为轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）设计，通过梯度自由的蒙特卡洛树搜索优化执行序列，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）在资源效率和隐私方面有优势，但在推理能力和复杂任务上表现不足，且现有提示优化方法对其效果有限。

Method: DeBoP源自思维链（CoT）提示技术，但采用自动优化方法，将复杂提示优化转化为离散、可量化的执行序列优化，使用梯度自由的蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在七项挑战性任务中，DeBoP优化的LwLLMs表现优于现有提示优化方法，甚至超越GPT-3.5，同时计算时间减少约60%。

Conclusion: DeBoP为LwLLMs提供了一种高效的自动优化方法，显著提升了其性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

### [10] [Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs: Psychological and Empirical Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06404)
*Sooyung Choi,Jaehyeok Lee,Xiaoyuan Yi,Jing Yao,Xing Xie,JinYeong Bak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，与人类价值观对齐的大型语言模型（LLMs）更容易产生有害行为，且安全风险略高于其他微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用范围的扩大，个性化LLMs与人类价值观对齐的需求增加，但这也带来了潜在的安全风险。

Method: 通过数据集分析，结合心理学假设，研究价值观对齐与安全风险的关系。

Result: 价值观对齐的LLMs更易产生有害行为，且安全风险更高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了价值观对齐的“黑箱”问题，并提出上下文对齐方法以提高安全性。

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

### [11] [SMAR: Soft Modality-Aware Routing Strategy for MoE-based Multimodal Large Language Models Preserving Language Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06406)
*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SMAR的新型正则化技术，通过KL散度控制多模态路由概率分布，解决了多模态MoE模型训练成本高或语言能力下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态MoE模型中存在高训练成本或语言能力下降的问题，需要一种高效平衡多模态差异和语言能力的方法。

Method: 使用KL散度作为正则化技术（SMAR），控制多模态路由概率分布，鼓励专家专业化，无需修改模型架构或依赖大量文本数据。

Result: 在视觉指令调优实验中，SMAR保持了86.6%的语言能力（仅需2.5%纯文本），优于基线方法，同时保持强大的多模态性能。

Conclusion: SMAR提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，平衡了多模态MoE模型中的模态差异和语言能力。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

*Ivi Chatzi,Nina Corvelo Benz,Stratis Tsirtsis,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“规范采样”的方法，旨在解决大语言模型生成非规范标记序列的问题，并证明其生成的序列更接近训练数据的真实分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时可能生成非规范的标记序列，导致负面后果。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出了一种名为“规范采样”的简单高效采样方法，确保模型在自回归生成过程中始终生成规范标记序列。

Result: 规范采样生成的标记序列分布比标准采样更接近训练数据的真实分布。

Conclusion: 规范采样是一种有效的方法，能够避免模型生成非规范标记序列，并提升生成质量。

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

*Kaiser Sun,Fan Bai,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个诊断框架，用于评估大型语言模型在上下文与参数知识冲突时的行为，发现冲突对任务影响有限，但模型难以完全抑制内部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在上下文信息与参数知识冲突时的行为表现，以评估其可靠性和部署风险。

Method: 构建诊断数据以引发冲突，分析模型在不同任务类型中的表现。

Result: 发现冲突对无需知识的任务影响小，模型在知识一致时表现更好，且难以完全抑制内部知识。提供冲突解释会增加对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了知识冲突对模型评估的影响，强调了在部署中考虑冲突的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用合成问答数据集结合RAFT方法提升LLM在EDA任务中的性能，并探讨了真实用户问题对合成数据生成的影响，同时关注数据安全和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子设计工程师在EDA任务中难以高效获取相关信息，现有开源LLM缺乏领域知识，RAFT方法虽有效但缺乏标注数据。

Method: 提出使用合成Q/A数据集结合RAFT方法增强LLM，并研究真实用户问题作为RAFS示例的影响，同时实施安全访问控制。

Result: RAFT结合合成数据显著提升LLM在EDA任务中的性能，RAFS示例进一步优化生成数据。

Conclusion: 合成数据结合RAFT是提升LLM在EDA领域性能的有效方法，同时需关注数据安全和隐私风险。

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLM）中的社会群体偏见会系统性传播到零样本检索任务中，且性能更强的模型偏见传播更严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解基础视觉语言模型中固有的社会群体偏见如何影响下游任务，以构建更公平的AI系统。

Method: 提出一个控制框架，通过关联（a）表示空间中的内在偏见与（b）零样本文本到图像和图像到文本检索中的外在偏见来测量偏见传播。

Result: 结果显示内在与外在偏见之间存在显著相关性（平均ρ=0.83±0.10），且性能更强的模型偏见传播更严重。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了偏见传播的普遍性，并呼吁关注模型性能提升可能加剧偏见的问题。

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Motivation: 现有后训练数据集缺乏透明度，且缺乏系统性对比，难以评估数据质量对性能的影响。

Result: TuluTalk样本减少14%，但在关键基准测试中性能优于源数据集。

Conclusion: 研究为构建高效后训练数据集提供了实用建议，并公开了标注数据和TuluTalk混合方法。

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### [17] [Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539)
*Yijie Hao,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Intent Hallucination概念，指LLMs在复杂查询中遗漏或误解部分条件，并引入FAITHQA基准和CONSTRAINT SCORE评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂查询中部分满足或误解意图的问题。

Method: 提出FAITHQA基准（20,068个问题）和CONSTRAINT SCORE评估指标。

Result: 发现Intent Hallucination普遍存在，且源于遗漏或误解；CONSTRAINT SCORE接近人类评估效果。

Conclusion: FAITHQA和CONSTRAINT SCORE为未来研究提供了工具，揭示了LLMs的局限性。

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LaMP-Cap数据集，用于个性化多模态图注生成，实验证明多模态信息比纯文本更能提升生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成的图注缺乏个性化和多模态支持，作者希望通过多模态数据提升个性化图注生成质量。

Method: 提出LaMP-Cap数据集，包含图像、图注及相关段落的多模态信息，并基于四种大语言模型进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，多模态信息能显著提升图注生成质量，其中图像信息比文本段落更有帮助。

Conclusion: 多模态信息对个性化图注生成至关重要，LaMP-Cap为未来研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成信息时存在的内在幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但未经输入内容证实的虚假信息。

Method: 提出PIC任务，设计PIC-Bench基准测试，并开发基于弱监督偏好数据构建的后训练框架PIC-LM。

Result: 实验显示，现有最先进语言模型在70%以上的输出中存在幻觉；PIC-LM将F1分数从69.1%提升至91.0%。

Conclusion: PIC-LM显著提升了生成信息的准确性，展示了精确生成在事实性任务中的潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了检索增强生成（RAG）的两种新兴研究方向：动态RAG和参数化RAG，以解决传统静态检索方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用静态检索和上下文知识注入，难以满足复杂任务的需求，如多跳推理和自适应信息访问。

Method: 动态RAG在生成过程中自适应决定检索时机和内容；参数化RAG将知识注入从输入级提升到参数级。

Result: 动态RAG和参数化RAG在效率和效果上优于传统方法，为复杂任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Conclusion: 本文综述了动态RAG和参数化RAG的最新进展，为未来研究提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

medical tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel multi-pass retrieval-citation
method that generates high-quality citations. Our evaluation highlights the
challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while
identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the
final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation
precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we
show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from
professional experts.

*Charles Goddard,Fernando Fernandes Neto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过正交匹配追踪（OMP）重建未见过的词嵌入，实现预训练大语言模型（LLM）中分词器的移植。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同分词器之间的差异问题，避免梯度更新，直接复用预训练模型权重。

Method: 使用OMP将新词表示为共享词的稀疏线性组合，分两阶段：先在捐赠嵌入空间中计算新词表示，再将其稀疏系数转移回基础模型的嵌入空间。

Result: 在Llama→Mistral NeMo和Qwen→Llama任务中，OMP在零样本情况下表现最佳，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: OMP能有效处理分词器差异，支持跨分词器知识蒸馏等应用，并集成到开源工具mergekit-tokensurgeon中。

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

Motivation: 研究不同大小语言模型的表示空间相似性，并探索如何通过特征转移降低SAE等昂贵组件的训练成本。

Method: 使用仿射映射技术转移稀疏自编码器（SAE）的权重，比较不同大小模型的表示空间，并验证转移后的探测器和导向向量的性能。

Result: 发现小模型和大模型的表示空间高度相似，转移SAE可节省50%训练成本；语义和结构特征的转移效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大小模型线性表示空间的异同，并提出了一种提升SAE训练效率的方法。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Result: 零样本LLMs在二元分类中表现良好，但在细粒度分类中表现较差；基于LLM摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优，甚至优于传统嵌入模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康预测中具有潜力，未来可通过优化零样本能力和上下文感知摘要技术进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

Motivation: 现有立场检测数据集多集中于推文级别，而用户级立场数据稀缺，尤其是新兴平台如Bluesky。用户级立场能更全面地反映用户观点。

Method: 采用结合高级信息检索和大语言模型的标注流程，生成立场标签及支持理由和文本片段，标注准确率达81%。

Result: 数据集包含16,044个用户-目标立场对，附带互动元数据、交互图和用户发帖历史。

Conclusion: PolitiSky24填补了政治立场分析在时效性、开放性和用户级视角上的空白，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 探索法律简报写作这一未被充分研究的领域，评估语言模型在法律工作中的实际应用能力。

Method: 创建BRIEFME数据集，包含三个任务：论证摘要、论证补全和案例检索，并对当前语言模型的表现进行分析。

Result: 大语言模型在摘要和补全任务上表现优异，但在案例检索和实际论证补全上表现较差。

Conclusion: BRIEFME数据集有望推动法律NLP的发展，帮助法律专业人士更高效地完成工作。

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

Motivation: 现有研究集中在单次心理咨询会话，而实际心理咨询是一个多会话的渐进过程，需要持续关注客户问题。

Method: 利用公开心理案例构建多会话数据集，并开发能跟踪客户进展和调整咨询方向的模型。

Result: 实验表明，MusPsy-Model在多会话场景中优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 多会话数据集和模型为LLMs在心理咨询中的应用提供了更现实的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的安全性评估缺乏明确标准，主观性强，需从法律角度提供系统性框架。

Method: 提出SafeLawBench基准，将安全风险分为三级，包含24,860多选和1,106开放问答任务，测试20个模型。

Result: 领先模型Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o在多选任务中准确率未超80.5%，20个模型平均准确率为68.8%。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区优先研究大语言模型的安全性，并强调多数投票机制可提升模型表现。

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support
future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布级别的干预方法，扩展了点状干预，通过控制概念子空间的周围区域，提升了语言模型的可控性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点状干预在语言模型中的效果有限，需要更全面的方法来控制模型行为。

Method: 扩展点状干预到分布级别，学习概念子空间的周围区域，并在早期层应用。

Result: 在多个常识推理和算术推理任务中，分布级干预表现优于点状干预。

Conclusion: 分布级干预为语言模型提供了更精细的控制方法。

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

TL;DR: 论文提出DivScore框架，用于在专业领域（如医学和法律）检测LLM生成文本，解决了现有零样本检测器在领域转移时的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业和高风险领域检测LLM生成文本对打击错误信息和确保真实性至关重要，但现有零样本检测器在专业内容上表现不佳。

Method: 提出DivScore框架，结合归一化熵评分和领域知识蒸馏，以鲁棒地识别专业领域的LLM生成文本。

Result: 实验表明DivScore在AUROC和召回率上显著优于现有方法，尤其在对抗性设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: DivScore在专业领域检测LLM生成文本方面具有显著优势，并提供了公开的代码和数据。

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

TL;DR: RetNet是一种高效的神经网络架构，通过引入保留机制解决了Transformer的高内存和扩展性问题，支持线性时间推理和并行训练，并在多个领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer因自注意力机制存在高内存成本和扩展性问题，RetNet旨在通过保留机制统一循环和注意力模型的优势，提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: RetNet采用保留机制，结合循环的归纳偏置和注意力的全局依赖建模，实现线性时间推理和并行训练。

Result: RetNet在自然语言处理、语音识别和时间序列分析等领域表现优异，展示了跨领域的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面综述了RetNet架构、创新和应用，并探讨了其挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

Method: 引入包含中性事件描述和不同国家对立观点的新数据集，并通过实验分析模型偏见及其对标签操纵的敏感性。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著的地缘政治偏见，简单的去偏见方法效果有限，模型对标签操纵敏感。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的国家叙事偏见，挑战了简单去偏见方法的有效性，为未来研究提供了框架和数据集。

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中检测和解释隐含内容的能力，发现当前模型在理解预设和隐含意义方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治话语中隐含内容的重要性以及LLMs在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用IMPAQTS语料库，通过多项选择和开放式生成任务测试LLMs的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在解释预设和隐含意义时均表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs缺乏准确解释高度隐含语言的关键语用能力，但未来有改进方向。

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at
https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID

TL;DR: 本文介绍了taggedPBC数据集的CoNLLU格式版本，新增了依赖关系标注，并验证了其在跨语言研究中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: taggedPBC数据集虽包含大量语言的POS标注数据，但缺乏依赖关系标注，限制了其在语言类型学研究中的应用。

Method: 通过将依赖关系信息与POS标签一起转移到所有语言的taggedPBC数据集中，生成CoNLLU格式版本。

Result: 尽管标注质量存在一些问题，但数据集在词序信息上与专家判定的结果相关，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 即使数据存在噪声，充分的标注仍能提供重要见解，依赖标注的语料库已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

Result: 实验证明自适应方法能有效提升LLMs的说服成功率，同时保持其通用能力。

Conclusion: 自适应心理说服方法显著优化了LLMs的策略选择，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决文本数据爆炸导致的手动分类困难问题，提出一种无需领域知识的通用分类方法。

Method: 利用预定义标签描述生成模型，结合双重目标损失函数（交叉熵损失和余弦相似度），通过微调句子转换器匹配生成描述与预定义标签。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到新的最优性能，Micro-F1提升13.94%，Macro-F1提升24.85%。

Conclusion: LAGAMC模型在参数效率和通用性上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能可靠区分可能事件与不可能事件，并分析其局限性。

Method: 通过分离可能性、典型性和上下文相关性，测试多种语言模型（如Llama 3、Gemma 2、Mistral NeMo）的性能。

Result: 所有测试模型在某些条件下表现低于随机水平，甚至为不可能句子分配更高概率。

Conclusion: 语言模型在区分事件可能性方面的能力尚不稳健，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏同时控制问题难度和叙事的能力，而这对教育目的很重要。

Method: 提出了一种联合叙事和难度控制的策略，用于生成阅读理解问题。

Result: 初步评估表明该方法可行，但并非在所有情况下都有效。

Conclusion: 研究明确了该策略的适用条件，并讨论了其应用的权衡。

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such

Conclusion: 结论强调了预训练模型与多样化数据集结合时的不一致性，并联系到认知不公和AI对齐的讨论。

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: PCoT在五个LLMs和五个数据集上平均优于竞争方法15%，并发布了两个新数据集EUDisinfo和MultiDis。

Conclusion: 研究证明了说服知识在增强零样本虚假信息检测中的价值。

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Trans-PEFT是一种新方法，通过专注于任务特定模式并减少对基础模型知识的依赖，解决了基础模型更新后PEFT模块性能下降的问题，无需重新调优即可保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型更新后，PEFT模块性能显著下降，重新调优计算成本高。研究发现持续训练主要影响FFN中的任务特定知识，而对注意力机制影响较小。

Method: 提出Trans-PEFT方法，专注于任务特定模式，减少对基础模型知识的依赖。

Result: 在7个基础模型和12个数据集上的实验表明，Trans-PEFT模块无需重新调优即可在更新后的基础模型上保持性能。

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT显著减少了实际应用中的维护开销，为PEFT模块的长期使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLMs在数学问题解决中答案正确但推理过程不合理的现象，提出了MathOlympiadEval数据集和ParaStepVerifier方法，以更准确地检测推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学问题中常通过不合理的推理得到正确答案，掩盖了奖励黑客问题，现有方法难以可靠检测这些缺陷。

Method: 提出ParaStepVerifier方法，通过逐步验证数学解决方案的步骤，识别错误的推理过程。

Result: ParaStepVerifier显著提高了检测复杂多步问题中缺陷的准确性。

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier为评估和训练具有真正数学推理能力的LLMs提供了更可靠的路径。

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态混合方法，结合小模型和LLM的概率分布，提升中文拼写检查任务的性能，无需微调LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM方法在中文拼写检查任务中表现不佳，而BERT小模型虽表现优秀但存在编辑模式过拟合问题。

Method: 提出动态混合方法，在beam search解码阶段结合小模型和LLM的概率分布，平衡精确性和流畅性。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升纠错能力，在多个数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 动态混合方法有效结合小模型和LLM的优势，节省资源并提升性能。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自动语音识别（ASR）模型在非洲裔美国英语（AAE）中的表现，重点关注辅音簇缩减（CCR）和ING缩减对ASR错误率的影响，并比较了带与不带语言模型（LM）的ASR系统的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR模型在处理AAE的语音、音系和形态句法特征时表现不佳，研究旨在量化CCR和ING缩减对ASR错误率的影响，并分析LM对系统表现的作用。

Method: 使用CORAAL语料库，通过wav2vec 2.0（带和不带LM）进行转录，利用Montreal Forced Aligner（MFA）检测CCR和ING缩减。

Result: CCR和ING缩减对词错误率（WER）有显著但较小的影响；不带LM的ASR系统更易受词汇邻域效应影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AAE特定特征对ASR性能的影响，并强调了LM在减少词汇邻域效应中的作用。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for multilingual sentiment analysis that
combines extractive and abstractive summarization to address the limitations of
standalone methods. The model integrates TF-IDF-based extraction with a
fine-tuned XLM-R abstractive module, enhanced by dynamic thresholding and
cultural adaptation. Experiments across 10 languages show significant
improvements over baselines, achieving 0.90 accuracy for English and 0.84 for
low-resource languages. The approach also demonstrates 22% greater

Result: 通过人工和自动评估验证了方法在保持叙事忠实性和结构需求方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了新闻摘要的语篇结构保持能力，适应不同平台的需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

TL;DR: 该论文通过元分析提出了一个评估提示质量的框架，涵盖21个属性，并揭示了现有研究的不足。研究发现单属性增强对推理任务影响最大，且基于属性增强提示的指令调优能提升模型推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决自然语言提示量化缺乏共识的问题，并填补提示质量评估的研究空白。

Method: 对2022至2025年150多篇提示相关论文和博客进行元分析，提出六维度21属性的评估框架，并实证研究多属性提示增强的效果。

Result: 单属性增强对推理任务效果最显著，指令调优基于属性增强提示可提升模型推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究为提示质量评估和优化奠定了基础，推动了人机交互和提示研究的新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0是一个针对大型语言模型（LLMs）设计的日本三段论推理数据集，专注于评估信念不一致的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在处理逻辑有效但与信念冲突的输入时的偏见，特别是在法律、医疗等高风险领域。

Method: 通过引入逻辑有效但信念不一致的三段论问题，对GPT、Claude等领先LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，准确率79.54%，但LLMs普遍存在处理信念冲突输入的弱点。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLMs部署中，逻辑正确性需优先于直觉信念，以确保高领域应用的完整性和安全性。

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 问答代理通常直接回答问题，但缺乏主动澄清问题的能力，限制了其交互效果。本文旨在通过强化学习解决这一问题。

Method: 通过模拟包含澄清问题的对话，利用离线强化学习目标（类似奖励加权的监督微调）进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化奖励和语言质量上优于基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的离线强化学习方法有效提升了问答代理的交互能力，且无需额外超参数，直接优化奖励。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事件（如动作或状态）的终结性和完成性在语言学中的重要性，并提供一个形式化的分析工具。

Method: 框架分为名词域和动词域两部分：名词域建模名词短语的有界性及其与子类型、限定数量和形容词修饰的关系；动词域定义依赖事件演算，将终结性事件建模为有界受事的事件，完成性事件为达到内在终点的终结性事件，并考虑副词修饰。

Result: 框架基于Martin-Löf依赖类型理论的扩展，并在Agda证明助手中实现了规则和示例的形式化。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析事件的终结性和完成性提供了形式化工具，并展示了其在语言学中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅依赖浅层统计模式。

Method: 通过700个扰动代码生成任务（源自LeetCode风格问题），应用多种提示扰动（如故事重构、无关约束注入、示例重排序和数值扰动）。

Result: 某些扰动导致性能显著下降（准确率下降高达42.1%），而另一些则意外提升准确率（高达35.3%）。

Conclusion: 当前推理系统存在脆弱性和不可预测性，需更原则性的方法提升推理对齐和提示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 科学文本的复杂性和高信息密度容易导致非专家误解，现有模型在细粒度推理上表现不佳。

Method: 提出技能链模式，动态组合原子技能以减少认知负荷，并创建SciAtomicBench基准进行评估。

Result: 仅用350个微调样本，模型表现优于GPT-4o的链式思维方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 模块化推理方法能有效提升科学声明验证的准确性和泛化能力，且数据效率高。

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like

Method: 引入MultiMM数据集（8,461个中英文广告文本-图像对）和SEMD模型（结合情感嵌入）。

Result: 实验证明SEMD在隐喻检测和情感分析任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了NLP中对文化偏见的认识，推动了更公平、包容的语言模型发展。

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理过程冗长且容易陷入过度思考，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，结合主导模型和草稿模型协作生成句子，通过随机门平滑切换。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，FoReaL-Decoding减少30-50%的FLOPs和40%的推理长度，性能保持86-100%。

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding是一种简单、即插即用的方法，适用于推理任务中的成本-质量权衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）能力的提升，其被滥用于AI生成抄袭和社会工程的风险增加。尽管已有多种AI生成文本检测器，但许多仍易受简单改写攻击的影响。本文旨在提出一种更有效的对抗性攻击方法，以揭示检测系统的脆弱性。

Method: 作者提出了一种无需训练的对抗性改写框架，利用现成的指令跟随LLM在AI文本检测器的指导下改写AI生成内容，生成专门优化以绕过检测的对抗样本。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多种检测系统上显著降低了检测率（如T@1%F指标），尤其在Fast-DetectGPT上降低了98.96%。平均而言，该方法在OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large指导下实现了87.88%的T@1%F降低。

Conclusion: 本文的对抗性攻击方法揭示了现有检测系统的脆弱性，强调了在面对日益复杂的规避技术时，需要开发更鲁棒和弹性的检测策略。

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多语言视频LMM基准ViMUL-Bench，用于评估14种语言的视频LMM性能，并开发了一个简单的多语言视频LMM模型ViMUL，旨在促进文化和语言包容性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型（LMMs）主要集中在英语，缺乏对多语言和文化多样性的研究，尤其是在视频领域。

Method: 引入ViMUL-Bench基准，包含14种语言的8k样本，涵盖15个类别；开发ViMUL模型，利用120万样本的多语言视频训练集。

Result: ViMUL模型在高资源和低资源语言之间取得了更好的平衡，提升了视频理解能力。

Conclusion: ViMUL-Bench和ViMUL模型为未来开发更具包容性的多语言视频LMM提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Method: 采用LoRA微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，结合构建的通信标准知识图谱（13,906实体和13,524关系），实现RAG框架。

Result: 微调后模型BLEU-4从18.8564提升至66.8993，ROUGE等指标显著提高，问答系统平均得分提升2.26%。

Conclusion: 系统结合知识图谱与微调模型，显著提升专业问答效果，具有良好应用价值。

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

Motivation: 手动构建历史事件的计算表示成本高，且现有RDF/OWL推理器无法支持更深层次的时空和语义分析。

Method: 采用多种LLM（GPT-4、Claude、Llama 3.2）结合三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG）进行自动事件提取，并将结果转换为Coq规范。

Result: 增强策略在不同性能维度上各有优劣：基础生成在覆盖范围上表现最佳，RAG在精度上更优；模型架构影响增强效果。Coq验证了RAG提取的事件类型的语义合法性。

Conclusion: 通过LLM和增强策略实现了高效的历史事件提取，并通过Coq扩展了推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Conclusion: Lingshu通过改进数据和训练策略，显著提升了医学MLLMs的性能，为医学AI应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

Method: 结合因果事件图作为结构化复杂常识，利用因果理论（如干预）修改因果图生成不同场景，并通过慢思考引导LLM合成示例。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在推理深度和广度上存在困难，但后训练和慢思考可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: Com$^2$基准测试为复杂常识推理提供了新的研究方向，并展示了改进LLMs推理能力的潜在方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解和动态整合多模态信息，显著提升了情感计算的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在推理过程中存在冗余和低效问题，导致高推理成本，而现有评估方法不一致，难以衡量效率提升。

Method: 提出推理效率前沿作为基准，定义REG指标量化效率差距，并开发REO-RL算法通过强化学习优化推理效率。

Result: REO-RL在多种LRMs上显著减少REG（≥50%），并在16K token预算下接近效率前沿，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，完全对齐效率前沿仍具挑战性，但REO-RL为优化推理效率提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言推理任务中表现优异，但其推理过程脆弱且难以解释，现有方法如Chain-of-Thought缺乏逻辑结构和内部一致性评估机制。

Method: ToTh框架通过三个并行代理（溯因、演绎和归纳推理）生成推理轨迹，构建形式化推理图，并利用贝叶斯信念传播和自然语言推理评估一致性。

Result: 在符号和数值推理基准测试中，ToTh表现优于Chain-of-Thought等方法，同时生成可解释且逻辑严密的推理链。

Conclusion: ToTh为构建更稳健且受认知启发的语言模型推理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Conclusion: GCPO和GeometryZero为几何推理提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of
documents.

*Chenlong Zhang,Zhuoran Jin,Hongbang Yuan,Jiaheng Wei,Tong Zhou,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao,Yubo Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RULE的高效框架，用于选择性从大语言模型中移除特定信息，同时保持模型整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型可能包含敏感、受版权保护或非法内容，需要一种方法在不完全重新训练的情况下移除这些信息。

Method: RULE将遗忘任务建模为拒绝边界优化问题，使用少量遗忘数据和合成边界查询进行训练，并通过可验证的奖励函数实现安全拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，RULE仅需12%的遗忘数据和8%的合成数据，即可在遗忘质量和响应自然度上优于现有基线17.5%和16.3%，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: RULE不仅实现了目标遗忘，还提升了模型输出的自然度和训练效率，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了VISE基准，用于评估视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）在误导性用户输入下的迎合行为，并探索了通过关键帧选择减少这种偏差的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型在实际应用中需要多模态推理的可靠性，但迎合用户输入的行为（即使与视觉证据矛盾）影响了其可信度。目前缺乏针对视频语言领域的系统性评估。

Method: 提出VISE基准，评估Video-LLMs在不同问题格式、提示偏见和视觉推理任务中的迎合行为，并引入关键帧选择作为缓解策略。

Result: VISE首次将语言领域的迎合行为分析引入视觉领域，支持多类型迎合行为的细粒度分析。关键帧选择显示出通过增强视觉基础减少迎合偏差的潜力。

Conclusion: VISE填补了视频语言领域迎合行为评估的空白，为提升模型可靠性提供了新方向。

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

TL;DR: SDE-SQL框架通过动态生成和执行SQL探针，使大语言模型能在推理时自主探索数据库，显著提升Text-to-SQL任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态预处理的数据库信息，限制了模型对数据的理解能力。

Method: 提出SDE-SQL框架，通过生成和执行SQL探针动态获取数据库信息，无需依赖上下文示例。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，SDE-SQL比基线模型提升8.02%执行准确率，达到开源模型中的最佳水平。

Conclusion: SDE-SQL通过动态数据探索显著提升性能，且监督微调可进一步优化结果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TF-IDF的句子排序方法，用于长文档分类，显著减少输入大小和推理延迟，同时保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档分类中，BERT等模型因固定输入长度和二次注意力复杂度受限，且仅部分句子提供关键信息。

Method: 使用TF-IDF评分结合句子长度，提出固定数量或百分比句子选择策略。

Result: 在MahaNews LDC数据集上，输入大小减少50%以上，推理延迟降低43%，分类准确率仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明无需牺牲性能即可显著减少上下文，适用于实际长文档分类任务。

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究将信息论偏置归因评分方法应用于菲律宾语等黏着语言模型，发现菲律宾语模型的偏置主要由与人、物体和关系相关的词汇驱动，与英语模型的行为偏置主题（如犯罪、性和亲社会行为）形成对比。

Motivation: 探索语言模型在处理不同语言时的偏置行为差异，特别是针对黏着语言（如菲律宾语）的偏置归因方法。

Method: 通过信息论偏置归因评分方法，分析菲律宾语模型和三种多语言模型的偏置行为。

Result: 菲律宾语模型的偏置主要由与人、物体和关系相关的词汇驱动，与英语模型的行为偏置主题不同。

Conclusion: 英语和非英语模型在处理与社会人口群体相关的输入和偏置时存在差异。

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理动态知识时的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级框架来构建外部记忆以解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于预训练数据，无法适应实时信息的变化，而重新训练或上下文学习（ICL）成本高且不实用。

Method: 引入两个新基准（Temporal Wiki和Unified Clark），并提出一种轻量级框架，通过外部记忆增量组织知识。

Result: 该方法在基准测试中优于ICL和RAG基线，尤其在处理复杂推理或冲突事实时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了LLMs在处理动态知识时的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境下代码混合文本的句法分析挑战，现有解析器在多语言和混合语言输入中表现不佳。

Method: 开发基于提示的框架，结合少量样本LLM提示和专家审核，并发布两个标注数据集。

Result: BiLingua Parser在专家修订后达到95.29% LAS，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM在精心引导下可作为低资源代码混合环境下句法资源构建的实用工具。

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and
source code are available at https://github.com/N3mika/ParsingProject

Conclusion: 温度选择对模型性能至关重要，且温度效应在不同精度和量化模型中保持一致。

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

Result: 发现现有资源可能标注不足，桥接子类型标注一致性中等，但桥接实例识别一致性低。

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Conclusion: ConfQA和双神经知识框架有效减少幻觉并提升性能。

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Result: 发现模型间异质性、系统性不对称性、对提示框架的敏感性以及对高频令牌的过度估值。

Conclusion: 奖励模型可能编码偏见，不适合作为复杂人类价值观的代理，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

Motivation: 现有角色扮演方法主要依赖提示工程，但缺乏稳定性和可解释性。SRPS旨在通过操控模型内部特征来解决这些问题。

Method: SRPS提取角色扮演提示的潜在表示，基于激活模式选择最相关特征，并构建可注入模型残差流的控制向量。

Conclusion: SRPS通过操控内部特征增强了大语言模型的推理能力，同时提供了比传统方法更好的稳定性和可解释性。

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Motivation: 现有Finetuning-as-a-Service可能因用户数据中的有害提示导致LLM安全对齐性下降，而现有方法未能从根本上解决有害数据过滤问题。

Method: 利用安全对齐LLM中的拒绝特征区分有害与无害提示，训练ReFT模型作为教师模型，在微调时过滤有害数据并蒸馏对齐知识。

Result: 实验表明，ReFT策略显著减少有害输出，同时提高用户特定任务的微调准确性。

Conclusion: ReFT为Finetuning-as-a-Service提供了一种安全可靠的LLM部署解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究依赖BIRD数据集，但其假设用户具备专业知识和领域知识，且人工生成的证据存在缺陷，影响了模型性能。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider数据集上，SEED显著提高了无证据场景下的SQL生成准确性，甚至在某些情况下优于提供BIRD证据的设置。

Conclusion: SEED生成的证据不仅填补了研究与实际部署之间的差距，还提高了文本到SQL模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

### [90] [Conjoined Predication and Scalar Implicature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07429)
*Ratna Kandala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Magri (2016) 研究了一个关于连词的未解之谜，揭示了量化、集体/并发解释与上下文更新之间的隐藏互动。本文通过理论框架分析，认为这种不协调源于连词谓语的集体或并发解读，并指出标量含义的生成机制超出了基于穷尽化的语法许可理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Magri提出的第一个未解之谜，即某些连词句子的不协调现象，探索量化、集体/并发解释与上下文更新的互动。

Method: 通过理论框架分析，探讨连词谓语的集体或并发解读如何导致间接的上下文矛盾。

Result: 发现不协调源于集体或并发解读，标量含义的生成机制超出传统语法许可理论。

Conclusion: 标量含义的生成机制需要更广泛的语用解释，而不仅仅是基于穷尽化的语法许可。

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为弱到强解码（WSD）的新框架，通过小模型引导大模型生成对齐内容，解决了低资源下LLM对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）需要与人类偏好对齐以避免生成不当内容，但低资源方法在高质量和对齐内容之间仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出WSD框架，利用小型对齐模型生成对齐的开头，再由大型基础模型继续生成，并通过自动切换机制控制。

Result: 实验表明，WSD框架显著提升了基础模型的对齐能力，优于所有基线方法，且未影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: WSD是一种高效的低资源对齐方法，通过小模型引导大模型，实现了高质量和对齐内容的生成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文本嵌入模型在通用任务中的局限性，通过统一框架提升嵌入的泛化能力和性能。

Method: 基于Mistral-7B模型，结合上下文指令、软标签监督（来自高性能检索器）和自适应硬负样本挖掘，生成上下文感知嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB（v2）基准测试中表现优异，覆盖41个任务，排名靠前，优于更大或完全微调的基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合上下文提示、软监督和自适应采样，可高效生成高质量嵌入，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

Motivation: 现有主题建模模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，导致主题推断不稳定且不连贯。

Method: 通过共享编码器提取领域不变特征，使用专用解码器处理领域特定细节，并通过对抗性对齐选择性传递信息。

Result: DALTA在多种低资源数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了主题连贯性、稳定性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: DALTA框架有效解决了低资源主题建模的挑战，为领域自适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

Result: 实验表明，上下文支持能缩小知识差距，且难度、相关性和熟悉度等特征影响知识更新效果。

Conclusion: KScope框架能有效分类LLM知识状态，上下文特征分析和增强可信度可提升知识更新效果。

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

Conclusion: 建议采用更以用户为中心的方法改进LLM不确定性量化研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练数据集质量参差不齐，需要更高质量和多样化的数据来提升语言模型的性能，尤其是在数学和代码任务中。

Method: 提出两阶段去重、多分类器质量评分和领域感知流畅性过滤的数据处理流程，并提取了45亿条链式思维模板。

Result: 实验表明，基于CCI4.0预训练的模型在数学和代码任务中表现更优，数据质量和推理模板对模型性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 严格的数据处理和人类推理模板对提升语言模型性能具有重要作用，为自动处理预训练语料提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

Motivation: 公平性在多文档摘要中至关重要，因为不公正的摘要可能误导决策，例如过度代表负面评价。现有方法主要关注摘要级公平性，而忽略了语料库级公平性。

Method: FairPO通过扰动文档集生成偏好对以提升摘要级公平性，并通过动态调整偏好对权重以提升语料库级公平性。

Result: 实验表明，FairPO在保持摘要质量的同时优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FairPO有效平衡了摘要级和语料库级公平性，为多文档摘要提供了更全面的公平性解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单独使用语言模型时难以满足严格约束和全局优化的问题。

Method: 将输出视为基因，通过语言模型指导选择、交叉和变异等进化操作，迭代优化解决方案。

Result: 在行程规划、学术大纲和商业报告等任务中表现优异，生成结构良好且满足需求的结果。

Conclusion: GA LLM通过结合两种组件的优势，比单独使用语言模型更能满足约束并生成高质量解决方案。

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first

Conclusion: 通过新指标和DPO优化，显著提高了LLM解释与决策特征的一致性，为构建更可信的LLM提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

Motivation: 字节级回退虽能有效防止OOV，但在处理CJK语言和表情符号等字符多样场景时会显著增加序列长度，导致计算效率下降。

Method: 提出了一种简单的无损压缩技术。

Result: 该方法能够减少序列长度，同时保持无损。

Conclusion: 该技术为解决字节级回退带来的计算效率问题提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Conclusion: SELT无需任务特定微调，展示了强大的泛化能力，适用于多样化的推理任务。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application

with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some

Motivation: 解决低资源语言缺乏大规模指令数据集的问题，探索替代方案以提升模型性能。

Result: 目标语言语料库和指令调优模型显著提升性能，Llama 3.1 instruct 70B表现接近更大规模模型。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言场景下，合成指令和指令调优模型是有效的替代方案，且可扩展性强。

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文首次尝试将大语言模型（LLM）适配到乌克兰方言（Hutsul），通过构建平行语料库和词典，并利用RAG生成合成数据。微调后的7B模型在翻译任务中表现优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决乌克兰Hutsul方言这一低资源且形态复杂的语言处理问题。

Method: 构建平行语料库和词典，提出RAG生成合成数据，微调开源LLM（使用LoRA），并与GPT-4o对比。

Result: 微调的小模型（7B）在自动和LLM评估指标上均优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和微调，小模型也能在低资源方言任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoRMA的新方法，通过矩阵乘法变换替代传统的加法更新，解决了计算复杂性和秩瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP领域表现优异，但完全微调计算成本高。现有方法如LoRA采用加法更新，限制了性能。

Method: 提出LoRMA，将加法更新转变为矩阵乘法变换，通过操作重排序和秩膨胀策略优化计算。

Result: 实验证明LoRMA在多种评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRMA通过乘法变换提升了模型适应能力，为高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过细粒度标注教师意图是否能提升LLM在教育场景中的辅导响应质量，结果显示细粒度模型能生成更符合教学策略的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育应用（如智能辅导系统）中缺乏与教学策略的对齐，需任务特定适应。

Method: 使用MathDial数据集，应用自动化标注框架重新标注部分数据，细分为11种教学意图，并微调LLM。

Result: 细粒度模型生成的响应在教学对齐和效果上优于原始四分类模型。

Conclusion: 细粒度意图标注在教育场景的文本生成中具有重要价值，研究公开了标注数据和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在评估VLM生成的长段落描述的事实准确性时存在不足，缺乏细粒度错误检测和验证数据集。

Method: 开发了DOCCI-Critique基准（包含1,400个VLM生成的段落描述和10,216个句子级人工标注）和VNLI-Critique模型（用于自动化事实分类和错误分析）。

Result: VNLI-Critique在多个基准测试中表现优异（如M-HalDetect和CHOCOLATE），AutoRater与人类判断高度一致（Spearman 0.98），Critic-and-Revise流程显著提升描述准确性（46%增益）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关键基准和实用工具，显著提升了细粒度评估标准，推动了VLM图像理解的改进。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）在辅助同行评审时难以兼顾全面性和效率，因此需要一种更高效且深入的评审方法。

Method: TreeReview通过递归分解高层次问题为细粒度子问题，构建问题树，并通过动态问题扩展机制生成后续问题，最终从叶到根聚合答案生成评审。

Result: 实验表明，TreeReview在全面性和深度上优于基线方法，同时减少80%的LLM令牌使用。

Conclusion: TreeReview提供了一种高效且深入的论文评审方法，适用于生成全面且专家对齐的反馈。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are
available at https://github.com/YuanChang98/tree-review.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在低资源语言（如波兰语）中易受字符和词级攻击，导致预测结果大幅改变，揭示了其安全机制的潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多语言任务中表现优异，但安全训练数据主要集中于高资源语言（如英语），导致低资源语言中的安全漏洞未被充分评估。

Method: 通过少量字符修改和小型代理模型计算词重要性，构建低成本攻击方法，并在波兰语中验证其有效性。

Result: 字符和词级攻击显著改变了LLMs的预测结果，表明其内部安全机制存在可被绕过的漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在低资源语言中的安全风险，并提供了数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Motivation: 构建高质量的日语TTS数据集需要准确的音素和韵律标注，传统方法依赖纯文本或音频，效果有限。

Result: 客观评估显示方法优于传统方法；主观评估表明合成语音自然度接近人工标注。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成高质量标注，适用于日语TTS数据集构建。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中领域特定基准测试的可靠性和领域适应过程中知识表示的挑战。

Method: 使用TF和Term TF-IDF方法生成领域特定关键词和相关词列表，构建提示-目标对，评估模型完成这些提示的能力。

Result: 实验表明，该基准测试与专家生成的基准测试强相关，且比传统困惑度指标更准确地衡量领域知识。揭示了领域适应在小模型中快速发生（500步内），并展示了训练中基础模型领域知识评估的新方法。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的领域特定语言模型评估方法，并揭示了适应过程中知识表示的新见解，对更高效的微调策略和减轻灾难性遗忘的针对性方法具有启示。

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成数学推理数据集时存在质量和复杂度问题，需要改进。

Result: 构建了39K问题和6.1K高难度基准测试，验证了数据有效性，并发现模型性能随推理长度下降。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和数据集有助于提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AutoMod在实时互动平台（如Twitch）中审核仇恨内容的有效性，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过创建测试账户，使用Twitch API发送超过107,000条仇恨内容评论，评估AutoMod的标记准确性。

Result: AutoMod漏检高达94%的仇恨内容，但对含敏感词的良性内容误删率达89.5%。

Conclusion: AutoMod依赖敏感词而非上下文，审核能力存在重大缺陷，需改进上下文理解。

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Motivation: 当前LLM在生成RAG答案时存在过度概括或未能正确识别相关基础信息的问题，需要更精细的评估工具。

Method: 构建包含2366个多样化问题的基准测试，标注超过35K段落，涵盖私有文档和网页内容，以模拟真实场景。

Result: 评估显示，LLM倾向于过度概括而非严格基于相关段落生成答案，且在面对时间敏感或稀疏基础信息时表现更差。

Conclusion: GaRAGe为评估LLM在RAG任务中的表现提供了有效工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE训练方法主要针对基础模型，应用于指令模型时重构质量和可解释性下降，需要一种专门针对指令模型的优化方法。

Method: 提出FAST方法，通过调整训练过程以匹配指令模型的数据分布和激活模式，优化SAE性能。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上，FAST的均方误差为0.6468，显著优于基线方法；在Llama3.2-3B-Instruct上，高质量特征比例达21.1%。

Conclusion: FAST不仅提升了SAE在指令模型上的性能，还发现通过干预特殊令牌激活可改善输出质量，为模型行为精细控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

TL;DR: 研究发现，小语言模型（SLMs）在长链思维（CoT）监督训练中会出现性能显著下降的现象，称为长CoT退化。实验表明，这种现象普遍存在，且错误积累是主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨长CoT训练对小语言模型的影响，揭示其性能下降的原因。

Method: 在Qwen2.5、LLaMA3和Gemma3等模型上进行实验，分析长CoT训练对性能的影响。

Result: 小模型在长CoT训练中性能显著下降，甚至无法通过大量数据恢复。错误积累是主要原因。

Conclusion: 长CoT训练对小模型可能有害，需谨慎使用，并提出改进建议。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC
annotation across languages and promotes more consistent evaluation in
multilingual settings. The complete codebase and annotation tools can be

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种新的瑞士议会语料库长文本版本，通过结合Whisper Large-v3和GPT-4o的修正流程，显著提升了语音-文本对齐的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决瑞士德语辩论会议中语音识别和文本对齐的挑战，特别是低资源领域语料库的质量问题。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-v3进行初步转录，再通过两步骤的GPT-4o修正（命名实体修正和语义完整性评估），并结合数据驱动过滤。

Result: 最终语料库包含801小时音频，其中751小时通过质量控制，相比原始版本BLEU分数提高了6分。

Conclusion: 结合ASR、LLM修正和数据过滤的方法，显著提升了低资源领域语音语料库的质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习（RL）促进抽象推理的方法（AbstraL），以应对大语言模型（LLMs）在分布变化中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模LLMs在面对分布变化（如数值或名义变量变化、干扰性条款插入）时推理能力下降的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）而非监督微调，通过抽象化推理问题来提升模型的鲁棒性，并与符号工具结合。

Result: AbstraL方法显著减轻了在GSM扰动基准测试中的性能下降。

Conclusion: 抽象化推理问题并通过RL学习，能有效提升LLMs在面对分布变化时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM（大语言模型）遗忘技术的局限性，提出Form-Dependent Bias问题，并引入ORT基准和ROCR方法以提升遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法在实际场景中效果有限，无法泛化到同一知识的不同表达形式，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 提出Form-Dependent Bias问题，设计ORT基准评估遗忘方法的鲁棒性，并提出ROCR方法，通过重定向概念实现快速遗忘。

Result: 实验表明ROCR显著优于传统方法，能高效且自然地实现遗忘。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘需独立于表达形式，ROCR为解决这一问题提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习中伪标签选择和加权的问题，提高模型在数据不平衡情况下的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用三重重伪标签加权模块，结合头部一致性、自适应阈值和平均伪边际技术。

Result: 在5个NLP数据集的10个设置中，9个达到最优性能，并在数据不平衡情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: MultiMatch是一种高效且鲁棒的半监督学习方法，特别适用于文本分类任务。

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Conclusion: WebUIBench为MLLM在Web开发中的能力评估提供了系统性工具，有助于指导模型改进。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaF的两阶段框架，通过干预推理来减少LLMs中的注意力分散问题，提升推理和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文推理和生成中容易受到干扰模式的误导，导致推理准确性下降。作者认为这是训练数据中的虚假相关性所致，需要解决。

Method: LeaF框架分为两阶段：1）通过梯度比较识别干扰标记；2）在蒸馏过程中剪除这些标记，以对齐学生和教师的注意力分布。

Result: 实验表明，LeaF在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提升性能，并有效抑制了对干扰标记的注意力。

Conclusion: LeaF通过干预推理解决了LLMs中的注意力分散问题，提升了模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在终身模型编辑中存在泛化能力下降、编辑干扰或无法扩展的问题，需要一种高效可靠的编辑方法。

Method: 通过样本依赖的掩码稀疏化输入激活，将每个编辑限制在记忆参数的不同子集，减少编辑间的干扰。推理时通过稀疏激活模式匹配相关编辑。

Result: 在问答、幻觉纠正和分布外泛化等任务中，MEMOIR在可靠性、泛化能力和局部性指标上达到最佳性能，支持数千次顺序编辑且遗忘最少。

Conclusion: MEMOIR为语言模型的终身编辑提供了一种高效、可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基QNLP技术在高效可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效比较LLM输出的变化，尤其是在随机性和计算复杂性限制下，需要一种新的分析框架。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛采样在低维语义相似空间中构建经验分布，将问题转化为频率假设检验。

Result: 框架具有模型无关性、支持任意输入扰动、提供可解释的p值和标量效应大小，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM审计提供了一个可靠的频率假设检验方法，适用于多种扰动分析场景。

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现代语言模型通过确定性分词器（如字节对编码）将字符字符串的概率分布表示为（更短的）标记字符串的分布。然而，当前方法存在非规范标记编码的问题，导致模型分配了不必要的概率质量。本文提出两种方法强制规范标记字符串，提高了模型的似然性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在标记化过程中会分配概率质量给大量非规范标记编码，这些编码虽然能解码为有效字符字符串，但实际不会出现在训练数据中，既错误又浪费资源。

Method: 提出两种方法：(1) 通过条件推理在测试时强制规范标记字符串；(2) 通过模型参数化在训练时保证规范输出。

Result: 实验表明，修正规范性问题能显著提高多个模型和语料库的似然性能。

Conclusion: 强制规范标记字符串能有效避免概率质量的错误分配，提升语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同LLMs是否因多样性而真正存在差异，缺乏实证证据。

Method: 对350多个LLMs进行大规模评估，使用两个排行榜和一个简历筛选任务。

Result: 模型错误高度相关，60%的错误情况下模型一致；共享架构和提供商是主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 错误相关性影响下游任务，如LLM评估和招聘，反映了算法单一化的理论预测。

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

Motivation: 传统语言模型预训练依赖大量标注数据，而RPT旨在利用无标注文本数据，通过强化学习提升模型的推理能力。

Result: RPT显著提升了语言模型的下一个词预测准确性，并为后续强化微调提供了强大的预训练基础。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效且有前景的语言模型预训练扩展范式，其性能随计算资源增加而持续提升。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

*Hudson de Martim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于FRBRoo框架的细粒度时间模型，用于跟踪法律规范的层级组件（如条款、段落）的历时演变，解决了现有框架在组件级版本控制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律文档建模框架（如FRBR/FRBRoo和Akoma Ntoso）缺乏对细粒度组件级版本控制的支持，限制了法律文本在特定时间点的确定性重构能力，这对法律技术和AI应用的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 扩展FRBRoo框架，引入Temporal Version (TV)和Language Version (LV)子类，以及Component Work (CW)、Component Temporal Version (CTV)和Component Language Version (CLV)等概念，以分层方式跟踪法律规范的演变。

Result: 通过巴西联邦宪法的案例研究，展示了模型如何精确记录每个修正案对条款的影响，并支持特定时间点的法律文本重构。

Conclusion: 该模型为开发高级法律信息系统、知识图谱和AI工具提供了坚实基础，能够克服当前生成模型的局限性，实现准确的历史分析和影响评估。

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

*Yitao Liu,Chenglei Si,Karthik Narasimhan,Shunyu Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Contextual Experience Replay (CER)的无训练框架，通过动态记忆缓冲区积累和综合过去经验，帮助LLM代理在复杂任务中自我提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在复杂任务中缺乏环境特定经验，且无法在推理时持续学习，限制了其适应性。

Method: CER通过动态记忆缓冲区积累环境动态和决策模式，使代理能在新任务中检索相关知识。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena基准测试中，CER分别达到31.9%和36.7%的成功率，相对GPT-4o基线提升51.0%。

Conclusion: CER有效提升了LLM代理在复杂环境中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

*Clément Hongler,Andrew Emil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）概率测量的任务框架——交叉熵（Xent）游戏，用于评估LLMs的能力，并通过进化动力学探索其空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何通过概率测量隐含知识，并扩展其任务范围，超越生成性采样。

Method: 提出Xent游戏框架，包括单人和多人游戏，基于交叉熵分数和约束，构建为计算图和程序。

Result: Xent游戏空间足够丰富，包含多种有趣示例，并通过游戏理论一致性公理构建。

Conclusion: Xent游戏可作为LLMs能力的基准测试，并通过进化动力学方法解决无限范围问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种元学习方法，通过软提示和注意力映射模块改进小规模多模态模型的少样本学习能力，优于传统上下文学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中表现不稳定，尤其是小规模模型，可能因图像嵌入中的冗余信息而受影响。

Method: 提出元学习方法，利用任务相关图像特征蒸馏的软提示和注意力映射模块，支持少样本任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上的评估显示，该方法优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，尤其在图像扰动下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态模型在少样本任务中的适应和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在行为幻觉问题，影响其可靠性和扩展性，但相关研究较少。

Method: SHE框架通过两阶段方法（视觉-文本对齐检查和正交投影）检测和缓解行为幻觉，并提出自适应时间窗口和新指标BEACH。

Result: 实验表明，SHE在BEACH指标上将行为幻觉降低了10%以上，同时保持描述准确性。

Conclusion: SHE有效解决了行为幻觉问题，为多模态模型的可靠性提供了新方法。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Motivation: 当前代理框架在安全信息流、可靠性和多代理协调方面缺乏机制，SAFEFLOW旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明，SAFEFLOW代理在敌对环境中仍能保持高性能和安全性，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW和SAFEFLOWBENCH为可靠、安全的代理生态系统奠定了基础，推动了可靠自主性的前沿。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代LLMs是否具备解决传统AI中视为无解的框架问题和符号接地问题的认知能力。

Method: 设计两个基准任务，零样本条件下测试13种LLMs（开源和封闭模型），评估输出质量。

Result: 开源模型表现参差不齐，而部分封闭模型表现稳定且高分。

Conclusion: 某些现代LLMs可能具备解决长期理论挑战的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LUCIFER框架通过结合分层决策架构、强化学习和大型语言模型，解决了动态环境中自主决策的上下文偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中，先验知识与现实环境的快速变化导致决策效率低下，而人类上下文知识的整合仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出LUCIFER框架，结合分层决策、强化学习和LLMs，LLMs扮演上下文提取器和探索引导者双重角色。

Result: LUCIFER在探索效率和决策质量上优于传统方法，展示了上下文驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: LUCIFER为自主系统整合人类上下文知识提供了有效途径，提升了动态环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

Result: 顶级LLMs在逐步审查下的准确率低于10%，揭示了其推理链的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 模型规模和计算资源的增加对证明正确性提升有限，未来研究方向包括定理引导推理和自我优化。

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）在图像-文本对齐上表现不佳，且需要外部监督。本文旨在通过自监督方法解决这一问题。

Method: 基于理解与生成是逆对偶任务的观察，设计了自监督双奖励机制，通过反转输入-输出对计算双似然作为自我奖励进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需外部监督即可显著提升模型性能，尤其在文本到图像任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 自监督双奖励机制有效增强了多模态模型的理解与生成能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

Motivation: 现有对话AI测试仅模拟单控制环境，而实际场景（如技术支持）中用户需主动参与修改共享世界状态。

Method: 1) 提出电信双控制领域模型；2) 设计组合任务生成器；3) 开发可靠用户模拟器；4) 通过多维度分析评估性能。

Result: 实验显示，从无用户到双控制时，AI性能显著下降，突显引导用户的挑战。

Conclusion: $	au^2$-bench为需要有效推理和引导用户的AI提供了可控测试平台。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，SIGMA调优的7B模型仅用30K样本达到54.92%准确率，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: SIGMA通过利用非最优分支中的信息，显著提升模型推理能力并减少数据需求。

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

Result: 在文本游戏环境中验证了WorldLLM的有效性，提高了预测准确性并生成可解释的理论。

Conclusion: WorldLLM通过迭代优化和探索，显著提升了LLM在结构化环境中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ILP中，假设空间的搜索效率直接影响学习速度，通过预缩减假设空间可以避免无效搜索，提升整体性能。

Method: 利用背景知识识别并排除不可能出现在最优假设中的规则（如“偶数不可能是奇数”），通过答案集编程实现假设空间的缩减。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉推理和游戏等领域显著减少学习时间（从10小时降至2秒），同时保持预测准确性。

Conclusion: 预缩减假设空间是一种有效提升ILP效率的方法，尤其适用于复杂领域。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique
properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events,
and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the
influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DRL代理行为的复杂性需要超越简单的奖励曲线比较，但目前缺乏标准的行为分析方法。

Method: 在ForageWorld环境中，结合神经科学和动物行为学工具，对DRL代理进行行为和神经联合分析。

Result: 研究发现，基于RNN的无模型DRL代理可以通过涌现动态表现出类似规划的结构化行为，无需显式记忆模块或世界模型。

Conclusion: 通过借鉴生物智能研究方法，可以揭示DRL代理学习动态中的丰富结构，为未来复杂代理的行为分析和安全对齐提供框架。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

Motivation: 现有HGNN攻击方法需要复杂参数重训练，无法快速适应新场景，而基础模型为通用攻击提供了可能。

Result: 实验显示HeTa具有强大的攻击性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HeTa能够快速适应新异构图，为HGNNs的安全性评估提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法无法突破基础模型的局限性，无法学习新知识，而SFT能补充这一不足。因此，结合两者的优势成为研究动机。

Method: 提出ReLIFT方法，交替使用RL和在线微调（SFT），在遇到困难问题时收集高质量解决方案进行微调。

Result: ReLIFT在五个竞赛级基准和一个分布外基准上平均提升5.2分，且仅需13%的详细演示数据。

Conclusion: ReLIFT克服了RL的局限性，展示了显著潜力，为LLM推理能力的提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

Conclusion: 语义时空模型及其承诺理论有助于理解吸收态与边界信息的关联，为意图性引入提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

Motivation: 现有AutoML平台依赖单一优化策略，仅探索部分可行超参数配置，限制了性能提升。

Result: 在180个实验中，Gradients以82.8%胜率优于HuggingFace AutoTrain，并在复杂任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 经济驱动的竞争性方法能系统性发现集中式AutoML遗漏的优越配置。

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction
of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce
Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,
economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior
configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

TL;DR: DISRetrieval是一种基于语言篇章结构的层次检索框架，通过利用修辞结构理论（RST）和自适应摘要技术，显著提升了长文档理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能捕捉文档的篇章结构，而人类理解长文档时依赖这种结构，因此需要一种新的框架来结合语言学信息。

Method: DISRetrieval采用三个创新：1）基于RST的文档组织框架；2）结合LLM的节点表示技术；3）层次证据检索机制。

Result: 在QASPER和QuALITY数据集上，DISRetrieval在检索指标和问答任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合篇章结构能有效提升长文档理解的检索效果，验证了语言学信息的重要性。

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

Result: 在真实营销数据上优于传统A/B测试、上下文赌博机和基准强化学习方法。

Conclusion: RL-LLM-ABTest框架为个性化营销提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety
reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board

embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic
modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of

as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the
advantages of modern transformer based approaches in analyzing complex aviation
datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in
aviation safety. Future work will explore hybrid models, multilingual datasets,
and advanced clustering techniques to further improve topic modelling in this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融领域的应用中存在性能不足和资源消耗高的问题，尤其是在判别任务、生成任务和主题建模中表现不佳。

Method: FinBERT2基于32b标记的高质量金融语料进行预训练，并开发了Fin-Labelers（判别任务）、Fin-Retrievers（检索任务）和Fin-TopicModel（主题建模）等变体。

Result: FinBERT2在金融分类任务中平均优于其他BERT变体和LLMs，检索任务中优于开源和专有嵌入模型，主题建模任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: FinBERT2为金融领域的LLMs应用提供了更高效的解决方案，并通过比较分析展示了其在金融NLP中的实用性。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

Result: 在真实电商数据集上，召回率提升12%，命中率提升9%，用户覆盖率提升15%。

Conclusion: LLM在解析产品内容和用户意图方面具有潜力，为未来电商推荐系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: As e-commerce platforms expand their product catalogs, accurately
recommending long-tail items becomes increasingly important for enhancing both
user experience and platform revenue. A key challenge is the long-tail problem,
where extreme data sparsity and cold-start issues limit the performance of
traditional recommendation methods. To address this, we propose a novel
long-tail product recommendation mechanism that integrates product text
descriptions and user behavior sequences using a large-scale language model
(LLM). First, we introduce a semantic visor, which leverages a pre-trained LLM
to convert multimodal textual content such as product titles, descriptions, and
user reviews into meaningful embeddings. These embeddings help represent
item-level semantics effectively. We then employ an attention-based user intent
encoder that captures users' latent interests, especially toward long-tail
items, by modeling collaborative behavior patterns. These components feed into
a hybrid ranking model that fuses semantic similarity scores, collaborative
filtering outputs, and LLM-generated recommendation candidates. Extensive
experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show that our method outperforms
baseline models in recall (+12%), hit rate (+9%), and user coverage (+15%).
These improvements lead to better exposure and purchase rates for long-tail
products. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs in interpreting product
content and user intent, offering a promising direction for future e-commerce
recommendation systems.

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建高质量阿拉伯语RAG管道提供了关键见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

Conclusion: NR4DER通过神经重排序和序列增强，显著提升了习题推荐的准确性和多样性，适应了学生的个性化学习需求。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing
number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving
student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,

*Antonio Pariente,Ignacio Hounie,Santiago Segarra,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用q-度量空间中的度量树来优化向量搜索的方法，通过投影将任意距离度量嵌入到q-度量空间，从而减少比较次数并提升搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量搜索算法忽略了向量嵌入的度量结构，未能充分利用其潜在特性。

Method: 提出一种投影方法，将向量数据集嵌入到q-度量空间，并学习近似投影以高效转换查询点。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使经典度量树算法在高维数据中表现优异，与最先进搜索方法竞争。

Conclusion: 通过利用q-度量空间的特性，可以显著提升向量搜索的效率与性能。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search
algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a
constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we
demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger
version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search.
Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic.
Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets
with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving
the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection
to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances
satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image
vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic
metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional
data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search
methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: OneSug是一个端到端的生成式框架，用于电子商务查询建议，通过统一查询建议过程并优化用户偏好，显著提升了搜索体验和商业转化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多阶段查询建议模块因优化目标不一致导致效率低下和性能不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: OneSug结合了前缀增强模块、编码器-解码器生成模型和奖励加权排名策略，统一了查询建议过程。

Result: 在大规模行业数据集上验证了OneSug的有效性和效率，并在快手平台部署后显著提升了点击率、订单量和收入。

Conclusion: OneSug通过端到端框架解决了传统方法的局限性，展示了在电子商务搜索中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Query suggestion plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience in
e-commerce search systems by providing relevant query recommendations that
align with users' initial input. This module helps users navigate towards
personalized preference needs and reduces typing effort, thereby improving
search experience. Traditional query suggestion modules usually adopt
multi-stage cascading architectures, for making a well trade-off between system
response time and business conversion. But they often suffer from
inefficiencies and suboptimal performance due to inconsistent optimization
objectives across stages. To address these, we propose OneSug, the first
end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce query suggestion. OneSug
incorporates a prefix2query representation enhancement module to enrich
prefixes using semantically and interactively related queries to bridge content
and business characteristics, an encoder-decoder generative model that unifies
the query suggestion process, and a reward-weighted ranking strategy with
behavior-level weights to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSug's ability for
effective and efficient query suggestion. Furthermore, OneSug has been
successfully deployed for the entire traffic on the e-commerce search engine in
Kuaishou platform for over 1 month, with statistically significant improvements
in user top click position (-9.33%), CTR (+2.01%), Order (+2.04%), and Revenue
(+1.69%) over the online multi-stage strategy, showing great potential in
e-commercial conversion.

*Md Aminul Islam,Kathryn Vasilaky,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于控制函数的两阶段方法，用于纠正隐式反馈数据中的位置偏差，无需依赖点击或倾向模型，且适用于非线性排名模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式反馈数据（如用户点击）在LTR系统中广泛使用，但存在位置偏差等问题，直接训练会导致次优排名性能。

Method: 采用两阶段控制函数方法，第一阶段利用排名过程的残差外生变量纠正第二阶段点击方程中的位置偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在纠正位置偏差方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于任何先进排名算法，并提出了验证点击去偏技术以优化模型选择。

Abstract: Implicit feedback data, such as user clicks, is commonly used in
learning-to-rank (LTR) systems because it is easy to collect and it often
reflects user preferences. However, this data is prone to various biases, and
training an LTR system directly on biased data can result in suboptimal ranking
performance. One of the most prominent and well-studied biases in implicit
feedback data is position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to
interact with higher-ranked documents regardless of their true relevance. In
this paper, we propose a novel control function-based method that accounts for
position bias in a two-stage process. The first stage uses exogenous variation
from the residuals of the ranking process to correct for position bias in the
second stage click equation. Unlike previous position bias correction methods,
our method does not require knowledge of the click or propensity model and
allows for nonlinearity in the underlying ranking model. Moreover, our method
is general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by
plugging it into the second stage. We also introduce a technique to debias
validation clicks for hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model in the
absence of unbiased validation data. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in correcting for position bias.

*Amit Jaspal,Qian Dang,Ajantha Ramineni*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RADAR框架通过异步离线计算提升推荐系统的召回率，显著提高推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模推荐系统的初始检索阶段难以从海量内容中精准识别高相关性和高吸引力项目。

Method: 引入RADAR框架，利用异步离线计算预排更大候选集，绕过在线检索和预排阶段。

Result: 离线实验显示RADAR召回率提升2倍，在线A/B测试验证了0.8%的参与度提升。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种在严格在线服务约束下提升推荐质量的实用有效方法。

Abstract: Modern large-scale recommender systems employ multi-stage ranking funnel
(Retrieval, Pre-ranking, Ranking) to balance engagement and computational
constraints (latency, CPU). However, the initial retrieval stage, often relying
on efficient but less precise methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), struggles
to effectively surface the most engaging items from billion-scale catalogs,
particularly distinguishing highly relevant and engaging candidates from merely
relevant ones. We introduce Recall Augmentation through Deferred Asynchronous
Retrieval (RADAR), a novel framework that leverages asynchronous, offline
computation to pre-rank a significantly larger candidate set for users using
the full complexity ranking model. These top-ranked items are stored and
utilized as a high-quality retrieval source during online inference, bypassing
online retrieval and pre-ranking stages for these candidates. We demonstrate
through offline experiments that RADAR significantly boosts recall (2X
Recall@200 vs DNN retrieval baseline) by effectively combining a larger
retrieved candidate set with a more powerful ranking model. Online A/B tests
confirm a +0.8% lift in topline engagement metrics, validating RADAR as a
practical and effective method to improve recommendation quality under strict
online serving constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究资源共享和元数据异构性导致研究可重复性和方法查找困难，需要一种机器可操作的解决方案。

Result: 总结了RKG的不同实现、构建方法及其在规模、模式和可靠性上的差异。

Conclusion: RKG为研究资源共享提供了结构化解决方案，但面临多样化的应用和挑战。

Abstract: Sharing and reusing research artifacts, such as datasets, publications, or
methods is a fundamental part of scientific activity, where heterogeneity of
resources and metadata and the common practice of capturing information in
unstructured publications pose crucial challenges. Reproducibility of research
and finding state-of-the-art methods or data have become increasingly
challenging. In this context, the concept of Research Knowledge Graphs (RKGs)
has emerged, aiming at providing an easy to use and machine-actionable
representation of research artifacts and their relations. That is facilitated
through the use of established principles for data representation, the
consistent adoption of globally unique persistent identifiers and the reuse and
linking of vocabularies and data. This paper provides the first
conceptualisation of the RKG vision, a categorisation of in-use RKGs together
with a description of RKG building blocks and principles. We also survey
real-world RKG implementations differing with respect to scale, schema, data,
used vocabulary, and reliability of the contained data. We also characterise
different RKG construction methodologies and provide a forward-looking
perspective on the diverse applications, opportunities, and challenges
associated with the RKG vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行搜索引擎需要用户从目的地开始并编辑搜索参数，限制了用户体验。

Method: 结合领域特定的多任务优化、不对称密集检索架构和图像处理技术。

Result: 在四个测试集上显著优于现有模型，如MARVEL（0.681 vs. 0.603）。

Conclusion: HotelMatch-LLM在多任务优化、通用性和可扩展性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its
scalability for processing large image galleries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法主要依赖基于相似性的检索，未能充分利用用户-物品交互中的丰富关系结构。

Method: 扩展LlamaRec架构，引入轻量级用户偏好模块，动态识别异构知识图谱中的关键关系路径，并将其整合到Llama-2模型的提示中。

Result: 在ML-100K和Amazon Beauty数据集上，LlamaRec-LKG-RAG在MRR、NDCG和Recall等关键排序指标上显著优于LlamaRec。

Conclusion: LlamaRec-LKG-RAG证明了结构化推理在基于LLM的推荐中的重要性，为下一代知识感知的个性化推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的持续学习推荐模型CSTRec，通过线性注意力机制CSA解决数据流更新中的计算成本和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在持续更新的非平稳数据流上存在计算成本高或灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出CSTRec模型，核心是CSA机制，包含Cauchy-Schwarz归一化和协作兴趣池，并支持冷启动用户学习。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CSTRec在知识保留和获取方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSTRec通过CSA机制有效平衡历史与当前兴趣，提升了持续学习推荐性能。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models based on the Transformer architecture show
superior performance in harnessing long-range dependencies within user behavior
via self-attention. However, naively updating them on continuously arriving
non-stationary data streams incurs prohibitive computation costs or leads to
catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Continual Sequential
Transformer for Recommendation (CSTRec) that effectively leverages
well-preserved historical user interests while capturing current interests. At
its core is Continual Sequential Attention (CSA), a linear attention mechanism
that retains past knowledge without direct access to old data. CSA integrates
two key components: (1) Cauchy-Schwarz Normalization that stabilizes training
under uneven interaction frequencies, and (2) Collaborative Interest Enrichment
that mitigates forgetting through shared, learnable interest pools. We further
introduce a technique that facilitates learning for cold-start users by
transferring historical knowledge from behaviorally similar existing users.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets indicate that CSTRec
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both knowledge retention and
acquisition.

TL;DR: MoE-MLoRA是一种基于专家混合的框架，通过动态加权专家贡献提升多领域推荐系统的性能，尤其在动态数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如MLoRA）在跨领域用户行为处理上缺乏灵活性，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出MoE-MLoRA框架，独立训练专家后通过门控网络动态加权其贡献。

Result: 在动态数据集（如Taobao-20）上性能提升显著（+1.45 Weighed-AUC），但在低多样性数据集上效果有限。

Conclusion: 专家混合架构在多领域推荐系统中潜力巨大，需任务感知和自适应门控以提升复杂环境下的预测准确性。

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

TL;DR: CellCLIP是一种用于高内涵筛选数据的跨模态对比学习框架，通过改进图像编码和扰动表示，显著提升了性能并减少了计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高内涵筛选技术（如Cell Painting）能够大规模研究细胞形态对扰动的响应，但现有方法难以处理其图像语义差异和扰动类型的多样性。

Method: CellCLIP结合预训练图像编码器、新型通道编码方案和自然语言编码器，以统一潜在空间对齐扰动及其形态效应。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和生物学相关任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为高内涵筛选数据提供了一种高效的跨模态对比学习解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

TL;DR: Mutual-Taught是一种自训练方法，通过迭代优化策略模型（PM）和奖励模型（RM）来解决分布偏移问题，无需额外人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型（LLM）的偏好优化中，新生成的模型样本与奖励模型训练数据之间的分布偏移会降低RM效果，进而影响PM性能。

Method: 采用类似期望最大化（EM）算法的自训练方法：E步用当前RM反馈更新PM，M步用PM输出更新RM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法持续提升模型性能，8B策略模型在AlpacaEval-2上胜率为54.1%，8B奖励模型性能与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught通过迭代优化PM和RM，有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate

and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and

Conclusion: GLProtein通过整合全局和局部结构信息，为蛋白质功能预测提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）虽然具有潜力，但推理延迟高，且传统加速技术不适用。

Method: 提出dLLM-Cache框架，利用静态提示和部分动态响应的特点，通过缓存和部分更新优化推理效率。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B等模型上，dLLM-Cache实现了高达9.1倍的加速，且不损失输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache显著降低了dLLMs的推理延迟，使其接近自回归模型的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN在准确性和收敛速度上优于传统DGCNN，且参数高效。

Conclusion: 高多项式阶数不一定提升性能，需进一步研究多项式基与图学习机制的交互。

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

*Bozhi Sun,Seda Tierney,Jeffrey A. Feinstein,Frederick Damen,Alison L. Marsden,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散事件随机模拟和强化学习的动态资源分配策略，用于优化医院超声心动图检查的调度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院超声心动图检查调度面临非确定性因素（如患者爽约、到达时间、检查时长等）和资源不对称约束的挑战。

Method: 通过预处理操作数据估计患者爽约概率和检查时间分布，构建SimPy离散事件模拟模型，并与Gymnasium库集成，比较动态分配与预留策略，应用强化学习优化策略。

Result: 动态分配策略在适应患者变异性和资源约束方面表现更优，强化学习策略进一步提升了效率。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的动态资源管理可显著提升超声实验室效率。

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

*Daniel Halpern,Evi Micha,Ariel D. Procaccia,Itai Shapira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多奖励函数分布的方法，以反映多样化的用户偏好，避免多数信号压制少数观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法假设存在单一的理想行为，忽略了人类偏好的多样性。

Method: 通过从成对偏好中学习奖励函数分布，无需标注者标识或预定义群体。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能更准确地表示多样化偏好分布，校准效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法能更忠实地反映多元价值观。

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

TL;DR: LT-PINNs是一种新型的物理信息神经网络框架，通过参数化拓扑边界曲线，消除了手动插值的需求，并在复杂几何中实现了精确的边界确定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs依赖基于密度的拓扑描述，需要手动插值且难以处理复杂几何，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出LT-PINNs框架，通过可学习的参数化边界曲线，结合专门的边界条件和拓扑损失函数，实现精确边界表示。

Result: LT-PINNs在多种PDE问题中表现优异，显著降低了相对L2误差，并能处理任意边界条件。

Conclusion: LT-PINNs在工程优化中具有广泛应用潜力，尤其在复杂拓扑和边界条件下的表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless
tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal
topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on
density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and
limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose
Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for
boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control
variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs
eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary
determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss
function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary
representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of
LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs),
including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's
equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate
effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent
flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their
engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming
a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results
demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors
compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2)
LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a
wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries
without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在推理时是否能够表现出类似强化学习的行为，从而提升任务性能。

Method: 提出ICRL prompting框架，通过多轮提示和反馈（奖励信号）逐步优化LLM的响应。

Result: 在Game of 24、创意写作和ScienceWorld等基准测试中，ICRL prompting显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ICRL prompting为LLM在推理时实现类似强化学习的行为提供了新范式，具有扩展测试时计算的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

*Zilang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于五种集成学习方法的葡萄酒质量评估基准测试，通过泄漏优化流程和特征选择，发现Gradient Boosting在准确性上表现最佳，但推荐Random Forest作为性价比最高的生产模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 葡萄酒质量评估目前依赖主观且劳动密集的品鉴小组，需要更准确、可重复的自动化方法。

Method: 采用五种集成学习方法（Random Forest、Gradient Boosting、XGBoost、LightGBM、CatBoost），结合泄漏优化流程、特征选择和超参数搜索。

Result: Gradient Boosting在加权F1指标上表现最佳（红葡萄酒0.693，白葡萄酒0.664），但Random Forest在性价比上更优。

Conclusion: 推荐Random Forest作为生产模型，XGBoost和LightGBM为GPU高效替代方案，Gradient Boosting为离线基准测试的准确性上限。

Abstract: Accurate and reproducible wine-quality assessment is critical for production
control yet remains dominated by subjective, labour-intensive tasting panels.
We present the first unified benchmark of five ensemble learners (Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on the canonical Vinho
Verde red- and white-wine datasets (1,599 and 4,898 instances, 11
physicochemical attributes). Our leakage-free workflow employs an 80:20
stratified train-test split, five-fold StratifiedGroupKFold within the training
set, per-fold standardisation, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, inverse-frequency cost
weighting, Optuna hyper-parameter search (120-200 trials per model) and a
two-stage feature-selection refit. Final scores on untouched test sets are
reported with weighted F1 as the headline metric. Gradient Boosting achieves
the highest accuracy (weighted F1 0.693 +/- 0.028 for red and 0.664 +/- 0.016
for white), followed within three percentage points by Random Forest and
XGBoost. Limiting each model to its five top-ranked variables lowers
dimensionality by 55 percent while reducing weighted F1 by only 2.6 percentage
points for red and 3.0 percentage points for white, indicating that alcohol,
volatile acidity, sulphates, free SO2 and chlorides capture most predictive
signal. Runtime profiling on an EPYC 9K84/H20 node reveals a steep efficiency
gradient: Gradient Boosting averages 12 h per five-fold study, XGBoost and
LightGBM require 2-3 h, CatBoost 1 h, and Random Forest under 50 min. We
therefore recommend Random Forest as the most cost-effective production model,
XGBoost and LightGBM as GPU-efficient alternatives, and Gradient Boosting as
the accuracy ceiling for offline benchmarking. The fully documented pipeline
and metric set provide a reproducible baseline for future work on imbalanced
multi-class wine-quality prediction.

and trustworthy models has intensified. Despite the proliferation of local
explanation techniques, including SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual methods, there
exists no standardized, reproducible framework for their comparative
evaluation, particularly in fairness-sensitive settings.
  We introduce ExplainBench, an open-source benchmarking suite for systematic
evaluation of local model explanations across ethically consequential datasets.
ExplainBench provides unified wrappers for popular explanation algorithms,
integrates end-to-end pipelines for model training and explanation generation,
and supports evaluation via fidelity, sparsity, and robustness metrics. The
framework includes a Streamlit-based graphical interface for interactive
exploration and is packaged as a Python module for seamless integration into
research workflows.
  We demonstrate ExplainBench on datasets commonly used in fairness research,
such as COMPAS, UCI Adult Income, and LendingClub, and showcase how different
explanation methods behave under a shared experimental protocol. By enabling
reproducible, comparative analysis of local explanations, ExplainBench advances
the methodological foundations of interpretable machine learning and
facilitates accountability in real-world AI systems.

Motivation: 为了简化状态合并算法的实现，并支持多种自动机类型，AALpy提供了通用的红蓝框架实现。

Method: 通过统一的内部表示，实现了高度可配置的红蓝框架状态合并算法，用户只需定义兼容性标准和评分。

Result: 使用AALpy实现现有状态合并算法仅需少量代码，显著降低了实现复杂度。

Conclusion: AALpy为自动机学习提供了高效的工具，支持快速实现和测试状态合并算法。

Abstract: AALpy is a well-established open-source automata learning library written in
Python with a focus on active learning of systems with IO behavior. It provides
a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms for different automaton types
ranging from fully deterministic to probabilistic automata. In this work, we
present the recent addition of a generalized implementation of an important
method from the domain of passive automata learning: state-merging in the
red-blue framework. Using a common internal representation for different
automaton types allows for a general and highly configurable implementation of
the red-blue framework. We describe how to define and execute state-merging
algorithms using AALpy, which reduces the implementation effort for
state-merging algorithms mainly to the definition of compatibility criteria and
scoring. This aids the implementation of both existing and novel algorithms. In
particular, defining some existing state-merging algorithms from the literature
with AALpy only takes a few lines of code.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的联邦学习（FL）框架，优化客户端训练数据量以提升性能，同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中非独立同分布（non-IID）数据导致的性能下降问题，避免客户端过度共享数据。

Method: 利用DRL代理动态选择客户端训练数据量，以训练损失变化为奖励信号，优化数据分配策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和FL框架上验证了性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了non-IID数据的影响，提升了联邦学习的整体性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaborative model
training over large-scale distributed data, enabling higher performance while
maintaining client data privacy. However, the nature of model aggregation at
the centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of
non-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally
on more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all
clients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data
necessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the
server. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent
utilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize
the amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.
Specifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the
local performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for
each class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local
training. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized
partition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the
client utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its
performance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of
aggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL
clients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple
benchmark datasets and FL frameworks. Our code is available at

Result: 研究表明，GenAI（如LLMs）正在从高层规划到日常运营中增强决策能力，并推动Agentic Digital Twin的发展。

Conclusion: Transformer和LLMs为能源管理带来了新的可能性，Agentic Digital Twin则进一步整合了自主性和社交互动能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端事件（如市场崩溃、自然灾害等）罕见但破坏性大，数据稀缺导致传统数据驱动方法难以建模。合成数据生成成为解决方案，但现有研究缺乏针对极端事件的专门探讨。

Method: 系统回顾生成模型和大语言模型，特别是结合统计理论、特殊训练和采样机制的方法，以捕捉重尾分布。提出涵盖统计、依赖、视觉和任务导向指标的评估框架。

Result: 总结了基准数据集，分析了各指标在极端事件中的适用性，并分类了关键应用领域（如行为金融、野火等），指出未充分探索的方向。

Conclusion: 论文为极端事件合成数据研究提供了结构化基础，并提出了未来挑战，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Method: 通过函数逼近定义表达能力，使用Rademacher复杂度建立泛化界限，并提出基于正交函数（如小波和Legendre多项式）的新编码方法。

Result: 实验表明，基于正交变换的编码方法在泛化和外推方面优于传统的正弦编码。

Conclusion: 该研究为自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域的Transformer设计提供了理论依据和实用指导。

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

Result: CoxNTF在生存预测性能上与原始协变量的Coxnet相当，同时提供了结构化和可解释的聚类框架。

Conclusion: CoxNTF是一种强大的工具，能有效处理特征冗余，适用于生存分析的联合聚类和预测。

Abstract: The interpretation of the results of survival analysis often benefits from
latent factor representations of baseline covariates. However, existing
methods, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), do not incorporate
survival information, limiting their predictive power. We present CoxNTF, a
novel approach that uses non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to derive
meaningful latent representations that are closely associated with survival
outcomes. CoxNTF constructs a weighted covariate tensor in which survival
probabilities derived from the Coxnet model are used to guide the tensorization
process. Our results show that CoxNTF achieves survival prediction performance
comparable to using Coxnet with the original covariates, while providing a
structured and interpretable clustering framework. In addition, the new
approach effectively handles feature redundancy, making it a powerful tool for
joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式表示（如对象描述符或3D分割图）存在离散、易产生漏洞和噪声的问题，限制了新类别的发现能力。

Method: NeurNCD采用Embedding-NeRF模型和KL散度，结合特征查询、调制和聚类等组件，实现高效的语义嵌入和视觉嵌入空间信息交换。

Result: 在NYUv2和Replica数据集上，NeurNCD显著优于现有方法，无需密集标注数据或人工干预。

Conclusion: NeurNCD为开放世界类别发现提供了一种高效且数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Method: 对五种分子编码器进行分层分析，测试22种ADMET属性预测任务，比较固定嵌入和微调效果。

Result: 中间层嵌入平均提升5.4%，微调后平均提升8.5%，部分任务性能提升高达40.8%。

Conclusion: 充分利用分子编码器的全层表示可显著提升性能并提高计算效率。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型推理扩展方法SAFFRON，用于增强大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性，解决了传统方法在安全场景中的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全保证研究主要关注训练阶段的对齐，但易受越狱攻击；推理扩展虽提升了LLM的推理能力，但在安全保证方面尚未探索。

Method: 提出SAFFRON，引入多叉奖励模型（MRM）减少奖励模型评估次数，并结合部分监督训练目标、保守探索约束和Trie缓存策略。

Result: 实验验证了SAFFRON的有效性，并公开了模型Saffron-1和数据集Safety4M。

Conclusion: SAFFRON为LLM安全提供了高效解决方案，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有复杂的非线性动态，现有深度学习方法未能明确建模这些动态，因此需要一种新框架来填补这一空白。

Method: DeepEDM基于经验动态建模（EDM）和Takens定理，通过时间延迟嵌入学习潜在空间，使用核回归逼近动态，并利用软注意力机制实现高效预测。

Result: 实验表明，DeepEDM对输入噪声具有鲁棒性，并在合成数据和真实时间序列上的预测精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepEDM成功整合了非线性动力学建模与深度学习，为时间序列预测提供了一种高效且准确的新方法。

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics.
Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future
prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series
forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear
dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical
dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel
deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs
kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging
efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate
prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as
well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is
robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting
accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健的共识策略（如WISCA）能有效提高机器学习模型解释的可靠性。

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)
models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes
domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield
conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize
results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets
with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability
techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and
a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which
integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著提高了婴儿睡眠质量，同时保持了出行效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶中婴儿睡眠质量的优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving
comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep,
is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp
maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and
parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the
integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving
behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In
particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to
varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively
synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM)
and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the
relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse
traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the
wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data
from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving
aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control
strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and
overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution
significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while
preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is an essential task with wide real-world
applications across domains. While recent advances in deep learning have
enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains
considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as
series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying
conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level,
offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this
gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level.
TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of
individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons,
and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design
space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and
uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting
scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that
recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights. The
benchmark is available at: https://github.com/AdityaLab/TimeRecipe.

Conclusion: 该方法通过释放独立性假设并引入潜在变量建模，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) aim to provide personalized content, but they
face a challenge in unbiased learning due to selection bias, where users only
interact with items they prefer. This bias leads to a distorted representation
of user preferences, which hinders the accuracy and fairness of
recommendations. To address the issue, various methods such as error imputation
based, inverse propensity scoring, and doubly robust techniques have been
developed. Despite the progress, from the structural causal model perspective,
previous debiasing methods in RS assume the independence of the exogenous
variables. In this paper, we release this assumption and propose a learning
algorithm based on likelihood maximization to learn a prediction model. We
first discuss the correlation and difference between unmeasured confounding and
our scenario, then we propose a unified method that effectively handles latent
exogenous variables. Specifically, our method models the data generation
process with latent exogenous variables under mild normality assumptions. We
then develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically estimate the likelihood
function. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is at

Result: 理论保证和实验验证表明，该方法在隐私敏感场景中有效且可靠。

Conclusion: 提出的认证遗忘框架在无需原始数据的情况下，提供了强隐私保证和模型实用性。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of data privacy regulations, the ability to erase
private or copyrighted information from trained models has become a crucial
requirement. Traditional unlearning methods often assume access to the complete
training dataset, which is unrealistic in scenarios where the source data is no
longer available. To address this challenge, we propose a certified unlearning
framework that enables effective data removal \final{without access to the
original training data samples}. Our approach utilizes a surrogate dataset that
approximates the statistical properties of the source data, allowing for
controlled noise scaling based on the statistical distance between the two.
\updated{While our theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the exact
statistical distance, practical implementations typically approximate this
distance, resulting in potentially weaker but still meaningful privacy
guarantees.} This ensures strong guarantees on the model's behavior
post-unlearning while maintaining its overall utility. We establish theoretical
bounds, introduce practical noise calibration techniques, and validate our
method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in
privacy-sensitive settings.

Motivation: 传统影子模型攻击假设攻击者能访问与目标模型训练数据分布匹配的背景数据，但在现实中，攻击者可能无法访问某些子类数据。本文探讨了这种极端但现实的分布偏移情况下的攻击效果。

Method: 论文首先展示了影子模型攻击在这种情况下的性能急剧下降，随后提出并验证了分位数回归方法的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，分位数回归攻击在子类缺失情况下表现优异，例如在CIFAR-100上TPR提升11倍，在ImageNet上即使移除90%训练类仍能取得显著效果。

Conclusion: 分位数回归攻击在极端分布偏移下优于影子模型攻击，论文还通过理论模型分析了该方法的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Shadow model attacks are the state-of-the-art approach for membership
inference attacks on machine learning models. However, these attacks typically
assume an adversary has access to a background (nonmember) data distribution
that matches the distribution the target model was trained on. We initiate a
study of membership inference attacks where the adversary or auditor cannot
access an entire subclass from the distribution -- a more extreme but realistic
version of distribution shift than has been studied previously. In this
setting, we first show that the performance of shadow model attacks degrades
catastrophically, and then demonstrate the promise of another approach,
quantile regression, that does not have the same limitations. We show that
quantile regression attacks consistently outperform shadow model attacks in the
class dropout setting -- for example, quantile regression attacks achieve up to
11$\times$ the TPR of shadow models on the unseen class on CIFAR-100, and
achieve nontrivial TPR on ImageNet even with 90% of training classes removed.
We also provide a theoretical model that illustrates the potential and
limitations of this approach.

Result: AGF量化了特征学习的顺序、时间和幅度，验证了实验数据，并在多种网络中统一了现有分析。

Conclusion: AGF为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新视角，是理论进展的重要一步。

Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In
this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic
framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks
trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in
this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus
where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons
rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step
process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a
cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each
round, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and
a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these
drops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and
extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks
and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular
modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we
prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.
Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give
the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that
networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.
Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning
in neural networks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

Conclusion: 研究表明，动态调整正则化强度或减少每任务步数有助于提升连续学习的性能。

Abstract: We study realizable continual linear regression under random task orderings,
a common setting for developing continual learning theory. In this setup, the
worst-case expected loss after $k$ learning iterations admits a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/k)$. However, prior work using an unregularized scheme has only
established an upper bound of $O(1/k^{1/4})$, leaving a significant gap. Our
paper proves that this gap can be narrowed, or even closed, using two
frequently used regularization schemes: (1) explicit isotropic $\ell_2$
regularization, and (2) implicit regularization via finite step budgets. We
show that these approaches, which are used in practice to mitigate forgetting,
reduce to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on carefully defined surrogate
losses. Through this lens, we identify a fixed regularization strength that
yields a near-optimal rate of $O(\log k / k)$. Moreover, formalizing and
analyzing a generalized variant of SGD for time-varying functions, we derive an
increasing regularization strength schedule that provably achieves an optimal
rate of $O(1/k)$. This suggests that schedules that increase the regularization
coefficient or decrease the number of steps per task are beneficial, at least
in the worst case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the gap-dependent regret bounds for episodic MDPs. We show that
the Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP) algorithm achieves a variance-aware
gap-dependent regret bound of $$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0}
\frac{H^2 \log K \land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}
+\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)=0}\frac{ H^2 \land
\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_{\mathrm{min}}} + SAH^4 (S \lor H)
\right) \log K\right),$$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the number
of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
Here, $\Delta_h(s,a) =V_h^* (a) - Q_h^* (s, a)$ represents the suboptimality
gap and $\Delta_{\mathrm{min}} := \min_{\Delta_h (s,a) > 0} \Delta_h(s,a)$. The
term $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ denotes the maximum conditional total
variance, calculated as the maximum over all $(\pi, h, s)$ tuples of the
expected total variance under policy $\pi$ conditioned on trajectories visiting
state $s$ at step $h$. $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ characterizes the
maximum randomness encountered when learning any $(h, s)$ pair. Our result
stems from a novel analysis of the weighted sum of the suboptimality gap and
can be potentially adapted for other algorithms. To complement the study, we
establish a lower bound of $$\Omega \left( \sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0} \frac{H^2
\land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}\cdot \log K\right),$$
demonstrating the necessity of dependence on $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$
even when the maximum unconditional total variance (without conditioning on
$(h, s)$) approaches zero.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

Result: GeoClip在相同隐私预算下优于现有自适应裁剪方法，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GeoClip通过几何感知优化梯度处理，显著提升了DP-SGD的性能。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most
widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy
guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient
clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy
and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting
this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system
and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We
propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients
in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution.
GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released
noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence
guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal
transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the
probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and
image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing
adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.

Abstract: As the development of autonomous and connected vehicles advances, the
complexity of modern vehicles increases, with numerous Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) integrated into the system. In an in-vehicle network, these ECUs
communicate with one another using an standard protocol called Controller Area
Network (CAN). Securing communication among ECUs plays a vital role in
maintaining the safety and security of the vehicle. This paper proposes a
robust SDN-based False Data Detection and Mitigation System (FDDMS) for
in-vehicle networks. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection
attacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an
SDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an
attack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.
Then, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection
model, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an
effective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness. To
countermeasure the impacts of four adversarial attacks including Fast gradient
descent method, Basic iterative method, DeepFool, and the DeepFool variant, we
further enhance a re-training technique method with a threshold based selection
strategy. Finally, a mitigation scheme is implemented to redirect attack
traffic by dynamically updating flow rules through SDN. Our experimental
results show that the proposed FDDMS is robust against adversarial attacks and
effectively detects and mitigates false data injection attacks in real-time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机特征参数构建的Hamiltonian Graph Networks（HGN），用于快速训练图神经网络，解决了传统梯度优化算法训练速度慢的问题，并在多种物理系统中展示了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据驱动建模中物理对称性和约束的挑战，同时提升图神经网络的训练效率。

Method: 采用随机特征参数构建替代传统的梯度优化算法（如Adam、RMSProp等），训练Hamiltonian Graph Networks（HGN）。

Result: HGN训练速度提升高达600倍，且保持高精度；模型在8节点系统上训练后，可零样本泛化至4096节点系统。

Conclusion: HGN挑战了传统梯度优化算法在物理系统神经网络训练中的主导地位，展示了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints
remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical
laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex
N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However,
training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization
algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training,
especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different
optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained
up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative
optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust
performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring systems in up
to 3 dimensions with different geometries, while retaining essential physical
invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. We reveal
that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a
zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work
challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization
algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

Method: 提出SpectRe，将谱信息整合到持久同调图中，并分析其局部稳定性。

Result: SpectRe比现有描述符更强大，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SpectRe能提升图模型在相关学习任务中的能力。

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过动态模型选择和层级推理策略降低语言模型的计算成本，使其更适合资源受限的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的计算和能源消耗高，难以在资源受限的环境中部署，因此需要高效的推理策略。

Method: 论文提出了两种策略：路由（动态选择模型）和层级推理（逐步升级模型），以减少计算资源的使用。

Result: 这些策略能够显著降低计算成本，同时保持性能，适用于移动和边缘设备。

Conclusion: 未来的研究方向包括更快的响应时间、自适应模型选择和可扩展部署，以提升语言模型的效率和可访问性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

Motivation: 拓扑深度学习（TDL）在建模关系数据中的高阶交互方面表现出强大能力，但消息传递中的过压缩现象缺乏理论分析。

Method: 通过将单纯复形和胞腔复形及其消息传递方案视为关系结构，提出了一种统一的公理化框架，扩展了图论结果和算法。

Result: 理论分析和单纯复形网络的实证研究表明，该框架能够有效分析和缓解过压缩问题。

Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
higher-order interactions in relational data. However, phenomena such as
oversquashing in topological message-passing remain understudied and lack
theoretical analysis. We propose a unifying axiomatic framework that bridges
graph and topological message-passing by viewing simplicial and cellular
complexes and their message-passing schemes through the lens of relational
structures. This approach extends graph-theoretic results and algorithms to
higher-order structures, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of
oversquashing in topological message-passing networks. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical studies on simplicial networks, we demonstrate the
potential of this framework to advance TDL.

Motivation: 现有研究仅证明了$m=2$时EM算法的全局收敛性，而$m\geq3$时EM算法无法恢复真实参数。论文旨在解决这一限制，探索过参数化设置下的梯度EM算法性能。

Method: 采用过参数化模型（$n>m$），结合Hermite多项式和张量分解技术，分析梯度EM的动态和似然损失函数的几何特性。

Result: 证明了对于一般位置且充分分离的GMM，仅需$n=\Omega(m\log m)$的过参数化，随机初始化的梯度EM能以多项式速率全局收敛。

Conclusion: 这是首次针对$m>2$的GMM，为梯度EM算法提供全局收敛和恢复保证的研究，为相关领域提供了新的理论工具和分析方法。

Abstract: Learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its popular
variant gradient EM being arguably the most widely used algorithms in practice.
In the exact-parameterized setting, where both the ground truth GMM and the
learning model have the same number of components $m$, a vast line of work has
aimed to establish rigorous recovery guarantees for EM. However, global
convergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail
to recover the ground truth when $m\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we consider the $\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where
the learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth
GMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global
convergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated
GMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n
= \Omega(m\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the
ground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis
proceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian
Mixture analysis. We use Hermite polynomials to study the dynamics of gradient
EM and employ tensor decomposition to characterize the geometric landscape of
the likelihood loss. This is the first global convergence and recovery result
for EM or Gradient EM beyond the special case of $m=2$.

Motivation: 标准的共形预测校准方法生成的预测集过大，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在通过优化训练过程直接减小预测集大小。

Method: 提出了一种双层优化问题，并设计了DPSM算法，通过最小化预测集大小的度量（上层）来优化共形分数的分位数（下层）。

Result: DPSM在多个基准数据集和深度模型上表现优异，预测集大小减少了20.46%，验证了其理论优势。

Conclusion: DPSM通过直接优化预测集大小，显著提升了共形预测的实用性，并提供了更优的学习边界。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising uncertainty quantification framework
which works as a wrapper around a black-box classifier to construct prediction
sets (i.e., subset of candidate classes) with provable guarantees. However,
standard calibration methods for CP tend to produce large prediction sets which
makes them less useful in practice. This paper considers the problem of
integrating conformal principles into the training process of deep classifiers
to directly minimize the size of prediction sets. We formulate conformal
training as a bilevel optimization problem and propose the {\em Direct
Prediction Set Minimization (DPSM)} algorithm to solve it. The key insight
behind DPSM is to minimize a measure of the prediction set size (upper level)
that is conditioned on the learned quantile of conformity scores (lower level).
We analyze that DPSM has a learning bound of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ (with $n$ training
samples), while prior conformal training methods based on stochastic
approximation for the quantile has a bound of $\Omega(1/s)$ (with batch size
$s$ and typically $s \ll \sqrt{n}$). Experiments on various benchmark datasets
and deep models show that DPSM significantly outperforms the best prior
conformal training baseline with $20.46\%\downarrow$ in the prediction set size
and validates our theory.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Abstract: While popular optimization methods such as SGD, AdamW, and Lion depend on
steepest descent updates in either $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ norms, there
remains a critical gap in handling the non-Euclidean structure observed in
modern deep networks training. In this work, we address this need by
introducing a new accelerated $\ell_p$ steepest descent algorithm, called
Stacey, which uses interpolated primal-dual iterate sequences to effectively
navigate non-Euclidean smooth optimization tasks. In addition to providing
novel theoretical guarantees for the foundations of our algorithm, we
empirically compare our approach against these popular methods on tasks
including image classification and language model (LLM) pretraining,
demonstrating both faster convergence and higher final accuracy. We further
evaluate different values of $p$ across various models and datasets,
underscoring the importance and efficiency of non-Euclidean approaches over
standard Euclidean methods. Code can be found at

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究表明，单独使用强化学习（RL）提升语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力效果有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用从易到难（E2H）的任务调度策略，逐步提升模型的推理能力，并通过理论分析验证其收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，E2H Reasoner显著提升了小型语言模型（1.5B至3B）的推理能力，且比直接学习更高效。

Conclusion: E2H Reasoner是一种有效的提升语言模型推理能力的方法，尤其适用于小型模型。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Motivation: 现代Transformer中ReLU激活函数的减少导致稀疏性难以实现，现有方法常牺牲模型质量或增加复杂性。

Method: 采用统计top-k算法和参数重分配策略，实现硬件友好的稀疏控制。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，FFN神经元激活率仅8%，计算量减少2.5倍，解码速度提升1.79x（CPU）和1.40x（GPU）。

Conclusion: Spark Transformer在保持模型质量的同时，通过稀疏性显著提升了效率。

Abstract: The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where
the vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive
for each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for
enhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in
translating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved
away from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing
efforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,
increase parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,
the application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces
similar challenges.
  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that
achieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention
mechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard
training procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for
explicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical
top-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that
avoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard
top-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN
parameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for
identifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from
enforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the
Gemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on
standard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN
neurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This
sparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time
speedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.

Result: 在公开的脓毒症数据集上，SAFER在推荐指标和反事实死亡率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAFER是一种可信赖且理论扎实的高风险DTR解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are critical to precision medicine,
optimizing long-term outcomes through personalized, real-time decision-making
in evolving clinical contexts, but require careful supervision for unsafe
treatment risks. Existing efforts rely primarily on clinician-prescribed gold
standards despite the absence of a known optimal strategy, and predominantly
using structured EHR data without extracting valuable insights from clinical
notes, limiting their reliability for treatment recommendations. In this work,
we introduce SAFER, a calibrated risk-aware tabular-language recommendation
framework for DTR that integrates both structured EHR and clinical notes,
enabling them to learn from each other, and addresses inherent label
uncertainty by assuming ambiguous optimal treatment solution for deceased
patients. Moreover, SAFER employs conformal prediction to provide statistical
guarantees, ensuring safe treatment recommendations while filtering out
uncertain predictions. Experiments on two publicly available sepsis datasets
demonstrate that SAFER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple
recommendation metrics and counterfactual mortality rate, while offering robust
formal assurances. These findings underscore SAFER potential as a trustworthy
and theoretically grounded solution for high-stakes DTR applications.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，RIF比IF预测更准确，并提供了理论分析支持。

Conclusion: RIF是一种更优的数据归因工具，能有效检测IF无法识别的数据投毒攻击。

Abstract: How does the training data affect a model's behavior? This is the question we
seek to answer with data attribution. The leading practical approaches to data
attribution are based on influence functions (IF). IFs utilize a first-order
Taylor approximation to efficiently predict the effect of removing a set of
samples from the training set without retraining the model, and are used in a
wide variety of machine learning applications. However, especially in the
high-dimensional regime (# params $\geq \Omega($# samples$)$), they are often
imprecise and tend to underestimate the effect of sample removals, even for
simple models such as logistic regression. We present rescaled influence
functions (RIF), a new tool for data attribution which can be used as a drop-in
replacement for influence functions, with little computational overhead but
significant improvement in accuracy. We compare IF and RIF on a range of
real-world datasets, showing that RIFs offer significantly better predictions
in practice, and present a theoretical analysis explaining this improvement.
Finally, we present a simple class of data poisoning attacks that would fool
IF-based detections but would be detected by RIF.

Motivation: 现有线性边界传播验证器在大规模模型上表现良好但耦合性差，而SDP验证器虽能捕捉耦合性但计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出SDP-CROWN框架，通过SDP原理推导新的线性边界，显式捕捉神经元间的耦合性，同时保持可扩展性。

Result: 理论证明新边界比传统边界紧致√n倍，实践验证在大型模型上性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SDP-CROWN在保持可扩展性的同时，显著提升了验证紧致性，接近SDP方法的性能。

Abstract: Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively
to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is
crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture
inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to
only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid
verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the
scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new
linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures
$\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra
parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear
bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods
yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our
inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional
per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art
$\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance
on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters,
achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.

*Oktay Karakuş,Hasan Arkadaş*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于聚类的无监督框架，用于检测和分析足球比赛中的线突破传球（LBPs），并引入战术指标量化其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线突破传球（LBPs）是足球中的重要战术行为，能够穿透防线并进入高价值区域，但缺乏系统化的分析方法。

Method: 通过垂直空间分割建模对手队形，利用同步事件和跟踪数据检测LBPs，并引入空间构建比（SBR）和链式指标（LBPCh^1和LBPCh^2）量化其效果。

Result: 在2022年世界杯数据中验证了方法的有效性，揭示了不同球队和球员在垂直推进和结构破坏上的风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法可解释、可扩展，适用于现代比赛分析和球探工作流程。

Abstract: Line-breaking passes (LBPs) are crucial tactical actions in football,
allowing teams to penetrate defensive lines and access high-value spaces. In
this study, we present an unsupervised, clustering-based framework for
detecting and analysing LBPs using synchronised event and tracking data from
elite matches. Our approach models opponent team shape through vertical spatial
segmentation and identifies passes that disrupt defensive lines within open
play. Beyond detection, we introduce several tactical metrics, including the
space build-up ratio (SBR) and two chain-based variants, LBPCh$^1$ and
LBPCh$^2$, which quantify the effectiveness of LBPs in generating immediate or
sustained attacking threats. We evaluate these metrics across teams and players
in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, revealing stylistic differences in vertical
progression and structural disruption. The proposed methodology is explainable,
scalable, and directly applicable to modern performance analysis and scouting
workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HetCRF是一种针对异构图的双通道自监督学习框架，结合了掩码自编码器（MAE）和对比学习（CL）的优势，通过两阶段聚合策略和正样本增强策略，显著提升了节点分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合框架在同构图中表现良好，但在异构图中的语义稀疏性和梯度不平衡问题限制了性能。HetCRF旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HetCRF采用两阶段聚合策略适应嵌入语义，增强编码器输出以优化视图构建，并提出两种正样本增强策略平衡梯度贡献。

Result: 在四个真实异构图数据集上，HetCRF在节点分类任务中表现优于现有基线，尤其在特征缺失的数据集上提升显著。

Conclusion: HetCRF通过结合MAE和CL的优势，有效解决了异构图自监督学习中的挑战，验证了其高效性和优越性。

Abstract: In graph self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders (MAE) and contrastive
learning (CL) are two prominent paradigms. MAE focuses on reconstructing masked
elements, while CL maximizes similarity between augmented graph views. Recent
studies highlight their complementarity: MAE excels at local feature capture,
and CL at global information extraction. Hybrid frameworks for homogeneous
graphs have been proposed, but face challenges in designing shared encoders to
meet the semantic requirements of both tasks. In semantically sparse scenarios,
CL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive
and negative samples persists. This paper introduces HetCRF, a novel
dual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs.
HetCRF uses a two-stage aggregation strategy to adapt embedding semantics,
making it compatible with both MAE and CL. To address semantic sparsity, it
enhances encoder output for view construction instead of relying on raw
features, improving efficiency. Two positive sample augmentation strategies are
also proposed to balance gradient contributions. Node classification
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HetCRF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. On datasets with missing node
features, such as Aminer and Freebase, at a 40% label rate in node
classification, HetCRF improves the Macro-F1 score by 2.75% and 2.2%
respectively compared to the second-best baseline, validating its effectiveness
and superiority.

Motivation: 移动性数据因隐私问题导致数据孤岛，阻碍了基础模型的构建。

Method: MoveGCL采用生成式持续学习，通过冻结教师模型生成合成轨迹，结合知识蒸馏和混合专家Transformer，实现隐私保护和模型进化。

Result: 在六个真实城市数据集上，MoveGCL性能接近联合训练，显著优于联邦学习基线，同时保护隐私。

Conclusion: MoveGCL为移动性基础模型的发展提供了开放、可扩展且隐私保护的实用方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language
processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across
diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human
mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility
data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we
propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training
mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing
raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by
replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and
reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that
mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility
patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a
mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive
adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six
real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance
comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning
baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial
step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical
blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the
era of foundation models.

Conclusion: MarginSel通过增加困难示例的边界，有效改善了LLM的决策边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context

selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

Motivation: 探索蛋白质Transformer是否能捕捉蛋白质序列中的生物智能，并解决模型决策过程难以解释的问题。

Method: 1. 引入Protein-FN数据集；2. 设计SPT架构；3. 开发Sequence Score解释技术。

Result: SPT-Tiny模型在AR和Protein-FN数据集上分别达到94.3%和99.6%的准确率，且Sequence Score揭示了与生物学知识一致的序列模式。

Conclusion: SPT模型能高效预测蛋白质功能并捕捉生物智能，Sequence Score技术增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

Result: 在多个多目标问题和多任务学习任务上的实验验证了SVH-MOL的优越性能。

Conclusion: SVH-MOL是一种高效且稳定的方法，能够有效解决多目标学习中的Pareto解多样性与超体积值最大化问题。

Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining
the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of
optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of
dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current
methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while
maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards
the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps
to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse
gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for
SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing
schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate
its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and
multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过模型编辑技术增强低资源语言识别能力的方法，显著提升了跨域迁移学习和域外评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如古代手稿和非西方语言）在识别系统中代表性不足的问题，提升模型对新数据分布的泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，即使在相同训练数据下，该方法在跨字母表迁移学习和域外评估中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建能够快速适应低资源字母表的模型提供了新思路，扩展了文档识别的应用范围。

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIND的新方法，通过特征实例邻居发现解决深度神经网络在测试时分布变化下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试域分布变化时性能下降，影响应用体验。现有测试时适应方法难以应对动态多分布场景。

Method: FIND包含三个关键组件：层间特征解耦（LFD）、特征感知批量归一化（FABN）和选择性FABN（S-FABN）。LFD通过图结构捕获相似分布特征，FABN结合源统计和测试分布统计，S-FABN优化特征分区选择。

Result: 实验表明，FIND在动态场景中显著优于现有方法，准确率提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过特征解耦和动态归一化策略，有效解决了测试时分布变化问题，提升了模型鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Caterpillar GNN在合成图级任务中表现优异，同时在真实数据集上预测性能相当且显著减少了计算图的隐藏层节点数。

Conclusion: 通过牺牲部分表达能力，Caterpillar GNN实现了更强的聚合能力和高效的计算性能。

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph
learning, typically prioritizing maximal expressive power. In contrast, we
introduce an \emph{efficient aggregation} mechanism, deliberately trading off
some expressivity for stronger and more structured aggregation capabilities.
Our approach allows seamless scaling between classical message-passing and
simpler methods based on colored or plain walks. We rigorously characterize the
expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts from a
hierarchy of generalized \emph{caterpillar graphs}. Based on this foundation,
we propose the \emph{Caterpillar GNN}, whose robust graph-level aggregation
enables it to successfully tackle synthetic graph-level task specifically
designed to be challenging for classical MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that,
on real-world datasets, the Caterpillar GNN achieves comparable predictive
performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden
layers of the computational graph.

Conclusion: FuncGNN通过改进电路表示方法，显著提升了逻辑电路分析的准确性和效率。

Abstract: As integrated circuit scale grows and design complexity rises, effective
circuit representation helps support logic synthesis, formal verification, and
other automated processes in electronic design automation. And-Inverter Graphs
(AIGs), as a compact and canonical structure, are widely adopted for
representing Boolean logic in these workflows. However, the increasing
complexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural
heterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant
challenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose
FuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract
multi-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural
heterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further
introduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate
distributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,
FuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across
layers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for
comprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level
analysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance
prediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while
reducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about
32.8%.

Conclusion: 最优传输的核心优势可能源于基本接近对齐，而非其复杂的最优耦合公式，建议未来设计应重新评估复杂性。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在低维任务中具有潜力，但在高维环境中需要进一步改进适应性。

Abstract: We present an early investigation into the use of neural diffusion processes
for global optimisation, focusing on Zhang et al.'s Path Integral Sampler. One
can use the Boltzmann distribution to formulate optimization as solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge sampling problem, then apply Girsanov's theorem with a
simple (single-point) prior to frame it in stochastic control terms, and
compute the solution's integral terms via a neural approximation (a Fourier
MLP). We provide theoretical bounds for this optimiser, results on toy
optimisation tasks, and a summary of the stochastic theory motivating the
model. Ultimately, we found the optimiser to display promising per-step
performance at optimisation tasks between 2 and 1,247 dimensions, but struggle
to explore higher-dimensional spaces when faced with a 15.9k parameter model,
indicating a need for work on adaptation in such environments.

Method: 利用二阶数据流形近似和采样，提出了CEMS方法，通过高效采样和重建新数据点来增强回归任务的性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CEMS在分布内和分布外场景中均优于现有方法，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: CEMS为回归任务提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models with a large number of parameters, often referred to as
over-parameterized models, have achieved exceptional performance across various
tasks. Despite concerns about overfitting, these models frequently generalize
well to unseen data, thanks to effective regularization techniques, with data
augmentation being among the most widely used. While data augmentation has
shown great success in classification tasks using label-preserving
transformations, its application in regression problems has received less
attention. Recently, a novel \emph{manifold learning} approach for generating
synthetic data was proposed, utilizing a first-order approximation of the data
manifold. Building on this foundation, we present a theoretical framework and
practical tools for approximating and sampling general data manifolds.
Furthermore, we introduce the Curvature-Enhanced Manifold Sampling (CEMS)
method for regression tasks. CEMS leverages a second-order representation of
the data manifold to enable efficient sampling and reconstruction of new data
points. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that CEMS delivers superior performance in
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while introducing only
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

### [240] [Differentially Private Sparse Linear Regression with Heavy-tailed Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06861)
*Xizhi Tian,Meng Ding,Touming Tao,Zihang Xiang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了高维环境下具有重尾响应的差分隐私稀疏线性回归问题，提出了两种方法（DP-IHT-H和DP-IHT-L），分别在不同假设下优化了误差界限，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对规则数据分布或低维不规则数据，无法满足高维重尾数据的需求，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种方法：DP-IHT-H（基于Huber损失和私有迭代硬阈值）和DP-IHT-L（在额外假设下进一步优化误差界限）。

Result: DP-IHT-H在(ε, δ)-DP模型下实现了误差界限，DP-IHT-L进一步优化了界限并消除了对尾部参数的依赖。实验表明，这两种方法优于标准DP算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在高维重尾数据下表现优越，为差分隐私稀疏线性回归提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As a fundamental problem in machine learning and differential privacy (DP),
DP linear regression has been extensively studied. However, most existing
methods focus primarily on either regular data distributions or low-dimensional
cases with irregular data. To address these limitations, this paper provides a
comprehensive study of DP sparse linear regression with heavy-tailed responses
in high-dimensional settings. In the first part, we introduce the DP-IHT-H
method, which leverages the Huber loss and private iterative hard thresholding
to achieve an estimation error bound of \(
  \tilde{O}\biggl(
  s^{* \frac{1 }{2}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log d}{n}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  +
  s^{* \frac{1 + 2\zeta}{2 + 2\zeta}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log^2 d}{n \varepsilon}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  \biggr) \) under the $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size, $d$ is the dimensionality, $s^*$ is the sparsity of the parameter,
and $\zeta \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the tail heaviness of the data. In the
second part, we propose DP-IHT-L, which further improves the error bound under
additional assumptions on the response and achieves \(
  \tilde{O}\Bigl(\frac{(s^*)^{3/2} \log d}{n \varepsilon}\Bigr). \) Compared to
the first result, this bound is independent of the tail parameter $\zeta$.
Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that our methods outperform standard DP algorithms designed for
``regular'' data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAFE的新型剪枝方法，通过结合稀疏性和平坦性优化，显著提升了稀疏网络的泛化性能，并在噪声数据下表现出鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏化神经网络常伴随性能下降，现有方法难以恢复原始性能。受鲁棒优化研究启发，作者旨在寻找同时稀疏且平坦的子网络。

Method: 将剪枝问题建模为稀疏约束优化问题，以平坦性为目标，采用增强拉格朗日对偶方法求解，并进一步提出广义投影操作，形成SAFE及其扩展SAFE$^+$。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模任务中，SAFE能持续生成泛化性能更好的稀疏网络，且对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAFE方法在稀疏性和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于实际场景，且优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

Result: LSE估计器在方差减少和长尾条件下表现稳健，理论分析支持其收敛速度。

Conclusion: LSE估计器在理论和实践中均优于传统方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Off-policy learning and evaluation leverage logged bandit feedback datasets,
which contain context, action, propensity score, and feedback for each data
point. These scenarios face significant challenges due to high variance and
poor performance with low-quality propensity scores and heavy-tailed reward
distributions. We address these issues by introducing a novel estimator based
on the log-sum-exponential (LSE) operator, which outperforms traditional
inverse propensity score estimators. Our LSE estimator demonstrates variance
reduction and robustness under heavy-tailed conditions. For off-policy
evaluation, we derive upper bounds on the estimator's bias and variance. In the
off-policy learning scenario, we establish bounds on the regret -- the
performance gap between our LSE estimator and the optimal policy -- assuming
bounded $(1+\epsilon)$-th moment of weighted reward. Notably, we achieve a
convergence rate of $O(n^{-\epsilon/(1+ \epsilon)})$ for the regret bounds,
where $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ and $n$ is the size of logged bandit feedback
dataset. Theoretical analysis is complemented by comprehensive empirical
evaluations in both off-policy learning and evaluation scenarios, confirming
the practical advantages of our approach. The code for our estimator is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FREE的方法，通过对抗训练和GAN框架在视觉语言模型中实现早期退出策略，以提升推理速度并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽然性能优异，但模型体积大导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用对抗训练方法（FREE），在GAN框架中训练退出分类器，每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和分类器，通过输入自适应推理提升速度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将推理速度提升1.51倍以上，同时保持性能，并缓解了过度思考和中间危机现象。

Conclusion: FREE方法有效解决了VLMs的推理延迟问题，提升了模型鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对抗性训练框架AT-DPT，用于增强决策预训练变换器（DPT）对奖励中毒攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ICRL的鲁棒性，特别是针对DPT的奖励中毒攻击。

Method: 提出AT-DPT框架，同时训练攻击者和DPT模型，攻击者试图通过污染奖励最小化真实奖励，而DPT则从污染数据中推断最优动作。

Result: AT-DPT在强盗算法和MDP设置中显著优于基线方法，表现出对复杂环境的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AT-DPT能有效提升DPT对奖励中毒攻击的鲁棒性，适用于多种环境。

Abstract: We study the corruption-robustness of in-context reinforcement learning
(ICRL), focusing on the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT, Lee et al.,
2023). To address the challenge of reward poisoning attacks targeting the DPT,
we propose a novel adversarial training framework, called Adversarially Trained
Decision-Pretrained Transformer (AT-DPT). Our method simultaneously trains an
attacker to minimize the true reward of the DPT by poisoning environment
rewards, and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from the poisoned data. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against standard bandit algorithms,
including robust baselines designed to handle reward contamination. Our results
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms these baselines in
bandit settings, under a learned attacker. We additionally evaluate AT-DPT on
an adaptive attacker, and observe similar results. Furthermore, we extend our
evaluation to the MDP setting, confirming that the robustness observed in
bandit scenarios generalizes to more complex environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用潜在Kronecker结构的方法，以解决高斯过程在大数据集上的计算扩展性问题，显著减少资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程在大数据集上的计算扩展性受限，现有方法通常需要近似或不现实的假设。

Method: 通过将观测值的核矩阵表示为潜在Kronecker积的投影，结合迭代线性系统求解器和路径条件，实现精确高斯过程推断。

Result: 在多达五百万个实例的真实数据集上，该方法优于现有稀疏和变分高斯过程方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程在大规模数据集上的应用提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge
due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the
Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their
application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In
particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel
matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be
expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any
observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which
frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this
limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the
kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker
product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise
conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational
GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including
robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为图数据的不确定性估计提供了一种新思路，并展示了在分布偏移情况下的优越性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with
limited monitoring data. Fine-grained air quality monitoring information is
essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we
propose a physics-guided graph neural network architecture called GraPhy with
layers and edge features designed specifically for low-resolution monitoring
data. Experiments using data from California's socioeconomically disadvantaged
San Joaquin Valley show that GraPhy achieves the overall best performance
evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square
value (R2), improving the performance by 9%-56% compared to various baseline
models. Moreover, GraPhy consistently outperforms baselines across different

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术难以同时处理表格数据中的文本信息、可变列数和无元数据等问题，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 设计了“basis transformers”架构，考虑了表格数据的固有不变性（如层次结构和数值表示）。

Result: 在OpenML-CTR23基准测试中，中位数R²得分提高了0.338，参数数量仅为最佳基线的五分之一。

Conclusion: basis transformers在表格数据处理中表现出色，优于现有基线模型。

Abstract: Dealing with tabular data is challenging due to partial information, noise,
and heterogeneous structure. Existing techniques often struggle to
simultaneously address key aspects of tabular data such as textual information,
a variable number of columns, and unseen data without metadata besides column
names. We propose a novel architecture, \textit{basis transformers},
specifically designed to tackle these challenges while respecting inherent
invariances in tabular data, including hierarchical structure and the
representation of numeric values. We evaluate our design on a multi-task
tabular regression benchmark, achieving an improvement of 0.338 in the median
$R^2$ score and the lowest standard deviation across 34 tasks from the
OpenML-CTR23 benchmark. Furthermore, our model has five times fewer parameters
than the best-performing baseline and surpasses pretrained large language model
baselines -- even when initialized from randomized weights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对图像分类器的非对称黑盒攻击框架，通过优化搜索策略和梯度估计过程，减少高成本查询的依赖，显著降低总攻击成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设所有查询成本相同，而实际中某些查询可能触发额外审查或惩罚，导致非对称成本。针对这一场景的有效算法仍不足。

Method: 提出非对称搜索（AS）和非对称梯度估计（AGREST），平衡不同类型查询以最小化总成本，并集成到现有黑盒攻击中。

Result: 在多种成本设置下，新方法总查询成本和扰动幅度均优于现有方法，某些场景下提升达40%。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理非对称查询成本提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了攻击效率。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对神经网络训练中锐化动态的理解，强调了深度、训练数据和优化器之间的相互作用。

Abstract: When training deep neural networks with gradient descent, sharpness often
increases -- a phenomenon known as progressive sharpening -- before saturating
at the edge of stability. Although commonly observed in practice, the
underlying mechanisms behind progressive sharpening remain poorly understood.
In this work, we study this phenomenon using a minimalist model: a deep linear
network with a single neuron per layer. We show that this simple model
effectively captures the sharpness dynamics observed in recent empirical
studies, offering a simple testbed to better understand neural network
training. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how dataset properties, network
depth, stochasticity of optimizers, and step size affect the degree of
progressive sharpening in the minimalist model. We then empirically demonstrate
how these theoretical insights extend to practical scenarios. This study offers
a deeper understanding of sharpness dynamics in neural network training,
highlighting the interplay between depth, training data, and optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流近似动作值迭代RL算法在高方差随机环境中存在高估偏差，导致策略次优，且现有方法难以确保安全约束。

Method: 结合分位数回归和CVaR，设计风险正则化算法，提供理论保证。

Result: 在动态避障任务中，相比风险中性方法，算法实现了更高的目标达成率和更低碰撞率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了安全性和性能，适用于高方差环境。

Abstract: Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in
high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration
methods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go
using quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies
safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not
explicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require
complex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost
functions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based
algorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety
without complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the
contraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in
Wasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution.
Simulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our
approach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better
safety-performance trade-offs compared to risk-neutral methods.

Motivation: 解决临床预测中数据分布变化导致的模型性能下降问题，尤其是缺乏域标签和忽视医学知识的问题。

Method: 利用ICD-9-CM层次结构分组疾病，迭代修剪细粒度域，并通过Siamese推理机制分离域相关信号。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优于其他基线模型，尤其在域差异显著时。

Conclusion: UdonCare展示了医学知识在提升临床领域泛化中的潜力。

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

Motivation: 现有文献中关于1-identification问题的非渐近分析尚不明确，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了新算法Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE)，并从非渐近角度进行了理论分析。

Result: SEE算法在样本复杂度上实现了近乎最优的上界和下界匹配，差距仅为多项式对数因子。数值实验也验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: SEE算法在1-identification问题上表现优异，填补了非渐近分析的空白。

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the
1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure
exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean
reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes
such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct
with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the
asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but
they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a
new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct
theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the
literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and
lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower
bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also
indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的认证机器遗忘方法，通过噪声微调保留数据实现可证明的遗忘保证，无需对损失函数做假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 理论分析了效率与准确性的权衡，实证表明方法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 方法具有广泛适用性，实现了形式化遗忘保证且实际效果良好。

Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the
influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by
privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be
forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or
lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified
machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy
amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning
on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure
provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the
underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings.
We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and
demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning
guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing
baselines. Our code is available at

### [256] [Fully Explainable Classification Models Using Hyperblocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06986)
*Austin Snyder,Ryan Gallagher,Boris Kovalerchuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Hyperblocks的改进方法，旨在提升模型的可解释性、减少训练时间并降低复杂度，同时保持准确性。通过简化算法和引入k-NN回退机制，实现了高性能且透明的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Hyperblocks方法虽然有效，但复杂度高且不易解释。论文旨在优化这些方面，使模型更透明且易于专家理解。

Method: 提出了一套Hyperblock简化算法，包括去除冗余属性和块、创建分离单元，并引入k-NN回退机制以覆盖未被块覆盖的数据点。

Result: 在WBC（9维）和MNIST（784维）数据集上，模型在保持高准确性的同时显著降低了复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维大数据集提供了一种透明且高效的替代方案，适用于需要信任和清晰度的领域。

Abstract: Building on existing work with Hyperblocks, which classify data using minimum
and maximum bounds for each attribute, we focus on enhancing interpretability,
decreasing training time, and reducing model complexity without sacrificing
accuracy. This system allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to directly inspect
and understand the model's decision logic without requiring extensive machine
learning expertise. To reduce Hyperblock complexity while retaining
performance, we introduce a suite of algorithms for Hyperblock simplification.
These include removing redundant attributes, removing redundant blocks through
overlap analysis, and creating disjunctive units. These methods eliminate
unnecessary parameters, dramatically reducing model size without harming
classification power. We increase robustness by introducing an interpretable
fallback mechanism using k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for points not
covered by any block, ensuring complete data coverage while preserving model
transparency. Our results demonstrate that interpretable models can scale to
high-dimensional, large-volume datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy.
On benchmark datasets such as WBC (9-D), we achieve strong predictive
performance with significantly reduced complexity. On MNIST (784-D), our method
continues to improve through tuning and simplification, showing promise as a
transparent alternative to black-box models in domains where trust, clarity,
and control are crucial.

TL;DR: 本文分析了K-means算法的局部最优性保证，提出了改进方法以确保局部最优性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管K-means算法在机器学习中广泛应用，但其局部最优性缺乏严格分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了基于Bregman散度的改进K-means算法，确保连续和离散意义上的局部最优性，同时保持与原算法相同的计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，原K-means算法在实践中并不总能找到局部最优解，而改进方法显著降低了聚类损失。

Conclusion: 改进后的K-means算法在局部最优性方面表现更优，且计算效率与原算法相当。

Abstract: The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely studied clustering algorithms
in machine learning. While extensive research has focused on its ability to
achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of
its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions
under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution.
Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which
ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the
same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the
dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an
extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means
algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not
always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods
provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理约束的扩散模型，用于检测异常轨迹，以应对GPS欺骗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决国际水域非法活动（如非法捕鱼和石油走私）中的GPS欺骗问题，同时应对AI生成假轨迹的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种物理信息扩散模型，结合运动学约束来识别不符合物理规律的轨迹。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，该方法在异常检测和轨迹生成方面具有更高的准确性和更低的误差率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法在细粒度时空依赖性和物理知识方面的不足，提升了异常轨迹检测的性能。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

TL;DR: ProbHardE2E是一个通用的概率预测框架，通过新颖的可微分概率投影层（DPPL）实现硬约束和不确定性量化，适用于多种神经网络架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过后处理或在推理时满足约束，且依赖于分布假设，限制了模型的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用DPPL层，以端到端方式学习系统，支持非线性约束和严格评分规则优化。

Result: 在偏微分方程学习和时间序列预测中展示了广泛适用性。

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E是一个通用且灵活的框架，能够连接不同领域并提升预测性能。

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种透明公平的框架，用于比较基于车辆动力学的驾驶员疲劳检测（DDD）方法，并验证其可重复性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DDD方法存在性能指标不可靠和可重复性差的问题，部分研究存在数据泄露或未公开数据集。本文旨在通过公开数据集和标准化框架解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了一个框架，从公开数据集中提取特征，并使用轻量级ML模型进行DDD；实现了三种现有方法和一种基于随机森林（RF）的新方法。

Result: 在评估的方法中，基于RF的方法达到了88%的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非标准化开发的DDD方法的固有问题，并展示了一种高性能且实现得当的方法。

Abstract: Driver drowsiness detection (DDD) prevents road accidents caused by driver
fatigue. Vehicle dynamics-based DDD has been proposed as a method that is both
economical and high performance. However, there are concerns about the
reliability of performance metrics and the reproducibility of many of the
existing methods. For instance, some previous studies seem to have a data
leakage issue among training and test datasets, and many do not openly provide
the datasets they used. To this end, this paper aims to compare the performance
of representative vehicle dynamics-based DDD methods under a transparent and
fair framework that uses a public dataset. We first develop a framework for
extracting features from an open dataset by Aygun et al. and performing DDD
with lightweight ML models; the framework is carefully designed to support a
variety of onfigurations. Second, we implement three existing representative
methods and a concise random forest (RF)-based method in the framework.
Finally, we report the results of experiments to verify the reproducibility and
clarify the performance of DDD based on common metrics. Among the evaluated
methods, the RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88 %. Our
findings imply the issues inherent in DDD methods developed in a non-standard
manner, and demonstrate a high performance method implemented appropriately.

TL;DR: AlphaSteer是一种基于理论的方法，通过优化激活引导向量，在提升LLM安全性的同时保持其通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实应用中的部署增加，确保其能够拒绝恶意提示（如越狱攻击）至关重要，但现有方法在安全性和实用性之间存在权衡。

Method: AlphaSteer将激活引导视为可学习过程，通过两个目标优化：实用性保持（构造接近零的引导向量）和安全性增强（构造拒绝方向向量）。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaSteer在多种越狱攻击和实用性基准测试中显著提升LLM安全性，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: AlphaSteer是一种高效且理论支持的方法，解决了LLM安全性与实用性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出MATI方法，解决表格数据回归任务中的不平衡问题，通过区域感知混合专家和测试时自监督专家聚合，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在现实应用中广泛存在，但回归任务中的数据不平衡问题研究不足，导致模型泛化能力受限。

Method: MATI采用高斯混合模型捕捉相关区域，训练区域特定专家，并通过测试时自监督动态调整专家权重。

Result: 在四种真实数据集上，MATI平均MAE提升7.1%。

Conclusion: MATI有效解决了表格回归任务中的不平衡问题，适应不同测试分布。

Abstract: Tabular data serve as a fundamental and ubiquitous representation of
structured information in numerous real-world applications, e.g., finance and
urban planning. In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance
has been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in
certain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability. However, the
imbalance issue of tabular regression tasks is underexplored, and yet is
critical due to unclear boundaries for continuous labels and simplifying
assumptions in existing imbalance regression work, which often rely on known
and balanced test distributions. Such assumptions may not hold in practice and
can lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:
Mixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular
Imbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware
Mixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying
related regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then
used to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique
characteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised
Expert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on
test data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test
distributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance
regression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.
To reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test
distributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a
normal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution
that emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test
distributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing
methods.

Motivation: 解决分布鲁棒强化学习在平均奖励设定中的理论问题，特别是在不确定性下的收敛性。

Result: 算法在样本复杂度为O(ε^-2)和O(ε^-3)时分别学习到鲁棒Q函数和ε最优策略。

Conclusion: 这些结果推动了平均奖励设定下分布鲁棒强化学习的理论发展。

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统在关键领域中使用时，可能因历史数据中的偏见而加剧社会不平等。现有因果公平框架假设已知正确的因果模型，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出FairPFN，通过预训练合成因果公平数据的表格基础模型，无需因果模型知识即可识别和消除受保护属性的因果效应。

Result: FairPFN在多样化的手工和真实场景中表现优于基线方法，有效识别和移除受保护属性的因果效应。

Conclusion: FairPFN为复杂公平问题提供了更易用的因果公平解决方案，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as
healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often
trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML
decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal
fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate
algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and
indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key
limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model,
restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal
models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose
FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness
data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its
predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the
causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and
removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and
real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way
for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a
wider variety of complex fairness problems.

Result: 理论分析表明增加搜索深度可减少不良驻点；实验验证PGTS在多种环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: PGTS通过前瞻机制显著提升策略优化的全局性能，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

Conclusion: E-BATS为实际语音处理系统在声学变化下的高效适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when
deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as
background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently
emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time
without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA
approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are
memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and
resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer
improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they
are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from
speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing
unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the
first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for
speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation
effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i)
lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii)
a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local
distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving
average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments
conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions
demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over
backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to
backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under
acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient
adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world
environments.

Motivation: 状态熵正则化在实践中表现出更好的探索性和样本效率，但其理论保证尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，并分析其在转移学习中常见但常被忽视的结构化扰动下的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究了状态熵正则化在奖励和转移不确定性下的表现，并与策略熵正则化进行了对比。

Result: 状态熵正则化在结构化扰动下表现出更强的鲁棒性，但其优势对用于策略评估的rollout数量更为敏感。

Conclusion: 状态熵正则化在特定场景下具有显著的鲁棒性优势，但其实际效果依赖于策略评估的细节。

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and
sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical
guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy
regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated
perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but
often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small,
uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these
robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition
uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our
analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy
regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a
practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the
robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of
rollouts used for policy evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation in the
$\ell^2$-regularized non-linear least-squares setting with fixed design. In
particular, we study confidence estimation for local minimizers of the
regularized training loss. We show a pointwise confidence bound, meaning that
it holds for the prediction on any given fixed test input $x$. Importantly, the
proposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the
training data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance,
becoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data).
This desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the
inverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized
version of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\top} \text{Cov}^{-1} x$.
Our generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the
classical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE
estimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm,
which only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss
function. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing
that the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off
compared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard
method in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural
networks.

Conclusion: 提出的DPSC技术通过数据转换和分布式计算，显著提升了患者相似性计算的性能和效率。

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效建模时空维度间的复杂依赖关系，且在填补过程中容易产生累积误差。

Result: 实验表明，CoFILL在填补精度上优于现有方法，并能生成符合真实数据分布的填补值。

Conclusion: CoFILL为解决时空数据填补问题提供了一种高效且鲁棒的新方法。

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线BBO方法局限于单任务和固定维度，缺乏统一的数值空间表示，阻碍了跨领域通用优化的实现。

Result: 实验证明所提方法具有通用性和有效性，能够克服传统BBO的局限性。

Conclusion: 结合语言模型先验和学习字符串嵌入空间，为通用BBO算法的发展提供了新路径。

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为QDRT的新框架，通过行为条件训练和开放式的行为重放缓冲，解决了现有红队测试方法在多样性和攻击策略覆盖上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性至关重要，但现有红队测试方法在多样性和攻击策略覆盖上存在局限性。

Method: QDRT框架通过行为条件训练实现目标驱动的多样性，并训练多个专门化的攻击模型以覆盖不同攻击风格和风险类别。

Result: 实验表明，QDRT生成的攻击在多样性和有效性上均优于现有方法，适用于多种目标LLM。

Conclusion: QDRT为LLM安全性提供了一种系统且有效的自动化红队测试方法，支持LLM的负责任部署。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为可靠策略迭代（RPI）的新算法，解决了在函数逼近下策略迭代的单调性保证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）研究多年，但在函数逼近下正确使用RL算法仍具挑战性，例如策略迭代的单调性保证会失效。

Method: RPI通过将策略评估中的投影或Bellman误差最小化替换为基于Bellman的约束优化，确保单调性和收敛性。

Result: RPI不仅保证了值估计的单调性，还提供了真实回报的下界，并在经典控制任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RPI是首个在函数逼近下具有单调性和收敛性保证的算法，且其模型无关变体易于集成到主流RL实现中。

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

Result: AMoPO在7B、14B和32B模型上表现出色，性能提升28.5%，验证了其适应性和扩展性。

Conclusion: AMoPO能实现维度感知偏好对齐，具有显著优势，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

Result: 实验表明，GAGA仅需1%标注数据即可达到或超越现有方法的分类准确率。

Conclusion: GAGA高效且成本低，适用于TAG表示学习。

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Method: 结合随机共享嵌入和自适应图卷积的正则化框架，以及基于余弦相似性的高效余弦算子。

Result: 在四个大规模真实交通数据集上，RAGL在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGL通过正则化和高效计算，显著提升了交通预测的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Motivation: 传统神经网络依赖反向传播调整权重，而Neurovectors通过向量关系和信息结构化，提供更灵活和可解释的学习过程。

Method: 利用Neurovectors在向量空间中结构化数据，通过能量传播而非权重更新驱动学习，生成动态知识表示。

Result: 在UCI和Kaggle数据集上的实验表明，Neurovectors在分类和回归任务中达到了与传统机器学习和深度学习模型相当的准确率。

Conclusion: Neurovectors提供了一种高效且可解释的替代方案，适用于表格数据处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel learning approach based on Neurovectors, an
innovative paradigm that structures information through interconnected nodes
and vector relationships for tabular data processing. Unlike traditional
artificial neural networks that rely on weight adjustment through
backpropagation, Neurovectors encode information by structuring data in vector
spaces where energy propagation, rather than traditional weight updates, drives
the learning process, enabling a more adaptable and explainable learning
process. Our method generates dynamic representations of knowledge through
neurovectors, thereby improving both the interpretability and efficiency of the
predictive model. Experimental results using datasets from well-established
repositories such as the UCI machine learning repository and Kaggle are
reported both for classification and regression. To evaluate its performance,
we compare our approach with standard machine learning and deep learning
models, showing that Neurovectors achieve competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: 双曲几何为复杂、结构化和层次化数据域的生成建模提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Generating graphs with hierarchical structures remains a fundamental
challenge due to the limitations of Euclidean geometry in capturing exponential
complexity. Here we introduce \textbf{GGBall}, a novel hyperbolic framework for
graph generation that integrates geometric inductive biases with modern
generative paradigms. GGBall combines a Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder
(HVQVAE) with a Riemannian flow matching prior defined via closed-form
geodesics. This design enables flow-based priors to model complex latent
distributions, while vector quantization helps preserve the curvature-aware
structure of the hyperbolic space. We further develop a suite of hyperbolic GNN
and Transformer layers that operate entirely within the manifold, ensuring
stability and scalability. Empirically, our model reduces degree MMD by over
75\% on Community-Small and over 40\% on Ego-Small compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating an improved ability to preserve topological
hierarchies. These results highlight the potential of hyperbolic geometry as a
powerful foundation for the generative modeling of complex, structured, and
hierarchical data domains. Our code is available at

Result: 实验证明Perception-R1在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，仅需少量训练数据。

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效提升了MLLMs的多模态感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Result: 实验表明，“超频”方法能减少过度思考，提高答案准确性，并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 通过调节推理长度和优化内部进度编码，可以有效提升LLMs在显式推理中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce Interactive Bayesian Distributional Robustness (IBDR), a novel

connects the distributional population loss with the approximate posterior,
motivating a practical dual optimization procedure that enforces distributional

Conclusion: SPlus通过解决Shampoo的缺陷，显著提升了优化效率和稳定性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network
optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and
alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we
find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached
for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a
historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in
across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.
Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across
network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large
parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks
faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed
Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language
modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different
stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation
performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock
time.

Abstract: Modern data marketplaces and data sharing consortia increasingly rely on
incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute data. However, schemes
that reward agents based on the quantity of submitted data are vulnerable to
manipulation, as agents may submit fabricated or low-quality data to inflate
their rewards. Prior work has proposed comparing each agent's data against
others' to promote honesty: when others contribute genuine data, the best way
to minimize discrepancy is to do the same. Yet prior implementations of this
idea rely on very strong assumptions about the data distribution (e.g.
Gaussian), limiting their applicability. In this work, we develop reward
mechanisms based on a novel, two-sample test inspired by the Cram\'er-von Mises
statistic. Our methods strictly incentivize agents to submit more genuine data,
while disincentivizing data fabrication and other types of untruthful
reporting. We establish that truthful reporting constitutes a (possibly
approximate) Nash equilibrium in both Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings. We
theoretically instantiate our method in three canonical data sharing problems
and show that it relaxes key assumptions made by prior work. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our mechanism incentivizes truthful data sharing via
simulations and on real-world language and image data.

TL;DR: 结合cMAB和LLM的混合方法用于个性化干预，以增加步数和接受度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统cMAB算法需要大样本且忽视心理因素，需改进。

Method: 结合cMAB选择干预类型和LLM个性化内容，评估四种干预模型。

Result: 通过因果推断框架评估，发现LLM和cMAB互补。

Conclusion: 混合方法为个性化行为干预提供新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB)
algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by
delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However,
cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn
effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly
encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines
cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to
personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral
self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each
delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical
activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using
dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,
social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants
receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,
combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization
(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework
to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the
complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in
promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: EVINET证明了不确定性估计和逻辑推理的重要性，为开放世界图学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often
studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known
a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment,
it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong
prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification
detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes,
i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning
Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by
integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes
two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and
Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple
metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification
detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity
of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection
and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph
learning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/SSSKJ/EviNET.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential

scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world
animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models
designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an

Result: 在多种数据集（如面部图像、人体活动信号、语音记录）上验证了PASS的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: PASS能够有效保护隐私属性，同时保持数据的实用性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing Machine Learning (ML) services require extensive collections of
user data, which may inadvertently include people's private information
irrelevant to the services. Various studies have been proposed to protect
private attributes by removing them from the data while maintaining the
utilities of the data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, as we theoretically
and empirically show in the paper, these methods reveal severe vulnerability
because of a common weakness rooted in their adversarial training based
strategies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach, PASS,
designed to stochastically substitute the original sample with another one
according to certain probabilities, which is trained with a novel loss function
soundly derived from information-theoretic objective defined for
utility-preserving private attributes protection. The comprehensive evaluation
of PASS on various datasets of different modalities, including facial images,
human activity sensory signals, and voice recording datasets, substantiates
PASS's effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来长上下文模型部署提供了高效解决方案，并开源了实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

Abstract: Many security and network applications require having large datasets to train
the machine learning models. Limited data access is a well-known problem in the
security domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer models
to enlarge the size of data by synthesizing new samples, but the synthesized
samples don't improve the models over the real data. To address this issue, we
design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to
generate time-series data, that can be used to boost the performance of
existing and new ML workflows. Our new transformer model achieves the SOTA
results. We style our model to be generalizable and work across different
datasets, and produce high-quality samples.

Abstract: We present DEF (\textbf{\ul{D}}iffusion-augmented \textbf{\ul{E}}nsemble
\textbf{\ul{F}}orecasting), a novel approach for generating initial condition
perturbations. Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are
primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting
their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for
weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often
developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional
diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be
applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the
level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any
deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our
stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over
long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We
validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which
comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid,
spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method
demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备移动性导致间歇性连接，影响AFL的收敛性，需要研究梯度稀疏化与模型陈旧性的交互作用。

Method: 开发理论模型分析稀疏化、模型陈旧性和移动性接触模式的交互作用，并提出MADS算法动态调整稀疏化程度。

Result: MADS算法在低速时增加稀疏化程度以提升收敛性，高速时减少稀疏化以确保上传可靠性。实验显示在CIFAR-10数据集上分类准确率提升8.76%，Argoverse轨迹预测误差降低9.46%。

Conclusion: MADS算法有效优化了AFL的收敛性，适用于不同移动速度场景。

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) enables distributed model training
across multiple mobile devices, allowing each device to independently update
its local model without waiting for others. However, device mobility introduces
intermittent connectivity, which necessitates gradient sparsification and leads
to model staleness, jointly affecting AFL convergence. This paper develops a
theoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model
staleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL
convergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic
sparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based
on contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing
that under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to
enhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the
sparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact
time. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings. Compared with the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, the MADS algorithm increases the image
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 8.76% and reduces the
average displacement error in the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by
9.46%.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，恶意意图检测需求增加，需要高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 探索了五种逐步复杂的基于Transformer的架构，包括Sharanga、Mahendra、Vaishnava、Ashwina和Raudra，并在九个对抗性数据集上进行了基准测试。

Result: Raudra的多任务设计表现最稳健，但每种架构在速度、可解释性和资源需求上有独特权衡。

Conclusion: JavelinGuard为实际LLM安全应用提供了复杂性与效率的最佳平衡选择。

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each
architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and
resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance
of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型（LLM）在处理结构化数据时，由于输入被序列化为扁平序列，无法充分利用结构依赖关系，影响了任务性能。

Method: Graph-KV利用KV缓存作为压缩表示，并通过结构归纳偏置控制片段间的交互，引入图结构块掩码和消息传递机制，同时优化位置编码以减少偏差。

Result: Graph-KV在多个任务（如RAG、学术论文QA和主题分类）中表现优于基线方法，显著减少了位置偏差并提升了性能。

Conclusion: Graph-KV通过结合结构归纳偏置和优化位置编码，为LLM处理结构化数据提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring
input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural
dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage
structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where
inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the
potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text
segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through
structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively
attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than
all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a
graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a
message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated
positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and
context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)
seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and
long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with
full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper
topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing
positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV
substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential
encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly
available.

Motivation: 在封闭环境中，传统适应方法不可行，因为需要访问模型参数或架构。SALT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在客户端引入紧凑可训练的适配器，优化头部网络的潜在特征，实现用户特定适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证，SALT提高了准确性且训练延迟更低。

Conclusion: SALT为边缘AI系统在严格约束下提供了一种实用的个性化推理解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

Motivation: 多GPU MoE网络中专家负载不均衡，现有动态复制方法需预判token分布，但预测策略存在性能与开销的权衡。

Method: 提出MoE-GPS框架，量化预测策略对系统运行时间的影响，推荐仅预测整体token分布的策略（Distribution-Only Prediction）。

Result: 在Mixtral 8x7B MMLU数据集上，Distribution-Only Prediction比传统方法提升23%的推理性能。

Conclusion: MoE-GPS为多GPU MoE网络提供了高效的预测策略选择框架，显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: In multi-GPU Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, experts are distributed across
different GPUs, which creates load imbalance as each expert processes different
number of tokens. Recent works improve MoE inference load balance by
dynamically duplicating popular experts to more GPUs to process excessive
tokens, which requires predicting the distribution before routing. In this
paper, we discuss the tradeoff of prediction strategies, accuracies, overhead,
and end-to-end system performance. We propose MoE-GPS, a framework that guides
the selection of the optimal predictor design under various system
configurations, by quantifying the performance impact to system-level model
runtime. Specifically, we advocate for Distribution-Only Prediction, a
prediction strategy that only predicts overall token distribution which
significantly reduces overhead compared to the traditional Token-to-Expert
Prediction. On Mixtral 8x7B MMLU dataset, MoE-GPS suggests Distribution-Only
Prediction which improves end-to-end inference performance by more than 23%
compared with Token-to-Expert Prediction.

Conclusion: 矩对齐理论为域泛化提供了统一框架，CMA算法高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to develop models that generalize well to
unseen target domains, addressing the prevalent issue of distribution shifts in
real-world applications. One line of research in DG focuses on aligning
domain-level gradients and Hessians to enhance generalization. However,
existing methods are computationally inefficient and the underlying principles
of these approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we develop the
theory of moment alignment for DG. Grounded in \textit{transfer measure}, a
principled framework for quantifying generalizability between two domains, we
first extend the definition of transfer measure to domain generalization that
includes multiple source domains and establish a target error bound. Then, we
prove that aligning derivatives across domains improves transfer measure both
when the feature extractor induces an invariant optimal predictor across
domains and when it does not. Notably, moment alignment provides a unifying
understanding of Invariant Risk Minimization, gradient matching, and Hessian
matching, three previously disconnected approaches to DG. We further connect
feature moments and derivatives of the classifier head, and establish the
duality between feature learning and classifier fitting. Building upon our
theory, we introduce \textbf{C}losed-Form \textbf{M}oment \textbf{A}lignment
(CMA), a novel DG algorithm that aligns domain-level gradients and Hessians in
closed-form. Our method overcomes the computational inefficiencies of existing
gradient and Hessian-based techniques by eliminating the need for repeated
backpropagation or sampling-based Hessian estimation. We validate the efficacy
of our approach through two sets of experiments: linear probing and full
fine-tuning. CMA demonstrates superior performance in both settings compared to
Empirical Risk Minimization and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: This research endeavors to offer insights into unlocking the further
potential of transformer-based architectures. One of the primary motivations is
to offer a geometric interpretation for the attention mechanism in
transformers. In our framework, the attention mainly involves metric tensors,
tangent spaces, inner product, and how they relate to each other. These
quantities and structures at discrete positions are intricately interconnected
via the parallel transport of tangent vectors. To make the learning process
more efficient, we reduce the number of parameters through ingenious predefined
configurations. Moreover, we introduce an explicit mechanism to highlight a
neighborhood by attenuating the remote values, given that transformers
inherently neglect local inductive bias. Experimental results demonstrate that
our modules deliver significant performance improvements relative to the
baseline. More evaluation experiments on visual and large language models will
be launched successively.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多云环境的快速发展，确保智能监控系统的安全性和可靠性变得日益重要。

Method: 在现有监控框架基础上，创新引入多级特征提取方法，结合LLM的自然语言处理能力和传统机器学习方法，动态适应不同云服务提供商和环境。

Conclusion: 该研究为多云环境下的智能监控系统提供了一种高效、可靠的异常检测与预警解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly
important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring
systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning
mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on
Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring
framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature
extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of
LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management
ability of cloud infrastructure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数阶雅可比矩阵（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$）的分数阶矩阵微分方法，并将其应用于深度学习中的自动微分技术，验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数阶微分具有独特特性，可优化神经网络算法，但缺乏与自动微分技术兼容的理论方法。

Method: 通过整数阶雅可比矩阵定义引入分数阶雅可比矩阵微分（${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$），并设计分数阶Autograd技术，支持隐藏层中的分数阶微分。

Result: 实验表明，${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$在训练集、验证集和测试集上表现优越，是一种优秀的分数阶梯度下降方法。

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$为深度学习中的分数阶微分提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

TL;DR: VarCon提出了一种变分监督对比学习方法，通过变分推断优化类别感知匹配，显著提升了对比学习的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对比学习中嵌入分布缺乏显式调控和过度依赖大批量负样本的问题。

Method: 将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类别变量的变分推断，最大化后验加权的证据下界（ELBO）。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，如ImageNet-1K上79.36%的Top-1准确率，并展示了更清晰的决策边界和语义组织。

Conclusion: VarCon在性能、泛化能力和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，为对比学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Result: 在NVIDIA DRIVE Thor平台上测试，流水线实现2.5倍延迟降低，FP8量化后提升至3.2倍，且不影响任务准确性。

Conclusion: 该流水线是资源受限环境中实时部署VLM的可行解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used
in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the
computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EviSEC的动态图OOD检测方法，通过证据深度学习和频谱感知对比学习解决现有方法的偏差和分数同质化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的OOD检测在安全敏感领域备受关注，但现有方法主要针对静态图，存在单点估计导致的高偏差和分数同质化问题。

Method: 提出EviSEC方法，结合证据神经网络和频谱感知增强模块，通过后验Dirichlet分布解释输入随机性，并生成OOD近似样本以扩大ID与OOD分数差距。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EviSEC能有效检测动态图中的OOD样本。

Conclusion: EviSEC通过改进不确定性建模和分数差距优化，显著提升了动态图OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联邦上下文学习（Fed-ICL）框架，通过客户端与服务器的多轮交互提升问答任务的性能，避免传输模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习方法依赖高质量示例，但这些示例常因隐私、标注成本和分布差异而稀缺。直接利用客户端数据又面临通信开销或利用率不足的问题。

Method: 提出Fed-ICL框架，通过客户端与服务器的迭代协作优化答案，无需传输模型参数。

Result: 理论证明了Fed-ICL的收敛性，实验显示其在标准问答基准上表现优异且通信成本低。

Conclusion: Fed-ICL是一种高效且低通信成本的解决方案，适用于隐私敏感和资源受限的场景。

Abstract: For question-answering (QA) tasks, in-context learning (ICL) enables language
models to generate responses without modifying their parameters by leveraging
examples provided in the input. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily
depends on the availability of high-quality examples, which are often scarce
due to data privacy constraints, annotation costs, and distribution
disparities. A natural solution is to utilize examples stored on client
devices, but existing approaches either require transmitting model parameters -
incurring significant communication overhead - or fail to fully exploit local
datasets, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose
Federated In-Context Learning (Fed-ICL), a general framework that enhances ICL
through an iterative, collaborative process. Fed-ICL progressively refines
responses by leveraging multi-round interactions between clients and a central
server, improving answer quality without the need to transmit model parameters.
We establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Fed-ICL and conduct
extensive experiments on standard QA benchmarks, demonstrating that our
proposed approach achieves strong performance while maintaining low
communication costs.

TL;DR: 论文提出采用贝叶斯实验建模框架来主动管理LLM中的不确定性，而非仅保守拒绝高不确定性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM部署中缺乏系统区分和应对不确定性来源的工具，导致保守策略限制了可靠性。

Method: 采用贝叶斯实验建模框架，为不确定性提供一致推理基础，并支持主动解决措施（如请求澄清或检索外部信息）。

Result: 该框架使LLM及其用户能根据情境采取适当步骤，提升系统可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架为LLM在高风险实际场景中的应用提供了更可靠、透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现，特定风格提示（如列表格式）会提高LLM对越狱攻击的易感性，且风格长度和注意力相关。提出SafeStyle防御策略，有效提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究风格提示对LLM安全性的影响，以及如何通过防御策略降低风险。

Method: 评估32个LLM在7个越狱基准上的表现，分析风格模式与攻击成功率的关系，并提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格提示显著提高攻击成功率，且与风格长度和模型注意力相关；SafeStyle在多种设置下优于基线。

Conclusion: 风格提示增加LLM安全风险，SafeStyle是一种有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质生成模型因高质量数据集稀缺而成功率受限，需一种可扩展的自动化改进方法。

Method: 引入基于ESM-fold和快速ddG预测的高效代理奖励模型，结合多奖励最大化、KL散度和序列多样性正则化。

Result: ProteinZero在结构准确性、可设计性、热力学稳定性和序列多样性上显著优于现有方法，失败率降低36%-48%，成功率超90%。

Conclusion: ProteinZero为蛋白质设计提供了持续自我改进的新范式，拓展了蛋白质设计空间的探索可能性。

Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but
still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality
protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel
framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of
the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve
computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward
models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly
accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework
balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and
a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode
collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing
methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant
improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,
and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure
rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like
ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates
exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL
run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,
including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein
design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,
opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受后门攻击，现有防御方法通常需要标记数据或特定训练流程，限制了其应用范围。

Method: TSC利用神经网络的排列不变性和二次模式连接性，通过两阶段对称连接性放大中毒样本的损失，同时保持干净样本的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，TSC在监督学习场景中表现优异，并能推广至自监督学习框架（如SimCLR和CLIP）。

Conclusion: TSC是一种通用且高效的后门防御方法，适用于多种学习范式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious
behaviors are implanted during training. While existing defenses can
effectively purify compromised models, they typically require labeled data or
specific training procedures, making them difficult to apply beyond supervised
learning settings. Notably, recent studies have shown successful backdoor
attacks across various learning paradigms, highlighting a critical security
concern. To address this gap, we propose Two-stage Symmetry Connectivity (TSC),
a novel backdoor purification defense that operates independently of data
format and requires only a small fraction of clean samples. Through theoretical
analysis, we prove that by leveraging permutation invariance in neural networks
and quadratic mode connectivity, TSC amplifies the loss on poisoned samples
while maintaining bounded clean accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that TSC
achieves robust performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in
supervised learning scenarios. Furthermore, TSC generalizes to self-supervised
learning frameworks, such as SimCLR and CLIP, maintaining its strong defense
capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePeng104/TSC.

Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐方法存在滞后性，攻击者可以针对静态防御模型进行过拟合，而防御者则无法及时应对新威胁。

Method: 采用两玩家零和博弈框架，模型在攻击者和防御者角色间切换，通过奖励模型裁决结果，实现动态协同适应。

Result: 实验表明，Self-RedTeam能发现更多样化的攻击（SBERT+21.8%），并在安全基准测试中表现更优（WildJailBreak+65.5%）。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了从被动修补到主动协同进化的转变，为语言模型安全训练提供了可扩展、自主且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Motivation: 尽管神经方法在自动推理中取得进展，但将其整合到实际验证工作流仍具挑战性。Lean缺乏类似工具，阻碍了其广泛应用。

Conclusion: LeanHammer填补了神经检索与符号推理间的鸿沟，使形式验证更易为研究者和实践者所用。

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

Motivation: RLHF依赖复杂的训练序列，而DPO及其衍生方法虽简化了流程，但仍存在正则化和插值行为的缺陷。

Method: 通过引入显式偏好优化框架EXPO，避免DPO的隐式奖励重参数化问题，并提出直观的正则化因子。

Result: EXPO在理论和实验上均优于DPO，满足正则化需求。

Conclusion: EXPO提供了一种更透明且有效的偏好优化方法，避免了DPO的潜在缺陷。

Abstract: The generated responses of large language models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned
to human preferences through a process called reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). As RLHF relies on a challenging training sequence, whereby a
separate reward model is independently learned and then later applied to LLM
policy updates, ongoing research effort has targeted more straightforward
alternatives. In this regard, direct preference optimization (DPO) and its many
offshoots circumvent the need for a separate reward training step. Instead,
through the judicious use of a reparameterization trick that induces an
\textit{implicit} reward, DPO and related methods consolidate learning to the
minimization of a single loss function. And yet despite demonstrable success in
some real-world settings, we prove that DPO-based objectives are nonetheless
subject to sub-optimal regularization and counter-intuitive interpolation
behaviors, underappreciated artifacts of the reparameterizations upon which
they are based. To this end, we introduce an \textit{explicit} preference
optimization framework termed EXPO that requires no analogous
reparameterization to achieve an implicit reward. Quite differently, we merely
posit intuitively-appealing regularization factors from scratch that
transparently avoid the potential pitfalls of key DPO variants, provably
satisfying regularization desiderata that prior methods do not. Empirical
results serve to corroborate our analyses and showcase the efficacy of EXPO.

Motivation: 现代神经网络在性能上表现出色，但计算和能耗高，逻辑门网络（LGNs）虽高效但训练时间长且存在离散化差距，影响实际部署。

Method: 在训练中注入Gumbel噪声并使用直通估计器，理论分析表明这隐含了Hessian正则化，改善了收敛性。

Result: 训练速度提升4.5倍，离散化差距减少98%，未使用门数量减少100%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LGNs的训练效率和实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous
existing benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy
consumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world
deployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates
for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve
a simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then,
almost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This
discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance
drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject
Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly
speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization
gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian
regularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train
networks $4.5 \times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap
by $98\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\%$.

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

*Perry Dong,Alec M. Lessing,Annie S. Chen,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DGN的方法，利用先验数据引导探索而非直接模仿，显著提升了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先验数据（如演示）通常用于初始化，但模仿学习目标可能损害长期性能，因为它与奖励最大化不一致。

Method: 提出DGN框架，通过向策略添加噪声来利用先验数据引导探索，避免显式行为克隆约束。

Result: 在七个模拟连续控制任务中，DGN比现有离线数据强化学习方法提升了2-3倍性能。

Conclusion: DGN通过引导探索而非模仿，有效提升了样本效率和长期性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach
achieves up to 2-3x improvement over prior reinforcement learning from offline
data methods across seven simulated continuous control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在概率分布空间上设计梯度流的新方法，通过引入Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW)距离，解决了机器学习中涉及概率分布数据的核心任务，如领域适应和数据集蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习应用涉及以概率分布表示的数据，需要新的技术来处理这种无限维对象上的梯度流。

Method: 将每个类别表示为特征的条件分布，并将数据集建模为这些类别上的混合分布，引入WoW距离并定义梯度流。

Result: 提出的框架成功应用于迁移学习和数据集蒸馏任务，利用梯度流和新型可处理函数。

Conclusion: WoW梯度流为概率分布空间上的动态设计提供了有效工具，适用于多种机器学习任务。

Abstract: Many applications in machine learning involve data represented as probability
distributions. The emergence of such data requires radically novel techniques
to design tractable gradient flows on probability distributions over this type
of (infinite-dimensional) objects. For instance, being able to flow labeled
datasets is a core task for applications ranging from domain adaptation to
transfer learning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we propose to
represent each class by the associated conditional distribution of features,
and to model the dataset as a mixture distribution supported on these classes
(which are themselves probability distributions), meaning that labeled datasets
can be seen as probability distributions over probability distributions. We
endow this space with a metric structure from optimal transport, namely the
Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance, derive a differential structure on
this space, and define WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to design
dynamics over this space that decrease a given objective functional. We apply
our framework to transfer learning and dataset distillation tasks, leveraging
our gradient flow construction as well as novel tractable functionals that take
the form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Sliced-Wasserstein based kernels
between probability distributions.

TL;DR: MetaKANs通过小型元学习器生成KANs的权重，显著减少可训练参数，提升内存效率，同时保持性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs虽然高效且可解释，但参数过多导致内存和训练成本高，需改进。

Method: 提出MetaKANs，通过端到端可微分方式训练KANs和MetaKANs，减少参数。

Result: 在符号回归、偏微分方程求解和图像分类等任务中表现优异，参数效率提升。

Conclusion: MetaKANs为KANs提供了一种更高效、可扩展的训练方法，缩小了与MLPs的训练成本差距。

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer a novel
framework for function approximation by replacing traditional neural network
weights with learnable univariate functions. This design demonstrates
significant potential as an efficient and interpretable alternative to
traditional MLPs. However, KANs are characterized by a substantially larger
number of trainable parameters, leading to challenges in memory efficiency and
higher training costs compared to MLPs. To address this limitation, we propose
to generate weights for KANs via a smaller meta-learner, called MetaKANs. By
training KANs and MetaKANs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, MetaKANs
achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters and maintaining promising interpretability.
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark tasks, including symbolic
regression, partial differential equation solving, and image classification,
demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaKANs in improving parameter efficiency and
memory usage. The proposed method provides an alternative technique for
training KANs, that allows for greater scalability and extensibility, and
narrows the training cost gap with MLPs stated in the original paper of KANs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical

synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from

execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在动态概率模型中加速推断的方法，通过仅使用概率最高的前p个状态（top-p状态）来减少计算量和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态概率模型中的推断任务复杂且计算昂贵，特别是在隐马尔可夫模型中，需要枚举整个状态空间，导致计算效率低下和噪声增加。

Method: 提出使用top-p状态（即累积概率为p的最可能状态）来去噪和加速推断。

Result: 理论证明误差受p和模型的最小混合率限制；实验显示速度提升至少一个数量级，总变差距离误差低于0.09。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了计算复杂性和噪声，同时保持了推断的准确性。

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联邦学习（FL）中的设备调度策略FedCGD，通过最小化设备级和样本级的集体梯度发散（CGD）来提升收敛速度，并在CIFAR-10数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中应用联邦学习时，数据异构性和带宽限制是两大挑战。现有研究多关注单个设备的数据异构性，而本文证明FL的收敛速度受设备级和样本级CGD的共同影响。

Method: 通过将设备级CGD转化为分类问题中的加权地球移动距离（WEMD），并考虑样本级CGD的统计上界，提出FedCGD算法，在多项式时间内平衡WEMD和采样方差。

Result: 实验表明，FedCGD在CIFAR-10数据集上分类准确率提升高达4.2%，同时调度设备数量减少41.8%，并能灵活调整WEMD和采样方差的优化目标。

Conclusion: FedCGD通过多级CGD优化，显著提升了FL的收敛速度和性能，为无线网络中的联邦学习提供了高效调度方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

TL;DR: MIRA是一个专为医学时间序列设计的统一基础模型，通过创新技术解决了医学数据的挑战，显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学时间序列数据具有不规则间隔、异质采样率和频繁缺失值等固有挑战，现有通用模型难以处理。

Method: MIRA结合了连续时间旋转位置编码、频率特定专家混合层和基于神经ODE的连续动态外推块。

Result: MIRA在公开数据集上预训练后，预测误差平均降低10%（分布外）和7%（分布内）。

Conclusion: MIRA为医学时间序列建模提供了新基准，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open
access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to
reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust
transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in
data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist
time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due
to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous
sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical
time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional
Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a
frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across
latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a
Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the
continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at
arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical
corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available
datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10%
and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when
compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a
comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks,
establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.

Result: 实验表明，ATRADA能有效生成高质量合成轨迹数据，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ATRADA为飞机轨迹数据增强提供了有效解决方案，提升了数据集的多样性和平衡性。

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management
(ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict
detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the
addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a
more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is
sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework,
a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory
dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned
latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into
reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data
points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from
the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original
dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several
experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new,
high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the
results of several baselines.

Motivation: PEFT方法虽高效，但设计空间大，配置不当会导致性能不佳，传统搜索方法开销大。

Method: 将PEFT策略搜索视为剪枝问题，采用混合剪枝策略迭代去除冗余模块。

Result: 显著降低计算负担，优化配置，提升效率。

Conclusion: PrunePEFT是一种高效、可扩展的PEFT策略搜索方法。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理强凸损失时存在性能差距，尤其是在延迟反馈情况下，需要更高效的算法。

Result: 新算法实现了更优的遗憾界，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法在处理延迟反馈和曲率损失时表现出色，填补了现有方法的性能差距。

Abstract: In this work, we study the online convex optimization problem with curved
losses and delayed feedback. When losses are strongly convex, existing
approaches obtain regret bounds of order $d_{\max} \ln T$, where $d_{\max}$ is
the maximum delay and $T$ is the time horizon. However, in many cases, this
guarantee can be much worse than $\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$ as obtained by a
delayed version of online gradient descent, where $d_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the
total delay. We bridge this gap by proposing a variant of
follow-the-regularized-leader that obtains regret of order
$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$, where $\sigma_{\max}$ is
the maximum number of missing observations. We then consider exp-concave losses
and extend the Online Newton Step algorithm to handle delays with an adaptive
learning rate tuning, achieving regret $\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T,
\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$ where $n$ is the dimension. To our knowledge, this
is the first algorithm to achieve such a regret bound for exp-concave losses.
We further consider the problem of unconstrained online linear regression and
achieve a similar guarantee by designing a variant of the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth
forecaster with a clipping trick. Finally, we implement our algorithms and
conduct experiments under various types of delay and losses, showing an
improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: TwinBreak提供了一种高效且低成本的LLM安全机制绕过方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable
benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like
ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated
into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social
risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as
requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often
include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts.
However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often
require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in
excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method.
Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded
backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this
functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak
performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and
safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from
prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety
parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts.
Experiments confirm TwinBreak's effectiveness, achieving 89% to 98% success
rates with minimal computational requirements across 16 LLMs from five vendors.

Conclusion: FuXi-Air为智能城市管理提供了技术参考，展示了多模态数据驱动模型在空气质量预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Air pollution has emerged as a major public health challenge in megacities.
Numerical simulations and single-site machine learning approaches have been
widely applied in air quality forecasting tasks. However, these methods face
multiple limitations, including high computational costs, low operational
efficiency, and limited integration with observational data. With the rapid
advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a
low-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.
An air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this
study based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality
forecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates
meteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data
under the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive
prediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model
successfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an
hourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In
terms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms
the mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.
Ablation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although
meteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories
do, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting
precision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing
pollution mechanisms across megacities. This study provides both a technical
reference and a practical example for applying multimodal data-driven models to
air quality forecasting and offers new insights into building hybrid
forecasting systems to support air pollution risk warning in smart city
management.

Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory
chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and
reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to
the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough
understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever
transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200
process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our
experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process
conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on
solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically
and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking
for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering,
and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement
and sustainable manufacturing.

Result: Stable-ChebNet在多个基准测试中接近最优性能。

Conclusion: Stable-ChebNet解决了ChebNet的训练不稳定问题，同时保持了其在长距离任务中的优势。

Abstract: ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their
simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their
success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies
between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make
use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that
characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically
disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original
introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant
node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive
advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while
maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we
uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime
during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and
non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our
Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has
controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions,
positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks,
Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 泛化性能由假设类的权重决定，而非其大小。简单模型权重高，泛化性能好；复杂模型反之。随机梯度下降与Langevin动力学可近似理论学习器。

Conclusion: 研究提供了过参数化模型泛化良好的理论解释，统一了多种学习场景的理解，并与实际概念（如平坦最小值和模型蒸馏）一致。

Abstract: A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large,
over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend
to generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number
of training samples.
  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory,
grounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian
mixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive
hypothesis class.
  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the
overall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability
of all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the
true data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the
weight of the hypothesis.
  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those
with large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex
models have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a
rigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often
avoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to
concentrate on them when supported by the data.
  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient
descent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution,
enabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine
learning methods combined with ensemble learning.
  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical
concepts such as flat minima and model distillation. The results apply broadly
across online, batch, and supervised learning settings, offering a unified and
principled understanding of the generalization behavior of modern AI systems.

TL;DR: ProARD提出了一种动态网络训练方法，通过一次性训练支持多种轻量级学生网络，避免了重复训练的高成本和碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ARD方法需要为不同资源约束的设备重新训练学生网络，导致高计算成本和碳排放。

Method: 基于动态层构建动态网络，通过权重共享机制联合优化动态教师网络及其内部学生网络，并采用采样机制降低计算成本。

Result: 随机采样学生网络无法产生准确且鲁棒的学生网络。

Conclusion: ProARD提供了一种高效且环保的解决方案，支持多样化学生网络的训练。

Abstract: Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method
to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against
adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust
teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the
diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches
require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific
constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2
emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation
(ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that
supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without
requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on
dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in
each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider
the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network.
ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly
optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks.
However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for
all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required
to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each
iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了11种基准预测方法，发现随机采样加回归模型表现优于多数现有方法，且所有方法依赖模型相似性。提出新方法在部分情况下优于随机采样平均，但效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）评估成本高，需快速评估方法，通过缩减基准数据集来预测整体性能。

Method: 系统评估11种基准预测方法在19个基准上的表现，提出随机采样加回归模型作为基线，并引入新方法（基于增强逆倾向加权）。

Result: 现有方法依赖模型相似性，在模型性能超出已知范围时效果显著下降；新方法在部分情况下优于随机采样平均。

Conclusion: 基准预测在评估前沿（新模型能力未知时）效果有限，亟需改进。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluation is increasingly costly, prompting
interest in methods that speed up evaluation by shrinking benchmark datasets.
Benchmark prediction (also called efficient LLM evaluation) aims to select a
small subset of evaluation points and predict overall benchmark performance
from that subset. In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and
limitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks.
First, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit
a regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most
existing methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset
selection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all
existing methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when
interpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark
prediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than
previously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous
methods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over
the sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse
propensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample
average even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model
similarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark
prediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where
the goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.

Result: 通过提出的方法，增强了LDMs在处理多样化文本提示时的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文为LDMs的鲁棒性研究提供了新方法和评估工具。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks, including image generation and video synthesis. However, they
generally lack robustness, a limitation that remains not fully explored in
current research. In this paper, we propose several methods to address this
gap. First, we hypothesize that the robustness of LDMs primarily should be
measured without their text encoder, because if we take and explore the whole
architecture, the problems of image generator and text encoders wll be fused.
Second, we introduce novel data augmentation techniques designed to reveal
robustness shortcomings in LDMs when processing diverse textual prompts. We
then fine-tune Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion XL models using
Dreambooth, incorporating these proposed augmentation methods across multiple
tasks. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation pipeline specifically tailored to
assess the robustness of LDMs fine-tuned via Dreambooth.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

Motivation: 现有离线HRL方法在任务时间跨度增加时效率下降，且缺乏跨轨迹状态转移的有效策略。

Result: GAS在运动、导航和操作任务中优于现有方法，关键任务得分从1.0提升至88.3。

Conclusion: GAS通过图搜索和状态聚类显著提升了离线HRL的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法不仅收敛速度快，还能保证解释性和独立性，适用于下游因果推断。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Result: 在16个基线方法和多个数据集上的实验表明，EMD-CFL具有优越的聚类性能。

Conclusion: EMD-CFL为解决联邦学习中的非独立同分布数据问题提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used framework for machine learning in
distributed data environments where clients hold data that cannot be easily
centralised, such as for data protection reasons. FL, however, is known to be
vulnerable to non-IID data. Clustered FL addresses this issue by finding more
homogeneous clusters of clients. We propose a novel one-shot clustering method,
EMD-CFL, using the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) between data distributions in
embedding space. We theoretically motivate the use of EMDs using results from
the domain adaptation literature and demonstrate empirically superior
clustering performance in extensive comparisons against 16 baselines and on a
range of challenging datasets.

Conclusion: 该集成方法为安全关键领域开发可信赖且鲁棒的深度学习模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Conclusion: Jarzynski重加权是一种有潜力的工具，可用于改进EBMs的训练效果，核选择是关键因素。

Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) provide a flexible framework for generative
modeling, but their training remains theoretically challenging due to the need
to approximate normalization constants and efficiently sample from complex,
multi-modal distributions. Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence
and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this
work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training
EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these
theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based
diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of
stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample
quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in
correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights
into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting
the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative
learning.

Conclusion: RR-GNN通过创新方法显著提升了预测效率，同时保证了统计覆盖性，适用于高风险领域的图数据建模。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的边界紧致且具有实际意义，适用于多种公平性学习算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计提升公平性泛化能力的算法提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

<details>

Motivation: 1型糖尿病需要持续监测血糖，但现有预测模型在穿戴设备上部署困难，计算和内存限制是主要挑战。

Method: 结合Transformer的注意力机制和循环神经网络的序列处理能力，设计了一种轻量级模型，并优化了损失函数以处理数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在OhioT1DM和DiaTrend数据集上的实验表明，该模型在血糖预测和不良事件检测上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了高性能模型与实际部署之间的空白，为T1D管理提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Motivation: 随着注意力模型规模和复杂度的增加，故障诊断变得更具挑战性，需要更有效的分析方法。

Method: 使用Hessian矩阵分析（曲率分析和参数交互分析）来识别注意力机制中的脆弱区域和参数依赖关系。

Result: 在三种模型（HAN、3D-CNN、DistilBERT）上的实验表明，Hessian指标比梯度更能定位不稳定性和故障源。

Conclusion: Hessian指标可显著改进复杂神经架构的故障诊断，提升软件调试实践。

Abstract: As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity,
diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we
conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis
for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use
Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis)
and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within
attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN,
DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and
pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical
findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis
in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging
practices.

Result: 首次在扩散模型中实现高级语义身份保留，展示了语义控制在因果控制与身份保留之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为反事实图像编辑提供了新方法，平衡了因果控制与身份保留的需求。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and
flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data
such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical
applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous
functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce
$\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function
spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder
architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate
continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly
incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural
constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples
satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax
optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that
diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable
regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff
across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical
results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high
fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and
low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态数据生成提供了一种更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Conclusion: CausalPFN是一个即用型模型，无需额外训练或调优，推动了因果推断的自动化。

Abstract: Causal effect estimation from observational data is fundamental across
various applications. However, selecting an appropriate estimator from dozens
of specialized methods demands substantial manual effort and domain expertise.
We present CausalPFN, a single transformer that amortizes this workflow:
trained once on a large library of simulated data-generating processes that
satisfy ignorability, it infers causal effects for new observational datasets
out-of-the-box. CausalPFN combines ideas from Bayesian causal inference with
the large-scale training protocol of prior-fitted networks (PFNs), learning to
map raw observations directly to causal effects without any task-specific
adjustment. Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous
and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC).
Moreover, it shows competitive performance for real-world policy making on
uplift modeling tasks. CausalPFN provides calibrated uncertainty estimates to
support reliable decision-making based on Bayesian principles. This
ready-to-use model does not require any further training or tuning and takes a
step toward automated causal inference (https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN).

Result: 最小非线性在多种任务中表现最优，模型更简单、鲁棒且可解释。

Conclusion: 为选择性引入非线性提供理论框架，连接动力学系统理论与循环神经网络的功能需求。

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

Result: 实验表明，W4S4在延迟重构任务、分类基准和长序列建模中优于HiPPO-based SSM，信息保留能力更强。

Conclusion: W4S4为下一代深度SSM模型提供了可扩展且高效的基础，小波框架的初始化方法显著优于现有方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful components for sequence
modeling, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies via linear
recurrence and convolutional computation. However, their effectiveness depends
heavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we
build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new
variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant
wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel
computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both
theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS
retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based
SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4.
Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction
tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming
that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state
dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS
provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep
SSM-based models.

Conclusion: PIESMC能高效构建驾驶循环，准确复现实验数据的中心趋势和变异性。

Abstract: Accurate driving cycle construction is crucial for vehicle design, fuel
economy analysis, and environmental impact assessments. A generative
Physics-Informed Expected SARSA-Monte Carlo (PIESMC) approach that constructs
representative driving cycles by capturing transient dynamics, acceleration,
deceleration, idling, and road grade transitions while ensuring model fidelity
is introduced. Leveraging a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework
with Monte Carlo sampling, PIESMC delivers efficient cycle construction with
reduced computational cost. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that PIESMC replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, achieving
up to a 57.3% reduction in cumulative kinematic fragment errors compared to the
Micro-trip-based (MTB) method and a 10.5% reduction relative to the
Markov-chain-based (MCB) method. Moreover, it is nearly an order of magnitude
faster than conventional techniques. Analyses of vehicle-specific power
distributions and wavelet-transformed frequency content further confirm its
ability to reproduce experimental central tendencies and variability.

Motivation: 传统集成模型（如随机生存森林和梯度提升）在生存分析中因数据删失和样本变化导致预测不稳定，需要一种更稳健的方法。

Method: SurvBESA结合Beran估计器和自注意力机制，通过对预测生存函数应用自注意力来平滑噪声，并探索了使用Huber污染模型简化训练的方法。

Result: 数值实验表明，SurvBESA优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: SurvBESA是一种有效的生存分析模型，其实现已公开。

Abstract: Survival analysis predicts the time until an event of interest, such as
failure or death, but faces challenges due to censored data, where some events
remain unobserved. Ensemble-based models, like random survival forests and
gradient boosting, are widely used but can produce unstable predictions due to
variations in bootstrap samples. To address this, we propose SurvBESA (Survival
Beran Estimators Self-Attended), a novel ensemble model that combines Beran
estimators with a self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods,
SurvBESA applies self-attention to predicted survival functions, smoothing out
noise by adjusting each survival function based on its similarity to
neighboring survival functions. We also explore a special case using Huber's
contamination model to define attention weights, simplifying training to a
quadratic or linear optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that
SurvBESA outperforms state-of-the-art models. The implementation of SurvBESA is
publicly available.

Motivation: 研究如何绕过文本分类保护模型，揭示其漏洞，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过操纵输入文本利用分词策略，使保护模型误分类，同时目标仍能理解文本。

Result: 成功绕过保护模型，揭示模型家族与漏洞的关联，并提出无需重新训练的保护策略。

Conclusion: TokenBreak攻击有效，需改进分词策略以增强模型安全性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used for text-related tasks such
as classification and generation. To complete these tasks, input data is first
tokenized from human-readable text into a format the model can understand,
enabling it to make inferences and understand context. Text classification
models can be implemented to guard against threats such as prompt injection
attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), toxic input and cybersecurity
risks such as spam emails. In this paper, we introduce TokenBreak: a novel
attack that can bypass these protection models by taking advantage of the
tokenization strategy they use. This attack technique manipulates input text in
such a way that certain models give an incorrect classification. Importantly,
the end target (LLM or email recipient) can still understand and respond to the
manipulated text and therefore be vulnerable to the very attack the protection
model was put in place to prevent. The tokenizer is tied to model architecture,
meaning it is possible to predict whether or not a model is vulnerable to
attack based on family. We also present a defensive strategy as an added layer
of protection that can be implemented without having to retrain the defensive
model.

Conclusion: 论文提出的成本感知策略在有限预算下显著提高了标注效率，特别适用于样本难度差异大的任务。

Abstract: The development lifecycle of generative AI systems requires continual
evaluation, data acquisition, and annotation, which is costly in both resources
and time. In practice, rapid iteration often makes it necessary to rely on
synthetic annotation data because of the low cost, despite the potential for
substantial bias. In this paper, we develop novel, cost-aware methods for
actively balancing the use of a cheap, but often inaccurate, weak rater -- such
as a model-based autorater that is designed to automatically assess the quality
of generated content -- with a more expensive, but also more accurate, strong
rater alternative such as a human. More specifically, the goal of our approach
is to produce a low variance, unbiased estimate of the mean of the target
"strong" rating, subject to some total annotation budget. Building on recent
work in active and prediction-powered statistical inference, we derive a family
of cost-optimal policies for allocating a given annotation budget between weak
and strong raters so as to maximize statistical efficiency. Using synthetic and
real-world data, we empirically characterize the conditions under which these
policies yield improvements over prior methods. We find that, especially in
tasks where there is high variability in the difficulty of examples, our
policies can achieve the same estimation precision at a far lower total
annotation budget than standard evaluation methods.

Conclusion: 这是首个针对cPIKANs的系统性NTK研究，为其经验性能提供了理论解释和预测。

Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their
Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training
dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically
and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding
of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our
objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout
gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We
first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend
the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral
properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and
spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz
equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations
governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation
into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,
second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the
resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in
the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also
reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel
behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing
theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速流体流动（如接近或超过音速的流动）会出现激波等突变现象，传统均匀时间步长方法难以捕捉这些现象，因此需要自适应时间步长方法。

Conclusion: ShockCast是首个用于学习高速流体流动的框架，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling high-speed flows using machine learning
methods. While most prior studies focus on low-speed fluid flows in which
uniform time-stepping is practical, flows approaching and exceeding the speed
of sound exhibit sudden changes such as shock waves. In such cases, it is
essential to use adaptive time-stepping methods to allow a temporal resolution
sufficient to resolve these phenomena while simultaneously balancing
computational costs. Here, we propose a two-phase machine learning method,
known as ShockCast, to model high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping. In
the first phase, we propose to employ a machine learning model to predict the
timestep size. In the second phase, the predicted timestep is used as an input
along with the current fluid fields to advance the system state by the
predicted timestep. We explore several physically-motivated components for

TL;DR: 论文提出HeuriGym框架，用于评估LLM在组合优化问题中的启发式算法生成能力，并引入QYI指标量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分衡量LLM在复杂问题解决中的能力，需要更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 设计HeuriGym框架，让LLM生成启发式算法并通过代码执行反馈迭代优化，评估9个先进模型在9个问题上的表现。

Result: 即使顶级模型QYI得分仅0.6，远低于专家基准1，显示LLM在工具使用、规划和自适应推理上的局限性。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLM在科学和工程领域的实际应用提供了评估基准，推动其进一步发展。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Lyapunov谱（LS）的距离度量方法，用于高效选择适合的剪枝策略（hyperpruning），显著减少了搜索时间，并在实验中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对过参数化循环神经网络剪枝策略选择的高计算成本和缺乏早期性能保证的问题，提出了一种新的解决方案。

Method: 引入基于Lyapunov谱（LS）的距离度量，结合超参数优化算法，提出LSH框架，用于高效选择剪枝策略。

Result: 在多个网络架构和数据集上，LSH方法在固定训练预算和目标剪枝比例下，能选择出性能优于传统方法的剪枝模型，甚至超过原始密集模型的性能。

Conclusion: LSH框架为网络剪枝提供了一种高效且性能优越的策略选择方法，显著提升了剪枝模型的性能表现。

Abstract: A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized
Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption
and storage utilization. These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed
`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for
a given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional
hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains
uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model
sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to
discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.
However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally
expensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early
comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of
post-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard
hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning
framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an
order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full
training. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn
Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under
fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies
superior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform
those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their
dense counterpart.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）训练效果和稳定性是当前AI领域的重要挑战，需要一种更有效的训练方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of
artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models
remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this
challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that
uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a
fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral
properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function
with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in
training LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的测试时扩展维度——交互扩展（TTI），通过增加代理的交互范围，使其能够执行探索、回溯和动态重新规划等行为。该方法在Web代理领域验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展范式依赖于生成长推理痕迹（“思考”更多），但无法让代理从环境中获取新信息或随时间调整行为。因此，研究探索交互扩展的潜力。

Method: 提出TTI方法，基于课程学习的在线强化学习（RL），通过自适应调整代理的交互范围（如探索和回溯）来训练代理。使用Gemma 3 12B模型验证。

Result: TTI在WebVoyager和WebArena基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了代理在探索与利用之间的自适应平衡能力。

Conclusion: 交互扩展是计算扩展的有力补充，为训练自适应代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

Result: 在巴塞罗那真实数据测试中，DesRUTGe比RouteSampler等现有方法更准确且隐私保护更好。

Conclusion: DesRUTGe为城市规划和智能交通系统提供了一种高效、隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban
planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However,
generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect
real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major
challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy,
scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This
work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a
novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with
the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key
innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL),
wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an
independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal
historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging
model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones),
without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from
the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as
RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering
more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.

Result: 现有方法主要通过记忆训练检查点生成权重，无法超越简单基线，且改进措施（如数据增强）效果有限。

Conclusion: 生成模型在新领域的应用需更谨慎评估，当前方法在权重生成方面表现不佳。

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents a sophisticated multi-day turnover quantitative trading
algorithm that integrates advanced deep learning techniques with comprehensive
cross-sectional stock prediction for the Chinese A-share market. Our framework
combines five interconnected modules: initial stock selection through deep
cross-sectional prediction networks, opening signal distribution analysis using
mixture models for arbitrage identification, market capitalization and
liquidity-based dynamic position sizing, grid-search optimized profit-taking
and stop-loss mechanisms, and multi-granularity volatility-based market timing
models. The algorithm employs a novel approach to balance capital efficiency
with risk management through adaptive holding periods and sophisticated
entry/exit timing. Trained on comprehensive A-share data from 2010-2020 and
rigorously backtested on 2021-2024 data, our method achieves remarkable
performance with 15.2\% annualized returns, maximum drawdown constrained below
5\%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.87. The strategy demonstrates exceptional
scalability by maintaining 50-100 daily positions with a 9-day maximum holding
period, incorporating dynamic profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms that
enhance capital turnover efficiency while preserving risk-adjusted returns. Our
approach exhibits robust performance across various market regimes while
maintaining high capital capacity suitable for institutional deployment.

Abstract: The ACM Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) is a venue that welcomes and compares
systems that support the exploration of lifelog data, and in particular the
retrieval of specific information, through an interactive competition format.
This paper reviews the recent advances in interactive lifelog retrieval as
demonstrated at the ACM LSC from 2022 to 2024. Through a detailed comparative
analysis, we highlight key improvements across three main retrieval tasks:
known-item search, question answering, and ad-hoc search. Our analysis
identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval
methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models
(LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and
collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval
techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance,
emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability.
Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show
promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can
enhance usability and efficiency. Additionally, we recommend reconsidering
multi-instance system evaluations within the expert track to better manage
variability in user familiarity and configuration effectiveness.

Conclusion: Hype Index是一种有效的金融分析工具，尤其在市场信号和波动分析方面表现突出。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power
for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including
correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index
family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market

Result: Delphyne在公开数据集上表现出色，性能优于现有基础模型和全样本模型。

Conclusion: Delphyne通过针对性预训练解决了金融时间序列建模的挑战，展现出广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic
speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the
Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized
midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we
demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the
complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in

Method: 提出优化框架，设计两种可调水印（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），通过随机侧信息最大化检测概率并最小化文本失真。

Result: 实验表明，两种水印在低熵任务中能高效检测且对文本质量影响小，同时揭示了水印与编码理论的新联系。

Conclusion: HeavyWater和SimplexWater为LLM水印提供了高效、可调的解决方案，适用于低熵任务。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

Motivation: 由于API访问成为与LLM交互的主要方式，用户通常面对缺乏透明度的黑盒系统，提供商可能为了降低成本或恶意修改模型行为而暗中替换模型，影响性能和安全性。

Method: 采用了一种基于排名的均匀性测试方法，该方法准确、查询高效，且避免可检测的查询模式，对抗性提供商难以察觉。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测黑盒LLM的行为变化，为模型透明度和安全性提供了实用工具。

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在现实应用中的部署引发安全问题，隐性危害（无害输入的错误回答）被忽视，需系统性研究。

Method: 提出JailFlipBench基准，覆盖多模态和事实扩展场景，开发JailFlip攻击方法，评估开源和黑盒LLMs。

Result: 发现隐性危害具有现实风险，现有安全评估不足，需超越传统越狱范式。

Conclusion: 呼吁更广泛的LLM安全评估和对齐，以应对隐性危害的紧迫风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

Conclusion: Amatriciana是一种高效且准确的洗钱检测方法，尤其在减少误报方面表现出色。

Abstract: Money laundering is a financial crime that poses a serious threat to
financial integrity and social security. The growing number of transactions
makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies
detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel
approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a
graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the
whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based
subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our
experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited
amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms
other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the
number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary,
Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55%
with respect to other State-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: TimeWak为多变量时间序列扩散模型提供了高效的水印解决方案，同时保持高数据质量和可检测性。

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于统一术语并更全面地理解LLM中毒攻击的安全风险。

Abstract: With the widespread availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
and their training datasets, concerns about the security risks associated with
their usage has increased significantly. One of these security risks is the
threat of LLM poisoning attacks where an attacker modifies some part of the LLM
training process to cause the LLM to behave in a malicious way. As an emerging
area of research, the current frameworks and terminology for LLM poisoning
attacks are derived from earlier classification poisoning literature and are
not fully equipped for generative LLM settings. We conduct a systematic review
of published LLM poisoning attacks to clarify the security implications and
address inconsistencies in terminology across the literature. We propose a
comprehensive poisoning threat model applicable to categorize a wide range of
LLM poisoning attacks. The poisoning threat model includes four poisoning
attack specifications that define the logistics and manipulation strategies of
an attack as well as six poisoning metrics used to measure key characteristics
of an attack. Under our proposed framework, we organize our discussion of
published LLM poisoning literature along four critical dimensions of LLM
poisoning attacks: concept poisons, stealthy poisons, persistent poisons, and
poisons for unique tasks, to better understand the current landscape of
security risks.

Abstract: In this paper we present a study on using novel data types to perform cyber
risk quantification by estimating the likelihood of a data breach. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to build a highly accurate cyber risk
assessment model using public and readily available technology signatures
obtained from crawling an organization's website. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous similar approaches that relied on large-scale IP
address based scanning data, which suffers from incomplete/missing IP address
mappings as well as the lack of such data for large numbers of small and
medium-sized organizations (SMEs). In comparison to scan data, technology
digital signature data is more readily available for millions of SMEs. Our
study shows that there is a strong relationship between these technology
signatures and an organization's cybersecurity posture. In cross-validating our
model using different cyber incident datasets, we also highlight the key
differences between ransomware attack victims and the larger population of
cyber incident and data breach victims.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦多智能体深度强化学习（FMADRL）的移动目标防御（MTD）框架，用于无人机群网络中的主动和自适应DoS缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机群网络的开放无线环境、动态拓扑和资源限制使其面临严重的DoS威胁，传统静态或集中式防御机制难以应对。

Method: 设计了三种轻量级协调的MTD机制（领导者切换、路由变异和频率跳变），并将防御问题建模为多智能体部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，攻击缓解率提高34.6%，平均恢复时间减少94.6%，能耗和防御成本分别降低29.3%和98.3%。

Conclusion: FMADRL驱动的MTD框架在动态和分布式无人机群网络中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a privacy-oriented alternative to
centralized Machine Learning, enabling collaborative model training without
direct data sharing. While extensively studied for neural networks, the
security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored.
This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction
attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried
out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using
split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other
clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient
boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare,
and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a
publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently
reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all
implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it
partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model
performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms
specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide
preliminary insights into their design.

Motivation: 电动汽车充电基础设施的安全性至关重要，现有方法在充电后期才进行识别，导致恶意行为可能消耗大量能源。早期识别方法的需求迫切，同时充电数据隐私问题也需关注。

Method: 通过提取早期充电阶段的电压特征，提出了一种轻量级模型，用于快速识别电动汽车。

Result: 在49辆EV的7408次充电数据上测试，准确率达到0.86，仅需10个关键特征即可实现接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为电动汽车认证提供了新方法，但也警示了充电数据隐私泄露的风险。

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining adoption as a sustainable
alternative to fuel-powered vehicles, making secure charging infrastructure
essential. Despite traditional authentication protocols, recent results showed
that attackers may steal energy through tailored relay attacks. One
countermeasure is leveraging the EV's fingerprint on the current exchanged
during charging. However, existing methods focus on the final charging stage,
allowing malicious actors to consume substantial energy before being detected
and repudiated. This underscores the need for earlier and more effective
authentication methods to prevent unauthorized charging. Meanwhile, profiling
raises privacy concerns, as uniquely identifying EVs through charging patterns
could enable user tracking.
  In this paper, we propose a framework for uniquely identifying EVs using
physical measurements from the early charging stages. We hypothesize that
voltage behavior early in the process exhibits similar characteristics to
current behavior in later stages. By extracting features from early voltage
measurements, we demonstrate the feasibility of EV profiling. Our approach
improves existing methods by enabling faster and more reliable vehicle
identification. We test our solution on a dataset of 7408 usable charges from
49 EVs, achieving up to 0.86 accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows that
near-optimal performance is possible with just 10 key features, improving
efficiency alongside our lightweight models. This research lays the foundation
for a novel authentication factor while exposing potential privacy risks from
unauthorized access to charging data.

Abstract: Data reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover the training dataset of a
target model with limited access, have gained increasing attention in recent
years. However, there is currently no consensus on a formal definition of data
reconstruction attacks or appropriate evaluation metrics for measuring their
quality. This lack of rigorous definitions and universal metrics has hindered
further advancement in this field. In this paper, we address this issue in the
vision domain by proposing a unified attack taxonomy and formal definitions of
data reconstruction attacks. We first propose a set of quantitative evaluation
metrics that consider important criteria such as quantifiability, consistency,
precision, and diversity. Additionally, we leverage large language models
(LLMs) as a substitute for human judgment, enabling visual evaluation with an
emphasis on high-quality reconstructions. Using our proposed taxonomy and
metrics, we present a unified framework for systematically evaluating the
strengths and limitations of existing attacks and establishing a benchmark for
future research. Empirical results, primarily from a memorization perspective,
not only validate the effectiveness of our metrics but also offer valuable
insights for designing new attacks.

Conclusion: ChemGraph通过多智能体框架和任务分解，显著提升了原子模拟的效率和可访问性。

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

Conclusion: 论文填补了LLMs在HDL代码生成领域的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

<details>

Motivation: TAGE-SC-L预测器在难预测分支（H2P）上表现不佳，传统方法如扩大表格效果有限，因此需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 使用H2P识别表（HIT）和两个分支特定感知器，结合动态阈值和并行操作，优化H2P分支的预测。

Result: Bullseye预测器将平均MPKI降至3.4045，CycWpPKI降至145.09，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Bullseye预测器有效解决了H2P分支的预测问题，为高性能处理器提供了更优的分支预测方案。

Abstract: Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While
the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical
corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem
from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under
diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction
before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging
the tables offers only marginal improvement.
  We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem
called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a
set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two
branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other
by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in
an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's
sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which
TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache,
and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher
fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI
of 145.09.

Motivation: 标准贝叶斯优化（BO）无法处理分类参数约束，且优化时间随处理器复杂度增加而显著增长，尤其是在FPGA软处理器设计中。

Method: ASPO通过定制BO的数学机制，引入新的协方差核处理分类参数，并通过惩罚获取函数和重用FPGA合成检查点来加速设计评估。

Result: ASPO在BOOM处理器上对“multiply”基准测试的执行时间减少了35%，设计时间比现有方法Boomerang减少了74%。

Conclusion: ASPO成功解决了分类参数约束和优化时间问题，显著提升了FPGA软处理器的设计效率。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown promise in tuning processor design
parameters. However, standard BO does not support constraints involving
categorical parameters such as types of branch predictors and division
circuits. In addition, optimization time of BO grows with processor complexity,
which becomes increasingly significant especially for FPGA-based soft
processors. This paper introduces ASPO, an approach that leverages disjunctive
form to enable BO to handle constraints involving categorical parameters.
Unlike existing methods that directly apply standard BO, the proposed ASPO
method, for the first time, customizes the mathematical mechanism of BO to
address challenges faced by soft-processor designs on FPGAs. Specifically, ASPO
supports categorical parameters using a novel customized BO covariance kernel.
It also accelerates the design evaluation procedure by penalizing the BO
acquisition function with potential evaluation time and by reusing FPGA
synthesis checkpoints from previously evaluated configurations. ASPO targets
three soft processors: RocketChip, BOOM, and EL2 VeeR. The approach is
evaluated based on seven RISC-V benchmarks. Results show that ASPO can reduce
execution time for the ``multiply'' benchmark on the BOOM processor by up to
35\% compared to the default configuration. Furthermore, it reduces design time
for the BOOM processor by up to 74\% compared to Boomerang, a state-of-the-art
hardware-oriented BO approach.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation

and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in

Abstract: Olive production is an important tree crop in Mediterranean climates.
However, olive yield varies significantly due to climate change. Accurately
estimating yield using remote sensing and machine learning remains a complex
challenge. In this study, we developed a streamlined pipeline for olive yield
estimation in the Kairouan and Sousse governorates of Tunisia. We extracted
features from multispectral reflectance bands, vegetation indices derived from
Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-9 OLI-2 satellite imagery, along with digital
elevation model data. These spatial features were combined with ground-based
field survey data to form a structured tabular dataset. We then developed an
automated ensemble learning framework, implemented using AutoGluon to train and
evaluate multiple machine learning models, select optimal combinations through
stacking, and generate robust yield predictions using five-fold
cross-validation. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance from
both sensors, with Landsat-8 OLI achieving R2 = 0.8635 and RMSE = 1.17 tons per
ha, and Landsat-9 OLI-2 achieving R2 = 0.8378 and RMSE = 1.32 tons per ha. This
study highlights a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate method for olive
yield estimation, with potential applicability across diverse agricultural
regions globally.

Conclusion: PMQ方法通过增强患者一致性学习，显著提升了ECG预训练模型的性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the field of automatic Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data, how to build a robust ECG pretrained
model based on unlabeled data is a key area of focus for researchers. Recent
advancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the
potential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals
inherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its
rationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share
commonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative
pairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples
provides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,
these methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the
insufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,
we propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the
Patient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to
mitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter
patient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained
model, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more
perspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data
ratios. The experimental results show that the comprehensive performance of our
method outperforms previous contrastive learning methods and exhibits greater
robustness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The code is available at

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection
and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited
by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a
novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities,
especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived
from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial
detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a
novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features
in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the
geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated
real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and
realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated
and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and
efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of
TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object
detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and
infrastructure management.

Motivation: 传统滤波方法（如LMS、RLS等）在动态非平稳环境中表现受限，需要复杂调参或固定模型假设。

Method: 使用PPO算法，通过复合奖励函数（SNR提升、MSE降低和残差平滑）指导自适应滤波。

Result: 实验表明，PPO代理能泛化到训练分布之外，实时性能优于经典滤波器。

Conclusion: 证明了策略梯度强化学习在低延迟、鲁棒自适应信号滤波中的可行性。

Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are
gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as
wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman
are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or
exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive
filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a
composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual
smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that
our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time
performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the
viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency
adaptive signal filtering.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多视角学习和不确定性融合，显著提升了心律失常分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a deep neural architecture that performs uncertainty-aware
multi-view classification of arrhythmia from ECG. Our method learns two
different views (1D and 2D) of single-lead ECG to capture different types of
information. We use a fusion technique to reduce the conflict between the
different views caused by noise and artifacts in ECG data, thus incorporating
uncertainty to obtain stronger final predictions. Our framework contains the
following three modules (1) a time-series module to learn the morphological
features from ECG; (2) an image-space learning module to learn the
spatiotemporal features; and (3) the uncertainty-aware fusion module to fuse
the information from the two different views. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework not only improves the
performance on arrhythmia classification compared to the state-of-the-art but
also shows better robustness to noise and artifacts present in ECG.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements

beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via

discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code

Motivation: 由于甲烷对全球变暖的显著影响，近期的气候行动需要优先关注甲烷排放。随着越来越多的遥感平台用于甲烷羽流检测，跨平台数据对齐的需求日益增长。

Method: 论文采用迁移学习技术，利用机载AVIRIS-NG数据优化星载EMIT任务的甲烷羽流分类器，并使用CycleGAN进行无监督的图像到图像转换，以对齐机载和星载数据分布。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了甲烷羽流检测的准确性，还展示了如何通过数据驱动的方法对齐不同遥感仪器获取的相关数据。

Abstract: Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its
significant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched
filter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect
methane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned
anthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an
increasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume
detection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this
work, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that
leverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection,
reconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task
across platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data
from the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on
airborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning,
outperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an
unsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data
distributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne
EMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne
classifiers directly yields the best plume detection results. This methodology
is useful not only for data simulation, but also for direct data alignment.
Though demonstrated on the task of methane plume detection, our work more
broadly demonstrates a data-driven approach to align related products obtained
from distinct remote sensing instruments.

Motivation: 解决ECG信号中心跳分类问题，比较传统手工特征与深度学习图像转换方法的性能差异。

Method: 1. 传统机器学习：提取HRV、均值、方差等特征，训练多种分类器；2. 深度学习：将ECG信号转换为图像（GAF、MTF、RP），使用CNN分类。

Result: LightGBM表现最优（准确率99%，F1分数0.94），优于基于图像的CNN方法（F1分数0.85）。

Conclusion: 手工特征能更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空变化，未来可结合多导联信号和时序依赖提升分类效果。

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抛物方程（PE）方法计算成本高，无法满足大规模参数空间的需求；而现有神经网络方法在不利风条件下表现不佳。因此，需要一种更高效且准确的TL预测方法。

Method: 开发了一种优化的卷积神经网络，利用全球模拟的温度和风场数据，预测4000公里范围内的TLs，并通过关键优化提升性能。

Conclusion: 优化的卷积神经网络显著提升了TL预测的效率和准确性，适用于全球范围的次声监测应用。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately detecting drowsiness is vital to driving safety. Among all
measures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more
privacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist
regarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness
labels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms
(ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four
datasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal)
and assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic
regression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are
associated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different
drowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and
objective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting
drowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory
amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased
drowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can
inform future generalizable monitoring designs.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

TL;DR: IQFM是首个基于原始I/Q信号的无线通信基础模型，支持多种任务，无需复杂预处理或手工特征，通过对比自监督学习框架实现高效多任务学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基于原始I/Q信号的基础模型在无线通信中的应用潜力，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 提出IQFM模型，采用任务感知增强策略和对比自监督学习框架，轻量级编码器预训练于多天线I/Q数据。

Result: 在调制分类和AoA分类中分别达到99.67%和65.45%的准确率，仅需每类一个标记样本，显著优于监督基线。

Conclusion: IQFM展示了原始I/Q信号基础模型在6G系统中高效多任务学习的潜力。

Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless
communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such
as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational
models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This
paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless
communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification,
angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy
preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware
augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations,
such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy
forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a
contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the
lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data,
achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification,
respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised
baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to
out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per
class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves
94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a
modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs.
96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational
models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G
systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合条件去噪扩散模型（CDDM）和多模态变换器（MMT）的新框架，用于提升无蜂窝ISAC系统中的信道估计性能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无蜂窝ISAC系统在6G网络中具有潜力，但信道估计受限于导频污染和噪声干扰，需结合感知信息提升性能。

Method: 通过CDDM和MMT结合，利用感知和位置数据的模态间关系，迭代去噪和优化信道估计。

Result: 相比LS和MMSE估计器，NMSE分别提升8 dB和9 dB；相比传统扩散模型，NMSE提升27.8%，且在低SNR和导频污染下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架通过感知信息显著提升信道估计性能，适用于无蜂窝ISAC系统，尤其在用户靠近感知目标时效果更佳。

Abstract: Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize
6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC
capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and
communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free
ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually
limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates.
This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key
input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework,
we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel
estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively
captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling
the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a
27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model
(TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally,
the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains
high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users
near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and
communication channels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型（DM）的可重构智能表面（RIS）辅助系统信道估计方法，通过确定性采样策略和轻量级网络设计，显著提升了性能并降低了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扩散模型在信道估计中的随机性问题，并提升模型的实用性。

Method: 将信道估计问题重新表述为去噪过程，采用确定性采样策略和轻量级U-Net设计。

Result: 在多种信噪比（SNR）下表现优于基线方法，例如在SNR=0 dB时NMSE提升13.5 dB；轻量级网络参数仅为原U-Net的6.59%，性能几乎无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和实用性上均有显著优势，适用于RIS辅助系统的信道估计。

Abstract: This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM)
framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising
process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the
inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we
adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that
ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of
the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves
comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed
method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide
range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves
performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error
(NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost
no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\%
of its parameters.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;

Motivation: 提高对突发性灾害（如地震）的主动准备能力，需要高效的模拟方法。

Method: 使用多模态数据集（地理空间、社会经济、建筑和街景图像数据），结合LLMs生成地震烈度预测，并通过RAG和ICL技术优化性能。

Result: 在2014年Napa和2019年Ridgecrest地震的评估中，预测与实际报告的相关系数为0.88，RMSE为0.77。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟灾害影响方面具有潜力，有助于加强灾前规划。

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在各领域广泛应用，但其与国际人道法的合规性尚未充分研究，需评估其拒绝违法请求的能力及回应质量。

Method: 研究测试了八种主流LLM，评估其对明确违反IHL的提示的拒绝能力，并分析回应的清晰度和帮助性。采用标准化安全提示改进解释质量。

Result: 多数模型能拒绝违法请求，但回应质量不一。标准化提示显著提升解释清晰度，但复杂请求（如技术语言或代码）仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更安全、透明的AI系统提供了基准，并展示了轻量级干预的有效性，但需进一步解决复杂请求的漏洞。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突发事件的专家判断常受结果影响，难以重建事件前的感知，传统测量方法失效。

Method: 使用LLMs进行成对比较提示，生成联邦机构的意识形态分数，并预测裁员目标。

Result: LLMs复现了裁员前的专家测量结果，并预测了裁员目标，同时发现知识机构感知也是预测因素。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为专家调查的替代方案，论文提出了使用LLMs的两部分标准。

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Result: 将任务分为四个区域，揭示了自动化需求和能力的不匹配，并发现人类能力从信息技能转向人际技能的早期信号。

Conclusion: 强调AI代理开发需与人类需求对齐，并为工人适应职场动态变化做好准备。

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Conclusion: LLMs适合辅助表面检查，但需人类监督进行深度经济推理，建议其在同行评审中作为辅助工具。

Abstract: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the
economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial
econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered "counterfactual"
summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a
diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured
binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and
publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly
assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving
an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when
evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall
publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM,
the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two
factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly
for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in
assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in
performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential
assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight.

Motivation: 现有LALMs在标准基准测试中表现良好，但存在对音频内容的幻觉问题，需要一种有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用音频感知解码（AAD），通过对比音频存在与否的token预测概率，优先选择音频存在时概率增加的token。

Result: AAD在对象幻觉数据集上将F1分数提升了0.046至0.428，在通用音频QA数据集上准确率提升了5.4%至10.3%。

Conclusion: AAD是一种有效的轻量级方法，显著减少了LALMs的幻觉问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

Conclusion: SD-CTC有效解决了说话人区分问题，无需辅助信息即可实现高性能多说话人语音识别。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) provides a structured approach to
integrating physical knowledge into data-driven modeling, offering significant
potential for advancing hydrological research. In recent years, multiple
methodological families have emerged, including physics-informed machine
learning, physics-guided machine learning, hybrid physics-machine learning, and
data-driven physics discovery. Within each of these families, a proliferation
of heterogeneous approaches has developed independently, often without
conceptual coordination. This fragmentation complicates the assessment of
methodological novelty and makes it difficult to identify where meaningful
advances can still be made in the absence of a unified conceptual framework.
This review, the first focused overview of SciML in hydrology, addresses these
limitations by proposing a unified methodological framework for each SciML
family, bringing together representative contributions into a coherent
structure that fosters conceptual clarity and supports cumulative progress in
hydrological modeling. Finally, we highlight the limitations and future
opportunities of each unified family to guide systematic research in hydrology,
where these methods remain underutilized.

Motivation: 触觉感知在机器人操作中具有潜力，但由于其局部性，难以单独完成需要全局场景理解的任务。主动感知技术可以弥补这一不足，但目前缺乏标准化基准。

Method: 引入了一个开源的、兼容Gymnasium的基准测试套件，包含多样化的模拟场景和数据集（合成3D MNIST数字模型和真实触觉样本），并训练CycleGAN用于逼真的触觉模拟渲染。

Result: 提供了13,500个合成3D MNIST数字模型和153,600个真实触觉样本的数据集，以及标准化的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该基准测试套件促进了触觉感知和主动感知领域的系统性进展。

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our
benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile
sensing and active perception.

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Abstract: Self-localization is an important technology for automating bulldozers.
Conventional bulldozer self-localization systems rely on RTK-GNSS (Real Time
Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite Systems). However, RTK-GNSS signals are
sometimes lost in certain mining conditions. Therefore, self-localization
methods that do not depend on RTK-GNSS are required. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based self-localization method for bulldozers. The proposed
method consists of two steps: estimating local velocities using a machine
learning model from internal sensors, and incorporating these estimates into an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for global localization. We also created a novel
dataset for bulldozer odometry and conducted experiments across various driving
scenarios, including slalom, excavation, and driving on slopes. The result
demonstrated that the proposed self-localization method suppressed the
accumulation of position errors compared to kinematics-based methods,
especially when slip occurred. Furthermore, this study showed that
bulldozer-specific sensors, such as blade position sensors and hydraulic
pressure sensors, contributed to improving self-localization accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实时分块（RTC）算法，用于解决AI系统在高频控制任务中的延迟问题，通过异步执行动作分块策略，显著提升了任务吞吐量和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统在物理世界交互中需要实时性能，但现有通用模型的高延迟问题导致动作分块策略在边界处出现停顿或不连贯动作。

Method: RTC是一种无需重新训练的推理时算法，适用于任何基于扩散或流的视觉语言动作模型，通过在执行当前动作分块时生成下一个分块，确保动作的平滑执行。

Result: 在12个高动态任务和6个真实世界双手机器人任务中，RTC表现出快速、高效且对延迟鲁棒的特性，显著提升了任务吞吐量和精确任务的成功率。

Conclusion: RTC为解决AI系统实时性能问题提供了一种有效方法，适用于多种任务场景，尤其在存在显著延迟的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

Motivation: 研究动机是理解为何LLM无法同时满足真实性、语义信息守恒、相关知识揭示和知识约束最优性。

Method: 通过将LLM推理建模为“思想拍卖”，利用Green-Laffont定理证明其不可能性。

Result: 结果表明，无法设计出同时满足四个基本属性的推理机制。

Conclusion: 结论为LLM的幻觉问题是根本性的，需在模型架构、训练目标和评估方法上权衡。

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and
evaluation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过平滑似然目标，有效解决了复杂似然景观的挑战，性能优于现有基准。

Abstract: We study the problem of likelihood maximization when the likelihood function
is intractable but model simulations are readily available. We propose a
sequential, gradient-based optimization method that directly models the Fisher
score based on a local score matching technique which uses simulations from a
localized region around each parameter iterate. By employing a linear
parameterization to the surrogate score model, our technique admits a
closed-form, least-squares solution. This approach yields a fast, flexible, and
efficient approximation to the Fisher score, effectively smoothing the
likelihood objective and mitigating the challenges posed by complex likelihood
landscapes. We provide theoretical guarantees for our score estimator,
including bounds on the bias introduced by the smoothing. Empirical results on
a range of synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate the superior
performance of our method compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning distribution families over $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a fundamental problem
in unsupervised learning and statistics. A central question in this setting is
whether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be
(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its
sample complexity. In 2018, Ashtiani et al. reframed \emph{sample
compressibility}, originally due to Littlestone and Warmuth (1986), as a
structural property of distribution classes, proving that it guarantees
PAC-learnability. This discovery subsequently enabled a series of recent
advancements in deriving nearly tight sample complexity bounds for various
high-dimensional open problems. It has been further conjectured that the
converse also holds: every learnable class admits a tight sample compression
scheme.
  In this work, we establish that sample compressible families remain learnable
even from perturbed samples, subject to a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions. We analyze two models of data perturbation: (i) an additive
independent noise model, and (ii) an adversarial corruption model, where an
adversary manipulates a limited subset of the samples unknown to the learner.
Our results are general and rely on as minimal assumptions as possible. We
develop a perturbation-quantization framework that interfaces naturally with
the compression scheme and leads to sample complexity bounds that scale
gracefully with the noise level and corruption budget. As concrete
applications, we establish new sample complexity bounds for learning finite
mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions under both noise and
adversarial perturbations, as well as for learning Gaussian mixture models from
adversarially corrupted samples, resolving two open problems in the literature.

Method: 引入CoSIM，扩展分层半隐式模型为连续框架，采用连续过渡核实现高效训练。

Result: CoSIM在图像生成任务中表现优于现有扩散模型加速方法，尤其在FD-DINOv2上表现突出。

Conclusion: CoSIM为生成模型的多步蒸馏提供了新方法，并在性能上具有优势。

Abstract: Semi-implicit distributions have shown great promise in variational inference
and generative modeling. Hierarchical semi-implicit models, which stack
multiple semi-implicit layers, enhance the expressiveness of semi-implicit
distributions and can be used to accelerate diffusion models given pretrained
score networks. However, their sequential training often suffers from slow
convergence. In this paper, we introduce CoSIM, a continuous semi-implicit
model that extends hierarchical semi-implicit models into a continuous
framework. By incorporating a continuous transition kernel, CoSIM enables
efficient, simulation-free training. Furthermore, we show that CoSIM achieves
consistency with a carefully designed transition kernel, offering a novel
approach for multistep distillation of generative models at the distributional
level. Extensive experiments on image generation demonstrate that CoSIM
performs on par or better than existing diffusion model acceleration methods,
achieving superior performance on FD-DINOv2.

Result: 能够估计冲突趋势并预测未来冲突模式，仅需过去冲突数据。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简洁且强大的冲突分析框架，适用于研究和预测冲突。

Abstract: I present a novel approach to estimating the temporal and spatial patterns of
violent conflict. I show how we can use highly temporally and spatially
disaggregated data on conflict events in tandem with Gaussian processes to
estimate temporospatial conflict trends. These trends can be studied to gain
insight into conflict traps, diffusion and tempo-spatial conflict exposure in
general; they can also be used to control for such phenomenons given other
estimation tasks; lastly, the approach allow us to extrapolate the estimated
tempo-spatial conflict patterns into future temporal units, thus facilitating
powerful, stat-of-the-art, conflict forecasts. Importantly, these results are
achieved via a relatively parsimonious framework using only one data source:
past conflict patterns.

Result: 在多个生物医学数据示例中展示了框架的灵活性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为LSTM模型选择提供了系统且高效的方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种改进的变分自编码器（Half-AVAE），通过结合对抗网络和外部增强项，解决了独立成分分析（ICA）在确定和不确定条件下的挑战，提升了潜在变量的独立性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE在处理潜在变量数量超过观测信号的不确定ICA问题时表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法来增强潜在变量的独立性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过省略编码器并结合对抗训练和结构化先验，VAE在变分推断中具有灵活性，为复杂的ICA任务提供了有效解决方案，推动了在解缠、因果推断和生成建模中的应用。

Abstract: This study advances the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework by addressing
challenges in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) under both determined and
underdetermined conditions, focusing on enhancing the independence and
interpretability of latent variables. Traditional VAEs map observed data to
latent variables and back via an encoder-decoder architecture, but struggle
with underdetermined ICA where the number of latent variables exceeds observed
signals. The proposed Half Adversarial VAE (Half-AVAE) builds on the
encoder-free Half-VAE framework, eliminating explicit inverse mapping to tackle
underdetermined scenarios. By integrating adversarial networks and External
Enhancement (EE) terms, Half-AVAE promotes mutual independence among latent
dimensions, achieving factorized and interpretable representations. Experiments
with synthetic signals demonstrate that Half-AVAE outperforms baseline models,
including GP-AVAE and Half-VAE, in recovering independent components under
underdetermined conditions, as evidenced by lower root mean square errors. The
study highlights the flexibility of VAEs in variational inference, showing that
encoder omission, combined with adversarial training and structured priors,
enables effective solutions for complex ICA tasks, advancing applications in
disentanglement, causal inference, and generative modeling.

Conclusion: 首次提出在存在未观测混杂因素时，样本高效的分位数最优策略学习方法，具有理论保证。

Abstract: We study quantile-optimal policy learning where the goal is to find a policy
whose reward distribution has the largest $\alpha$-quantile for some $\alpha
\in (0, 1)$. We focus on the offline setting whose generating process involves
unobserved confounders. Such a problem suffers from three main challenges: (i)
nonlinearity of the quantile objective as a functional of the reward
distribution, (ii) unobserved confounding issue, and (iii) insufficient
coverage of the offline dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a
suite of causal-assisted policy learning methods that provably enjoy strong
theoretical guarantees under mild conditions. In particular, to address (i) and
(ii), using causal inference tools such as instrumental variables and negative
controls, we propose to estimate the quantile objectives by solving nonlinear
functional integral equations. Then we adopt a minimax estimation approach with
nonparametric models to solve these integral equations, and propose to
construct conservative policy estimates that address (iii). The final policy is
the one that maximizes these pessimistic estimates. In addition, we propose a
novel regularized policy learning method that is more amenable to computation.
Finally, we prove that the policies learned by these methods are
$\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ quantile-optimal under a mild coverage
assumption on the offline dataset. Here, $\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(\cdot)$ omits
poly-logarithmic factors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
sample-efficient policy learning algorithms for estimating the quantile-optimal
policy when there exist unmeasured confounding.

Abstract: Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to
personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the
most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it.
While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer
part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and
challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference.
To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference
Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active
data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via
reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain
provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to
strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its
predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy
towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks,
optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof.
Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian
experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively
targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate
inference along with efficient selection of informative points.

Result: R2-G2在初始训练中表现更优，适用于多种概率模型。

Conclusion: R2-G2为具有多重重参数化应用的模型提供了性能提升。

Abstract: Latent Gaussian variables have been popularised in probabilistic machine
learning. In turn, gradient estimators are the machinery that facilitates
gradient-based optimisation for models with latent Gaussian variables. The
reparameterisation trick is often used as the default estimator as it is simple
to implement and yields low-variance gradients for variational inference. In
this work, we propose the R2-G2 estimator as the Rao-Blackwellisation of the
reparameterisation gradient estimator. Interestingly, we show that the local
reparameterisation gradient estimator for Bayesian MLPs is an instance of the
R2-G2 estimator and Rao-Blackwellisation. This lets us extend benefits of
Rao-Blackwellised gradients to a suite of probabilistic models. We show that
initial training with R2-G2 consistently yields better performance in models
with multiple applications of the reparameterisation trick.

Abstract: We propose an algorithm for change point monitoring in linear causal models
that accounts for interventions. Through a special centralization technique, we
can concentrate the changes arising from causal propagation across nodes into a
single dimension. Additionally, by selecting appropriate intervention nodes
based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can amplify the change magnitude. We
also present an algorithm for selecting the intervention values, which aids in
the identification of the most effective intervention nodes. Two monitoring
methods are proposed, each with an adaptive intervention policy to make a
balance between exploration and exploitation. We theoretically demonstrate the
first-order optimality of the proposed methods and validate their properties
using simulation datasets and two real-world case studies.

Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained
domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained
sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo
(PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and
more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC)
based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics
(SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on
the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD.
Although the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SRNLD (and SRNLMC) and the
acceleration compared to RLD (and PMLC) have been studied in the literature, it
is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to
achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle
(LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is
chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the
boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that
SRNLD can accelerate the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD
with this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC
based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance which
validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到LLM训练中活跃张量仅占GPU内存的1.7%，非活跃张量占用大量内存且长时间未使用，为SSD卸载/预取提供了机会。

Method: 通过前几次迭代分析张量生命周期，生成优化卸载/预取计划，并集成到PyTorch程序中，利用GPUDirect存储直接迁移张量。

Result: 相比现有技术，TERAIO平均提升LLM训练性能1.47倍，达到理想性能的80.7%。

Conclusion: TERAIO通过高效利用SSD扩展GPU内存，显著提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

Result: 在异构图像分类数据集上，pFedSOP优于现有FL和PFL算法。

Conclusion: pFedSOP通过二阶优化有效加速训练并减少通信轮次，提升了PFL的性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to collaboratively
train personalized models tailored to their individual objectives, addressing
the challenge of model generalization in traditional Federated Learning (FL)
due to high data heterogeneity. However, existing PFL methods often require
increased communication rounds to achieve the desired performance, primarily
due to slow training caused by the use of first-order optimization, which has
linear convergence. Additionally, many of these methods increase local
computation because of the additional data fed into the model during the search
for personalized local models. One promising solution to this slow training is
second-order optimization, known for its quadratic convergence. However,
employing it in PFL is challenging due to the Hessian matrix and its inverse.
In this paper, we propose pFedSOP, which efficiently utilizes second-order
optimization in PFL to accelerate the training of personalized models and
enhance performance with fewer communication rounds. Our approach first
computes a personalized local gradient update using the Gompertz function-based
normalized angle between local and global gradient updates, incorporating
client-specific global information. We then use a regularized Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM), computed from this personalized gradient update, as
an approximation of the Hessian to update the personalized models. This
FIM-based second-order optimization speeds up training with fewer communication
rounds by tackling the challenges with exact Hessian and avoids additional data
being fed into the model during the search for personalized local models.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneously partitioned image classification
datasets with partial client participation demonstrate that pFedSOP outperforms
state-of-the-art FL and PFL algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法在生成特定主体图像时存在欠拟合和过拟合问题，导致主体识别不可靠或背景多样性降低。

Method: 提出两种辅助一致性损失：先验一致性正则化损失和主体一致性正则化损失，分别优化非主体图像的噪声预测和主体身份的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP分数、背景多样性和视觉质量上优于DreamBooth，同时保持主体身份。

Conclusion: 通过引入一致性损失，有效平衡了主体保真度和图像多样性，提升了微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种架构与算法协同设计的方法，通过轴导向光栅化和神经排序等技术，显著提升了3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在资源受限设备上的实时渲染性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管3DGS在高质量和高效视图合成方面表现出色，但在资源受限设备上的实时渲染仍面临挑战，主要由于功耗和面积限制。

Method: 论文提出轴导向光栅化以减少重复计算，引入神经排序替代传统硬件排序器，并设计可重构处理阵列和优化的瓦片调度策略。

Result: 实验表明，该设计在保持渲染质量的同时，速度提升23.4~27.8倍，能耗降低28.8~51.4倍。

Conclusion: 该研究为资源受限设备上的3DGS实时渲染提供了高效解决方案，并计划开源设计以推动领域发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯泼溅方法受限于输入分辨率，无法生成比训练视图更精细的细节。本文旨在打破这一限制。

Method: 采用轻量级生成模型预测并细化额外的3D高斯分布，通过Hessian辅助采样策略智能识别需要密集化的区域。

Result: 在单消费级GPU上实现实时推理（0.015秒/次），几何精度和渲染质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种分辨率无关的3D场景增强新范式，计算高效且实用。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

TL;DR: Squeeze3D是一种利用预训练3D生成模型隐式先验知识实现高压缩比3D数据压缩的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D数据压缩方法在高压缩比下难以保持视觉质量，Squeeze3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过可训练映射网络连接预训练编码器和生成模型的潜在空间，将3D数据压缩为紧凑潜在代码，再通过生成模型解压缩。

Result: 实验显示，Squeeze3D在纹理网格、点云和辐射场上的压缩比分别达到2187x、55x和619x，且视觉质量与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: Squeeze3D无需训练对象特定网络，压缩和解压缩延迟低，支持多种3D数据格式，是一种高效灵活的压缩框架。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化黎曼梯度跟踪算法（Q-RGT），用于解决紧凑子流形上的分布式优化问题，通过量化梯度减少通信瓶颈，同时保持与非量化方法相当的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化在紧凑子流形上的效率常受通信瓶颈限制，需一种既能减少通信开销又能保持高效收敛的方法。

Method: 提出Q-RGT算法，利用量化梯度更新局部变量，绕过精确黎曼投影算子的限制。

Result: Q-RGT在量化情况下达到与非量化方法相同的O(1/K)收敛速度，并通过数值实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: Q-RGT在减少通信开销的同时保持了高效收敛，为分布式优化提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization on compact
submanifolds, where a finite sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local
functions is minimized by $n$ agents forming an undirected and connected graph.
However, the efficiency of distributed optimization is often hindered by
communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized
Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local
variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise
allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian
projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative
efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization,
matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we
explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a
function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT
performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication
bottlenecks and computational overhead.

Motivation: 子模函数在多种应用中广泛存在，但现有研究主要局限于集合函数，缺乏对连续和离散域上DS最小化的系统研究。

Method: 通过将DS最小化问题转化为DC最小化问题，提出了一种新的DC算法变体（DCA），并将其应用于离散和连续域。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了DS最小化的适用范围，并提出了一种有效的算法，为实际应用提供了理论支持和实验验证。

Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in
numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two
submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted
to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth
functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that
DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC)
functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC
Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable
theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be
applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer
least squares.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化Power-to-Gas（P2G）系统的经济性运行，结合电池储能系统（BESs）和燃气轮机，解决延迟奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G技术虽能整合间歇性可再生能源，但其经济性运行复杂且效率较低，且现有研究多关注短期，忽略了长期存储潜力。

Method: 通过三个逐步复杂的案例研究，评估了Deep Q-Networks和Proximal Policy Optimization算法，并引入预测整合、奖励函数惩罚和战略成本计算等改进。

Result: 改进后的DRL显著提升了P2G系统的经济性运行能力，解锁了其长期储能潜力。

Conclusion: DRL结合改进方法可有效优化P2G系统的长期运行策略，为可再生能源整合提供新思路。

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

Conclusion: 该框架为端口哈密顿系统提供了一种高效且可解释的控制方法，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

Abstract: Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding
sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand
(template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose
prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation
guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular
alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the
ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a
differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on
shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the
protein binding pocket. We evaluate our approach on a new benchmark of ligand
pairs co-crystallized with the same target and show that it outperforms
standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases
involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.

Abstract: Discrete choice modelling is a theory-driven modelling framework for
understanding and forecasting choice behaviour. To obtain behavioural insights,
modellers test several competing model specifications in their attempts to
discover the 'true' data generation process. This trial-and-error process
requires expertise, is time-consuming, and relies on subjective theoretical
assumptions. Although metaheuristics have been proposed to assist choice
modellers, they treat model specification as a classic optimisation problem,
relying on static strategies, applying predefined rules, and neglecting
outcomes from previous estimated models. As a result, current metaheuristics
struggle to prioritise promising search regions, adapt exploration dynamically,
and transfer knowledge to other modelling tasks. To address these limitations,
we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based framework where an 'agent'
specifies models by estimating them and receiving rewards based on
goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Results demonstrate the agent dynamically adapts
its strategies to identify promising specifications across data generation
processes, showing robustness and potential transferability, without prior
domain knowledge.

allowing us to interpret the model predictions. In high-risk sectors such as
finance, risk is just as important as mean predictions. Throughout this work,
we address the following risk attribution problem: how to fairly allocate the
risk given a model with data? We demonstrate with analysis and empirical
examples that risk can be well allocated by extending the Shapley value
framework.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种应对量化金融中模型不确定性的方法，通过叠加外部“不确定性度量”增强传统目标，并采用子采样策略和优化的随机梯度下降算法，提升了模型稳健性和性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of model uncertainty in quantitative
finance, where decisions in portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and risk
management rely on estimating stochastic models from limited data. In practice,
the unavailability of the true probability measure forces reliance on an
empirical approximation, and even small misestimations can lead to significant
deviations in decision quality. Building on the framework of Klibanoff et al.
(2005), we enhance the conventional objective - whether this is expected
utility in an investing context or a hedging metric - by superimposing an outer
"uncertainty measure", motivated by traditional monetary risk measures, on the
space of models. In scenarios where a natural model distribution is lacking or
Bayesian methods are impractical, we propose an ad hoc subsampling strategy,
analogous to bootstrapping in statistical finance and related to mini-batch
sampling in deep learning, to approximate model uncertainty. To address the
quadratic memory demands of naive implementations, we also present an adapted
stochastic gradient descent algorithm that enables efficient parallelization.
Through analytical, simulated, and empirical studies - including multi-period,
real data and high-dimensional examples - we demonstrate that uncertainty
measures outperform traditional mixture of measures strategies and our
model-agnostic subsampling-based approach not only enhances robustness against
model risk but also achieves performance comparable to more elaborate Bayesian
methods.

Motivation: 集成方法通过结合多个模型提高预测准确性，但传统方法在实现多样性和权重分配上存在局限性。量子计算为集成方法提供了新的可能性。

Method: 使用量子分类器和索引寄存器进行数据编码，通过叠加和控制门实现数据子采样，量子并行执行多样化分类器，并结合经典权重优化。

Result: 实证评估表明该方法有效，提供了性能上的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的量子加权同质集成方法在性能上表现出色，为量子计算在集成学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by
combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among
predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use
identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and
weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models
through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted
homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers
for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers,
enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and
controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse
internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The
method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical
weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in
the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRE-Net通过多模态知识扩展技术，提升红外降水反演的准确性，超越现有领先产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外降水反演算法准确性低，而微波和雷达方法范围有限，促使开发PRE任务以实现更广范围的高精度反演。

Method: 采用两阶段管道：Swath-Distilling阶段通过CoMWE技术传递知识，Full-Disc Adaptation阶段通过Self-MaskTune平衡多模态与红外知识。

Result: PRE-Net在PRE基准测试中表现优异，超越PERSIANN-CCS、PDIR和IMERG等产品。

Conclusion: PRE-Net为红外降水反演提供了更准确、更广覆盖的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LPS的解码方法，用于减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉现象，无需额外训练且兼容多种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉和语言融合方面取得了显著成功，但其输出仍存在与图像内容不符的幻觉现象。

Method: 引入Local Perception Search (LPS)，利用局部视觉先验信息作为值函数来修正解码过程。

Result: 在广泛使用的幻觉基准测试和噪声数据上，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LPS是一种简单、无需训练且通用的方法，能有效抑制多模态大语言模型中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图像生成技术快速发展，但检测方法多为黑箱，缺乏可解释性。MLLMs虽具备分析和推理能力，但在视觉解释与人类推理对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 构建了标注有合成伪影的AI生成图像数据集，并通过多阶段优化策略微调MLLMs，平衡检测准确性、视觉定位和文本解释的连贯性。

Result: 优化后的模型在检测AI生成图像和定位视觉缺陷方面表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了检测性能，还提供了人类可理解的解释，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）因计算成本高和视觉令牌序列的二次复杂度面临挑战，需优化令牌处理以提升效率。

Method: 提出STF方法融合空间相邻令牌以减少序列长度，并引入MBTF模块补充多粒度特征。

Result: 在8个视觉语言基准测试中，仅使用基线25%的视觉令牌即达到或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: STF与MBTF结合有效提升推理效率，同时保持多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The
source code and trained weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法充分评估手术决策任务中所需的精确和复杂分析能力，特别是在生命关键领域。

Method: 引入SAP-Bench数据集，包含1,226个临床验证的手术动作片段，并提出MLLM-SAP框架，利用MLLMs生成下一步动作建议。

Result: 评估了七种先进MLLMs，发现它们在下一步动作预测性能上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: SAP-Bench和MLLM-SAP为手术动作规划任务提供了有效的评估工具，并揭示了现有模型的改进空间。

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在细粒度视觉差异上仍存在幻觉或语义遗漏问题，主要源于训练数据和目标函数的限制。

Method: 提出可控数据生成流程构建MED数据集（50K图像-文本对），并设计带有特征级一致性损失的监督微调框架。

Result: 在Micro Edit Detection基准测试中，方法显著提升了差异检测准确率并减少幻觉，同时在标准视觉语言任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合针对性数据和目标对齐能有效增强MLLMs的细粒度视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs采用静态视觉令牌编码，无法动态迭代或适应上下文，与人类感知的动态性形成鲜明对比。

Method: 提出基于马尔可夫决策过程的推理框架，包含提议视觉动作的推理器和通过多步直接偏好优化（DPO）训练的验证器。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，提高了准确性和推理过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

Result: 在CSL-Daily和Phoenix-2014T数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成的手语词汇顺序正确且语义准确。

Conclusion: GLOS框架通过时间对齐的gloss级条件和TAC模块，显著提升了手语生成的质量。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Motivation: 现有唇读方法提取的视觉特征包含说话人特定属性（如唇形、颜色、纹理），导致虚假相关性，影响准确性和泛化能力。

Method: SIFLip采用隐式解耦和显式解耦模块，利用文本嵌入作为监督信号，并通过说话人识别子任务进一步解耦说话人特征。

Result: 实验表明，SIFLip在多个公开数据集上显著提升了泛化性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SIFLip通过解耦说话人特定特征，有效提升了唇读模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 探索VLM在MM-ICL中的表现，尤其是面对分布变化时的行为。

Method: 提出MM-ICL with Reasoning方法，为每个示例生成答案和推理依据，并在不同数据集和模型上进行实验。

Result: 性能对示例数量、检索方法等因素不敏感，表明VLM未有效利用示例信息。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在MM-ICL中表现有限，需进一步改进以提升任务理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉变换器（ViTs）在医学图像中对对抗性水印攻击的脆弱性，并通过对抗训练提高了防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ViTs在计算机视觉任务中的成功应用，其对抗性攻击的脆弱性尚未在医学图像领域得到充分研究。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降（PGD）生成对抗性水印，测试ViTs和CNNs的脆弱性，并评估对抗训练的效果。

Result: ViTs对对抗性攻击表现脆弱（准确率降至27.6%），但对抗训练能显著提升防御效果（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像中易受对抗性攻击，但对抗训练是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNNs在交通标志识别中的广泛应用，且训练数据来源未知，确保模型安全免受攻击至关重要。

Method: 通过添加微小扰动实施误差最小化攻击，并提出基于非线性变换的数据增强训练方法以提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 攻击使DNNs预测准确率从99.90%降至10.6%，但提出的方法将其恢复至96.05%，检测模型识别攻击成功率超过99%。

Conclusion: 研究表明需采用先进训练方法以抵御数据中毒攻击，提升交通标志识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flood-DamageSense是一种专为洪水灾害后建筑物损坏评估设计的深度学习框架，融合多模态数据，显著提升了损坏分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在洪水灾害后建筑物损坏识别上表现不佳，主要因为洪水破坏的痕迹不明显。

Method: 结合SAR/InSAR数据、高分辨率光学图像和长期洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构，预测建筑物损坏等级、洪水范围和建筑轮廓。

Result: 在Hurricane Harvey数据上测试，F1分数比现有方法提升19个百分点，尤其在“轻微”和“中等”损坏类别表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR全天候能力，为灾后决策提供了更快、更精细的损坏评估。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Result: 模型在胚胎分类中实现了高准确性，同时保持了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究为胚胎选择提供了一种高效且可解释的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Motivation: SO(3)旋转外推在计算机视觉和机器人学中至关重要，但面临噪声观测、复杂动态和长期预测需求等挑战。

Method: 使用神经控制微分方程和Savitzky-Golay路径建模连续时间旋转动态，学习潜在动态系统并保持旋转的几何结构。

Result: 在真实数据实验中，相比现有方法展现出更强的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为SO(3)旋转动态建模提供了一种通用且几何结构保持的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的两阶段时间序列异常检测方法，ViT4TS和VLM4TS，显著提升了检测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏视觉-时间推理能力，无法像人类专家一样识别上下文异常。

Method: 1. ViT4TS：基于轻量级预训练视觉编码器，利用2D时间序列表示定位候选异常；2. VLM4TS：结合全局时间上下文和VLM推理能力，优化候选异常检测。

Result: VLM4TS在未进行时间序列训练的情况下，F1-max得分比最佳基线提升24.6%，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，展示了VLM在时间序列异常检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅在已见图像重建上评估，而心理图像重建对医学和脑机接口应用至关重要。

Method: 使用NSD-Imagery评估多个NSD训练的视觉解码模型（如MindEye1、Brain Diffuser等）在心理图像重建上的表现。

Result: 心理图像重建性能与视觉重建性能脱钩，简单线性解码架构和多模态特征解码表现更好。

Conclusion: 心理图像数据集对实际应用开发至关重要，NSD-Imagery为视觉解码方法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐的实时感知，传统LiDAR处理方法因全扫描处理导致延迟，而流式方法因极坐标几何与卷积不匹配导致性能下降。

Method: PHiM采用局部双向Mamba块进行扇区内空间编码，全局前向Mamba块进行扇区间时序建模，替代卷积和位置编码。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上，PHiM性能优于之前最佳流式检测器10%，且吞吐量翻倍。

Conclusion: PHiM为极坐标流式LiDAR提供了一种高效、高性能的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be
available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

Abstract: To address the challenges of table structure recognition, we propose a novel

Our approach formulates row and column splitting as sequence labeling tasks,
utilizing dual Transformer encoders to capture feature interactions. The
merging process is framed as a grid cell classification task, leveraging an
additional Transformer encoder to ensure accurate and coherent merging. By
eliminating unstable bounding box predictions, our method reduces resolution
loss and computational complexity, achieving high accuracy while maintaining
fast processing speed. Extensive experiments on FinTabNet and PubTabNet
demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing approaches, particularly
in real-world applications. Our method offers a robust, scalable, and efficient
solution for large-scale table recognition, making it well-suited for
industrial deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标模型损失函数引导不足和对抗生成非协作性方面存在局限。

Method: D2R Loss通过对抗分布和干净分布优化增强模型鲁棒性；CAG通过梯度协作生成对抗样本。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和目标模型上实验表明，D2R Loss与CAG能显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss和CAG策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型对抗攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

Motivation: 现有方法（如MPGD）在去噪步骤中仅应用单次梯度更新，限制了恢复的保真度和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务中提升了LPIPS和PSNR，并在嵌入式设备上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: MPGD可作为轻量级、即插即用的恢复模块，适用于无人机和移动机器人等实时视觉感知任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such

Result: 实验表明许多显著性方法对类别标签不敏感，而CASE方法能提供更忠实和类别特定的解释。

Conclusion: CASE方法在诊断测试和保真度测试中表现优于现有方法，解决了显著性方法的类别不敏感问题。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

Motivation: 传统YOLO模型在农业植物检测中因遮挡、不规则结构和背景噪声导致精度下降，STN的仿射变换不足以处理非刚性变形。

Method: 集成TPS的STN用于非刚性空间变换，结合CBAM抑制背景噪声并突出相关特征。

Result: 在PGP数据集上，模型在精度、召回率和mAP上优于STN-YOLO，假阳性减少12%。

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型提升了空间感知能力，适合实时边缘部署，适用于精准农业。

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

Conclusion: DFN和SAM-SVN方法有效解决了域差距和少样本微调问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

### [482] [CoCoA-Mix: Confusion-and-Confidence-Aware Mixture Model for Context Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07484)
*Dasol Hong,Wooju Lee,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoCoA-Mix的混合模型，结合了混淆感知损失（CoA-loss）和置信感知权重（CoA-weights），以提高视觉语言模型在特定任务中的专业化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结的编码器常导致特征不对齐，引发类别混淆，限制了模型的专业化能力。

Method: 使用CoA-loss优化决策边界以减少混淆，并通过CoA-weights调整混合模型中预测的权重以增强泛化。

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-Mix在专业化和泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过改进决策边界和调整预测权重，有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

### [483] [Uncertainty-o: One Model-agnostic Framework for Unveiling Uncertainty in Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07575)
*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-o是一个模型无关的框架，用于评估和揭示大型多模态模型（LMMs）的不确定性，并通过多模态提示扰动和语义不确定性量化来提升下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LMMs被认为比纯语言模型更鲁棒，但其不确定性评估、提示方法和量化仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出Uncertainty-o框架，包括模型无关的不确定性揭示、多模态提示扰动实验和多模态语义不确定性量化。

Result: 在18个基准测试和10种LMMs上验证了Uncertainty-o的有效性，提升了幻觉检测和不确定性感知推理等任务。

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o为LMMs的不确定性评估和下游任务提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

*Jiacheng Shi,Yanfu Zhang,Huajie Shao,Ashley Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现扩散模型API可能被用于生成合成图像，进而训练替代模型，从而实现对黑盒分类模型的提取和对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力可能被恶意利用，带来安全和隐私风险。

Method: 利用扩散模型API生成合成图像，训练替代模型，以最小查询量执行模型提取和对抗攻击。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，方法平均提升27.37%，仅需0.01倍查询量，对抗攻击成功率达98.68%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型API的安全威胁需引起重视，以防止恶意攻击。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

TL;DR: HieraEdgeNet是一种多尺度边缘增强框架，通过三个协同模块显著提升了显微目标（如花粉）的检测精度，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统花粉识别方法效率低且主观性强，现有深度学习模型在显微目标（如花粉）的定位精度上表现不足。

Method: 提出HieraEdgeNet框架，包含三个模块：HEM（多尺度边缘特征提取）、SEF（边缘与语义信息融合）、CSPOKM（细节优化）。

Result: 在120类花粉数据集上，mAP@.5达到0.9501，优于YOLOv12n和RT-DETR等基线模型。

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet通过系统整合边缘信息，为高精度、高效率的显微目标检测提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化时尚推荐提供了可扩展框架，有效结合视觉与流行度线索。

Abstract: We introduce a trend-aware and visually-grounded fashion recommendation
system that integrates deep visual representations, garment-aware segmentation,
semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline
extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic
segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones
(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the
complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a
scalable framework for personalized fashion recommendations that balances
individual style with emerging trends. Our implementation is available at

Result: 在多个VQA数据集上取得最先进性能，显著优于ICL和Vanilla-RAG方法。

Conclusion: RCTS框架通过高质量推理上下文和重排序方法有效提升了LVLMs的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

TL;DR: R3D2是一种轻量级扩散模型，用于在自动驾驶验证中实现逼真的3D资产插入，解决了传统神经重建方法的动态对象操作和可重用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统验证需要多样化和安全关键的测试，传统仿真平台资源密集且存在与现实数据的领域差距，而神经重建方法（如3DGS）虽可扩展但难以处理动态对象。

Method: R3D2通过一步扩散模型生成逼真的渲染效果（如阴影和一致光照），训练数据来自3DGS对象资产，这些资产通过图像条件3D生成模型从真实驾驶数据中生成。

Result: R3D2显著提升了插入资产的真实感，支持文本到3D资产插入和跨场景对象转移，实现了自动驾驶验证的真正可扩展性。

Conclusion: R3D2为自动驾驶仿真提供了可扩展且逼真的解决方案，其数据集和代码将公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖局部特征，缺乏发现更丰富语义先验的能力，因此需要一种能从全局特征中学习语义信息的方法。

Method: LogoSP通过频域中的全局模式分组超点，生成高精度语义伪标签，用于训练分割网络。

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP大幅超越现有无监督方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了无需人工标签即可学习有意义的3D语义信息，全局模式确实能捕捉语义特征。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VIVAT在图像重建（PSNR和SSIM）和文本到图像生成（CLIP分数）上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VIVAT在保持KL-VAE框架简单性的同时，有效解决了其实际挑战，为优化VAE训练提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Motivation: 现有方法难以学习边界复杂物理运动或需要物体先验（如掩码或类型），因此需要一种无需先验的方法。

Method: 提出FreeGave，结合物理编码和发散自由模块，估计每高斯速度场，避免低效的PINN损失。

Result: 在三个公共数据集和新收集的真实数据集上表现优异，尤其在未来帧外推和运动分割任务中。

Conclusion: 物理编码能无监督学习有意义的3D物理运动模式。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging

largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模比较神经元解释质量提供了高效工具，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

Conclusion: MADFormer为未来混合生成模型提供了实用的设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

*Stephanie Fu,Tyler Bonnen,Devin Guillory,Trevor Darrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了视觉语言模型（VLMs）与其视觉编码器的性能，发现VLMs在视觉任务中表现显著较差，接近随机水平。瓶颈在于VLMs未能有效利用视觉信息，且受语言模型先验影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs如何整合视觉与语言信息，以评估其在视觉任务中的表现。

Method: 通过一系列视觉中心基准测试（如深度估计、对应关系），对比VLMs与视觉编码器的性能，并分析失败原因。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于视觉编码器，接近随机水平，主要瓶颈在于未能有效利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源VLMs的失败模式，为未来改进视觉理解提供了评估方法。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

TL;DR: Self Forcing是一种新的自回归视频扩散模型训练方法，通过自生成输出解决曝光偏差问题，实现高效实时视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归视频扩散模型中的曝光偏差问题，即在推理时模型需要基于自身不完美的输出来生成序列。

Method: 在训练时通过自回归展开和KV缓存，基于自生成输出生成帧，并使用视频级损失监督。采用少步扩散模型和随机梯度截断策略提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单GPU上实现亚秒级延迟的实时视频生成，生成质量与更慢的非因果扩散模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: Self Forcing通过自生成输出和高效训练策略，成功解决了曝光偏差问题，实现了高质量实时视频生成。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Motivation: 多任务学习需要大量标注，而部分任务标注的局限性促使研究零样本设置下的多任务学习方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型进行潜在回归，采用任务编码、任务条件化和统一潜在损失，设计多流模型和任务注意力机制。

Result: 在8个基准测试的7个任务上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StableMTL通过扩散模型和任务注意力机制，实现了零样本多任务学习的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is
computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an
efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional
space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various
centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and
demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based
centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding
allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and
scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架为双层进化算法提供了通用高效策略，推动双层优化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统的记忆机制过于简单，忽视了代理间协作的复杂性，且缺乏跨任务和代理特定的定制化，限制了系统的自我进化能力。

Method: 引入G-Memory，一种基于组织记忆理论的分层记忆系统，通过洞察图、查询图和交互图三层次结构，双向检索高层次的通用洞察和细粒度的协作轨迹。

Result: 在五个基准测试、三种LLM骨干和三种流行MAS框架中，G-Memory显著提升了任务成功率和知识问答准确性，分别高达20.89%和10.12%。

Conclusion: G-Memory通过改进记忆架构，显著提升了多代理系统的协作能力和自我进化潜力，且无需修改原有框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在多智能体规划中具有潜力，但其适应能力有限，无法有效应对复杂场景。

Method: 采用LIET范式，结合个体学习（局部效用函数）和团队演化（共享合作知识列表），提升LLM的规划和协作能力。

Result: 在Communicative Watch-And-Help和ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport基准测试中，LIET表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LIET框架通过个体与团队的动态适应，显著提升了LLM在多智能体环境中的规划与协作能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

Conclusion: MedChat为医学影像诊断提供了一种更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Result: 在Surge XT合成器上，该方法在音频重建指标上优于回归和生成基线。

Conclusion: 通过概率分布视角和置换等变方法，有效解决了合成器参数反演问题。

Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter
configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently
ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of
the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we
demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under
permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a
permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then,
viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show
that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance.
Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution,
we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant
continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real
synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively
discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a
full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we
find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio
reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: SASTNet能有效提升源追踪的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech
(CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG)
models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source
tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance
on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show
that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to
non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate
these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network
(SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and
Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

Conclusion: 该方法通过单流设计和多模态协作学习，实现了高效、轻量化的深度伪造检测，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate
electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials.
Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn
attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial
structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses
challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex
metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements
customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many
metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our
method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse
range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers
valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of
the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental
fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form
metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage
applications.

sources.
  Method: We conducted a comprehensive survey of 36 works, analyzing and
categorizing lifecycle-relevant techniques.
  Results: We propose a modular lifecycle model structured into main, optional,
and cross-cutting components. The model captures key interconnections across
stages, supporting method reuse, co-adaptation, and lifecycle-awareness.
  Conclusion: Our framework provides a coherent foundation for developing and
maintaining SLMs, bridging theory and practice, and guiding future research and
tool development.
