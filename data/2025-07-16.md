### [1] [Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender: AI Agents to fact-check YouTube videos and influence opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10577)
*Logé Cécile,Ghori Rehan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI系统，通过Truth Sleuth和Trend Bender两个代理，分别进行视频内容的事实核查和评论区互动，以对抗YouTube上的错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 错误信息在数字世界中快速传播，威胁社会，需要有效工具进行干预。

Method: Truth Sleuth提取视频声明并使用RAG方法验证；Trend Bender生成评论以引导讨论。系统通过自评估循环优化。

Result: 实验显示系统在事实核查和用户互动方面高效，能影响观点。

Conclusion: AI驱动的干预在对抗错误信息和促进在线信息真实性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often
spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel
approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that
not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages
users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system
comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,
Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced
and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender
leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to
generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive
debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to
iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established
benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its
potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings
highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the
potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering
a more informed online space.

### [2] [An Offline Mobile Conversational Agent for Mental Health Support: Learning from Emotional Dialogues and Psychological Texts with Student-Centered Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10580)
*Vimaleswar A,Prabhu Nandan Sahu,Nilesh Kumar Sahu,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoSApp是一款基于智能手机的离线情感支持应用，利用LLMs技术，专为心理健康设计，解决了用户可访问性和数据隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字心理健康平台面临用户可访问性、网络连接和数据隐私等挑战，需要一种离线解决方案。

Method: 通过微调、量化和部署LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct模型，结合自定义心理健康知识数据集，开发了EmoSApp。

Result: 定性评估显示应用能提供连贯、共情的对话和心理健康建议；定量评估验证了模型在低资源环境下的有效性。

Conclusion: EmoSApp为便携、安全和定制化的AI心理健康解决方案提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an
individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to
expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent
challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and
data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based
solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support
App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

### [3] [Transforming Sensitive Documents into Quantitative Data: An AI-Based Preprocessing Toolchain for Structured and Privacy-Conscious Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10582)
*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化工具链，用于处理敏感、异构的非结构化文本数据，支持隐私保护的大规模分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律、医疗和行政领域的非结构化文本是公共卫生和社会科学研究的重要资源，但敏感信息和数据异构性限制了其利用。

Method: 使用开源模型构建工具链，通过LLM提示标准化、总结和翻译文本，结合实体识别和规则方法匿名化。

Result: 在瑞典法院判决数据集上验证，工具链有效匿名化并保留语义内容，支持半自动化内容分析。

Conclusion: 该工具链为隐私敏感领域的大规模文本分析提供了新可能。

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

### [4] [A Taxonomy for Design and Evaluation of Prompt-Based Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10585)
*Isar Nejadgholi,Mona Omidyeganeh,Marc-Antoine Drouin,Jonathan Boisvert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对自然语言解释（NLEs）的更新版XAI分类法，以支持透明AI系统的治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，NLEs成为解释模型行为的关键工具，需要对其特性和治理影响进行深入研究。

Method: 基于可解释AI（XAI）文献，构建了一个适应提示型NLEs的三维分类法，涵盖上下文、生成与呈现、评估。

Result: 分类法为研究者、审计者和政策制定者提供了描述、设计和改进NLEs的框架。

Conclusion: 该分类法有助于提升AI系统的透明度，支持有效的AI治理。

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

### [5] [AutoRAG-LoRA: Hallucination-Triggered Knowledge Retuning via Lightweight Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10586)
*Kaushik Dwivedi,Padmanabh Patanjali Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRAG-LoRA是一个模块化框架，通过轻量级LoRA适配器和KL正则化训练减少大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，影响实际部署的信任度。

Method: 结合自动提示重写、混合检索和低秩适配器调优，通过KL损失和适配器微调实现事实对齐。

Result: 显著减少了事实漂移，同时保持了模型的效率和模块化。

Conclusion: AutoRAG-LoRA有效解决了大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

### [6] [Anthropomimetic Uncertainty: What Verbalized Uncertainty in Language Models is Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10587)
*Dennis Ulmer,Alexandra Lorson,Ivan Titov,Christian Hardmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过语言模型表达不确定性以增强用户信任，提出了模仿人类沟通的“拟人化不确定性”概念，并分析了现有研究的不足与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型输出常过于自信，导致用户对其信任度降低，需通过表达不确定性来改善人机协作。

Method: 综述人类不确定性沟通研究，分析数据偏见，提出拟人化不确定性概念。

Result: 揭示了现有研究中被忽视的偏见，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 拟人化不确定性是提升语言模型信任的关键，需进一步研究其在人机交互中的应用。

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

### [7] [PLEX: Perturbation-free Local Explanations for LLM-Based Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10596)
*Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Misbah Farooq,Varuna De Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLEX是一种无需扰动的局部解释方法，通过利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，显著提高了解释效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本分类中表现优异，但其复杂性导致解释性差，现有XAI方法（如LIME和SHAP）计算成本高。

Method: PLEX利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，无需扰动即可生成解释，显著降低计算负担。

Result: PLEX在四个分类任务中与LIME和SHAP的一致性超过92%，且解释速度提升2-4个数量级。

Conclusion: PLEX为基于LLM的可解释文本分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

### [8] [Emergence of Hierarchical Emotion Organization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10599)
*Bo Zhao,Maya Okawa,Eric J. Bigelow,Rose Yu,Tomer Ullman,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Hidenori Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs自然形成与人类心理模型一致的分层情感树，且模型越大层级越复杂。研究发现情感识别存在社会经济偏见，尤其是对边缘群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何建模用户情感状态，以支持伦理部署。

Method: 基于情感轮理论，分析模型输出中情感状态的概率依赖关系。

Result: LLMs形成分层情感树，与社会经济身份相关的系统性偏见被发现。

Conclusion: LLMs内化了社会感知，认知理论可用于改进模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

### [9] [Language Models for Adult Service Website Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10743)
*Nickolas Freeman,Thanh Nguyen,Gregory Bott,Jason Parton,Collin Francel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了成人服务网站（ASW）广告文本分析在识别性交易受害者中的应用，提出了一种高效的定制Transformer模型，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASW广告文本因使用表情符号、语法混乱和故意混淆而难以分析，但对其进行分析有助于识别性交易受害者。

Method: 研究比较了信息检索方法、预训练Transformer和定制Transformer模型，发现定制模型在有限GPU资源下表现更优。

Result: 定制模型在准确性、召回率、F1分数和ROC AUC上优于BERT-base、RoBERTa和ModernBERT等模型。

Conclusion: 定制Transformer模型为ASW文本分析提供了显著进步，可用于下游应用和研究。

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

*Michal Podstawski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用预训练文本嵌入模型增强属性图的语义分析，提升节点分类和关系预测任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 属性图中丰富的文本属性未被充分利用，通过语义分析可增强图分析任务的效果。

Method: 将预训练语言模型的嵌入技术整合到图分析流程中，不改变图结构。

Result: 语义嵌入显著提升了节点分类和关系预测的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 文本语义能有效增强属性图分析的性能，为下游任务提供更丰富的上下文信息。

Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can
enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of
pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such
graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream
tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved
contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings
into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that
textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability
of property graph analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MISS-QA是首个评估模型解释科学文献中示意图能力的基准，包含1,500个专家标注示例。测试了18种前沿多模态模型，发现与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献中的示意图是重要信息来源，但现有模型对其理解能力不足，需要专门评估。

Method: 构建MISS-QA基准，包含465篇科学论文的示意图和问题，测试18种多模态模型。

Result: 模型表现显著低于人类专家，尤其在无法回答的问题上。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态科学文献理解上仍有局限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within
scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over
465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting
schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering
corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the
paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models,
including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant
performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis
of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis
further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key
insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.

### [12] [Testing Hypotheses from the Social Approval Theory of Online Hate: An Analysis of 110 Million Posts from Parler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10810)
*David M. Markowitz,Samuel Hardman Taylor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交平台上的仇恨言论并不因获得社交认可（如点赞）而增加或变得更极端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交认可是否如Walter的理论所述，会激励更多仇恨言论及其极端化。

Method: 分析Parler平台上1.1亿条帖子（2018-2021），研究点赞数与后续仇恨言论的关系。

Result: 点赞数与后续仇恨言论无显著关联，甚至在某些时间间隔呈负相关。

Conclusion: 社交认可对仇恨言论的强化机制在特定平台可能表现不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

### [13] [LLMs on Trial: Evaluating Judicial Fairness for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10852)
*Yiran Hu,Zongyue Xue,Haitao Li,Siyuan Zheng,Qingjing Chen,Shaochun Wang,Xihan Zhang,Ning Zheng,Yun Liu,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu,Charles L. A. Clarke,Weixing Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）司法公平性的框架，发现LLM在司法决策中存在普遍的不一致性、偏见和不平衡的准确性，尤其是在人口统计标签上表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在司法领域中的公平性及其对社会正义的影响，确保其作为法官时的可信度。

Method: 基于司法公平理论构建框架，开发三个评估指标（不一致性、偏见、不平衡准确性），并在177,100个案例数据集（JudiFair）上测试16种LLM。

Result: 发现LLM普遍存在不公平问题，调整温度参数可改善公平性，但模型规模、发布时间和来源国无显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在司法领域的公平性挑战，并提供了公开工具包以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

*Ikumi Numaya,Shoji Moriya,Shiki Sato,Reina Akama,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了对话生成中用户主观风格相似性与客观风格相似性的区别，发现主观相似性与用户偏好强相关，且与客观评价不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户与系统风格相似性对用户印象的影响，区分主观与客观相似性。

Method: 构建包含用户偏好、主观风格相似性和客观风格相似性的新数据集，并进行分析。

Result: 主观风格相似性与用户偏好呈强正相关，且与客观评价存在差异。

Conclusion: 需区分主观与客观评价，以更好地理解风格相似性与用户偏好的关系。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

Result: 编码器在分类和检索任务中表现更好，解码器在生成任务中更优，相互转换效果较差。

Conclusion: 编码器和解码器架构各有优势，直接转换效果不佳，开源了所有研究数据以支持未来工作。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

### [16] [HanjaBridge: Resolving Semantic Ambiguity in Korean LLMs via Hanja-Augmented Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10920)
*Seungho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HanjaBridge方法，通过注入汉字的语义信息解决韩语中的同音异义问题，显著提升低资源语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 韩语等低资源语言在大型语言模型中表现不佳，部分原因是同音异义汉字词在韩文脚本中无法区分。

Method: 提出HanjaBridge，在持续预训练框架中引入多候选汉字映射和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在KoBALT基准上相对提升21%，并观察到跨语言正迁移。

Conclusion: HanjaBridge有效提升韩语理解能力，且无需推理时额外成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

Motivation: 了解LLMs在类比推理任务中是否接近人类表现，以及如何通过语义表示和提示改进其推理能力。

Method: 通过故事类比任务，评估LLMs的语义表示和显式提示效果，比较不同模型规模和架构（如GPT-4和LLaMA3）的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在类比推理中能捕捉相似性但缺乏人类般的稳健推理，模型规模和架构对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在类比推理中显示出潜力，但仍需改进以更接近人类推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在AI任务中表现优异，但在手语生成领域应用有限，因其复杂性和独特规则。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过微调LLM，采用逐步提示策略提取其内在手语知识，支持手语学习和生成。

Result: 在How2Sign和Phoenix14T数据集上验证，TEAM-Sign能有效对齐手语与口语的分布和语法规则。

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign成功利用LLM能力，为手语生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

Motivation: 解决文本性别歧视检测任务中的多语言和多任务挑战，同时减少计算和存储开销。

Method: 采用层次化LoRA适配器，对Llama 3.1 8B的所有线性变换进行参数高效微调，并通过多语言统一训练实现跨语言迁移。

Result: 在三个子任务中表现优异（F1分数：0.6774、0.4991、0.6519），训练时间和存储需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言性别歧视检测中高效且性能优越，适合实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻推荐系统可能加剧信息茧房和政治极化，需要立场检测技术来促进观点多样性。现有研究局限于短文本和高资源语言。

Method: 提出K-News-Stance数据集和JoA-ICL框架，利用语言模型代理预测关键段落立场并聚合为文章级立场。

Result: JoA-ICL优于现有方法，分段代理机制有效捕捉长新闻立场。案例研究显示其在推荐多样性和媒体偏见分析中的潜力。

Conclusion: K-News-Stance和JoA-ICL填补了立场检测在长文本和低资源语言的空白，有助于新闻多样性和偏见分析。

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM在临床决策支持系统中的潜力，能够提升早期预警系统并将患者叙述转化为可操作的风险评估。

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

Motivation: 跨境金融活动增多，需要准确识别和分类外国实体以支持风险管理、合规和防止金融不当行为。传统匹配方法因语言变化和语义问题效果不佳。

Method: 比较了传统方法（如Jaccard、余弦、Levenshtein距离）、Hugging Face的LLMs和接口型LLMs（如Microsoft Copilot、Qwen 2.5），使用65个葡萄牙公司案例数据集。

Result: 传统方法准确率超92%，但误报率高（20-40%）；接口型LLMs准确率超93%，F1分数超96%，误报率更低（40-80%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在实体匹配任务中优于传统方法，尤其在处理语言和语义复杂性时表现更佳。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs的安全隐患，呼吁重新设计对齐机制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs更广泛和持久的漏洞，并提出了一种实用的防御方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which
handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered
few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%
for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight
OCR-VLM ensembles, when paired with precise prompt strategies and cross-lingual
augmentation, can outperform heavier end-to-end models in high-stakes,

Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLMs在GDPR合规性（尤其是“被遗忘权”）方面的隐私问题，现有方法无法有效识别模型中存储的个人数据。

Method: 方法包括引入WikiMem数据集和一种模型无关的度量标准，通过校准负对数似然对真实值与反事实进行排名。

Conclusion: 研究为动态构建遗忘集提供了基础，支持机器遗忘和被遗忘权请求的实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多代理系统（MAS）在定性研究中的表现，发现温度和代理角色对共识构建和编码准确性有显著影响，但MAS并未普遍优于单代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多代理系统（MAS）在定性研究中的潜力，尤其是其在编码和数据标注方面的表现，以验证其是否优于单代理系统。

Method: 通过实验研究，使用6种开源LLM和18种配置，分析了77,000多个编码决策，比较了MAS和单代理的表现。

Result: 温度和代理角色显著影响共识构建，但MAS在编码准确性上并未普遍优于单代理。仅特定模型和条件下MAS表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在定性研究中的局限性，挑战了多样MAS角色能带来更好结果的观念，并开源了实验代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的偏见评测数据集EsBBQ和CaBBQ，用于评估大型语言模型在西班牙社会背景下的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源主要针对英语和美国社会背景，缺乏其他语言和社会背景的偏见评估工具。

Method: 基于BBQ数据集，设计了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的平行数据集，采用多选题QA形式评估10类社会偏见。

Result: 模型在模糊场景中倾向于选择错误答案，高QA准确率常与更强的偏见依赖相关。

Conclusion: EsBBQ和CaBBQ填补了非英语社会偏见评估的空白，揭示了模型在非英语环境中的偏见问题。

Abstract: Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)
perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable
lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English,
and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the
Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and
CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to
assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

Motivation: 现有FSM提取技术在可扩展性、覆盖范围和自然语言规范模糊性方面存在不足，FlowFSM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FlowFSM结合LLM、提示链和思维链推理，系统处理协议规范，识别状态转换并构建结构化规则书。

Result: 在FTP和RTSP协议上的实验表明，FlowFSM提取精度高，且减少了虚假转换。

Conclusion: FlowFSM展示了基于代理的LLM系统在协议分析和FSM推断中的潜力，适用于网络安全和逆向工程。

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs的多语言机制具有挑战性，现有研究多关注单个神经元，但多义性使得难以从跨语言表示中分离语言特定单元。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）学习单义特征，并引入SAE-LAPE方法，基于特征激活概率识别语言特定特征。

Result: 发现语言特定特征主要分布在模型中间到最终层，影响模型的多语言性能和语言输出，可用于语言识别，性能与fastText相当且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE方法成功识别了语言特定特征，为理解LLMs的多语言机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder架构的KV Cache在推理过程中逐渐增加，成为内存和带宽效率的瓶颈。

Method: 提出KV-Latent范式，降采样Key-Value向量至潜在空间，并改进Rotary Positional Embedding的频率采样机制。

Result: 实验显示KV-Latent能显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: KV-Latent为高效语言模型系统提供了新可能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale

formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$

making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为中文仇恨言论检测的可解释性研究提供了重要资源和改进方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it
delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新颖性评估方法（专家判断或引用组合）存在局限性，如专家知识有限和引用组合效果不确定。LLM拥有丰富知识，但缺乏人类专家的判断能力，因此结合两者可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 从同行评审报告中提取新颖性相关句子，利用LLM总结论文方法部分，用于微调PLMs（如BERT），并设计稀疏注意力模块融合人类和LLM知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在评估方法新颖性方面优于大量基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合人类专家和LLM的知识可以有效提升学术论文新颖性评估的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 由于现有的PMRs在结构、复杂性和可用性上差异较大，且缺乏系统比较，同时PMG方法的评估策略和技术各异，难以直接对比。

Method: 研究引入了PMo数据集，包含55个过程描述及对应的九种PMRs模型，并从两个维度评估PMRs：LLM-based PMo的适用性和PMG性能。

Result: Mermaid在六项PMo标准中得分最高，而BPMN text在过程元素相似性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为PMRs的选择提供了实证依据，Mermaid和BPMN text在不同场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a simple weighted loss function to
Transformer-based models for multi-label emotion detection in SemEval-2025
Shared Task 11. Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting

without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate
BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such
as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients.
The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on
high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes.
These findings underscore both the effectiveness and the challenges of applying
this approach to imbalanced multi-label emotion detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对基准数据污染的担忧，即模型可能无意中记忆评估数据，导致性能指标虚高，影响对模型真实泛化能力的评估。

Method: DCR框架通过四个粒度级别（语义、信息、数据和标签）检测和量化污染，并使用模糊推理系统合成污染分数，生成统一的DCR因子来调整原始准确率。

Result: 在9个LLMs（0.5B-72B）上验证，DCR框架能可靠诊断污染严重程度，调整后的准确率与未污染基准相比平均误差在4%以内。

Conclusion: DCR框架计算高效且透明，为日常评估提供了实用的污染检测工具，有助于更公平的比较和提升LLM基准测试的可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何通过提示控制大语言模型（LLMs）的推理策略，并评估其对逻辑问题解决的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLMs倾向于单一推理策略，可能限制其在多样化推理任务中的表现。

Method: 通过实验评估不同提示策略对LLMs推理能力的影响，并提出方法引导模型选择最优策略。

Result: 实验显示单一策略无法持续提升准确性，但若能自适应选择最优策略，性能可提升。

Conclusion: 提出引导LLMs策略选择的新方法，为优化其推理能力提供新思路。

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific
problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a
single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical
problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy
consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: HKGAI-V1是一个为香港定制的多语言大语言模型，通过深度调整和检索增强生成技术，解决了本地文化、法律和价值观问题，并在敏感查询和数字主权方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为香港建立符合本地文化、法律和价值观的AI基础设施，解决多语言环境和独特社会法律背景的挑战。

Method: 基于DeepSeek架构，通过全参数微调和检索增强生成（RAG）系统，开发了HKGAI-V1模型，并设计了专有的对抗性香港价值观基准。

Result: HKGAI-V1在处理香港特定敏感查询上优于通用模型，并实现了数字主权；开发了评估模型本地伦理和法律对齐的工具。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个可复制的框架，用于开发符合本地身份的高级区域化AI系统。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems"
framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful
development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in
handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a
"governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to
exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public
services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary
Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment
with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By
documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological
artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally
focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.

Motivation: 探讨在酒店亮点总结任务中，如何评估生成内容对输入数据的忠实性，比较不同评估方法的有效性。

Method: 通过人类评估活动（分类错误评估和片段级标注），比较传统指标、可训练方法和LLM作为评估者的表现。

Result: 简单指标（如词重叠）与人类判断相关性高，LLM评估不可靠，易出现标注偏差。商业影响分析显示错误信息风险最大。

Conclusion: 简单指标在跨域数据中表现优异，LLM评估不可靠，需注意众包评估的挑战和错误信息的风险。

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

TL;DR: SAMEP是一种新型框架，通过持久、安全且可语义搜索的内存共享协议，解决了AI代理间协作和知识共享的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理架构存在短暂内存限制，阻碍了跨会话和代理边界的有效协作与知识共享。

Method: SAMEP采用分布式内存存储库，结合向量语义搜索、加密访问控制和标准化API，支持持久上下文保存、安全多代理协作和高效语义发现。

Result: 实验显示，SAMEP减少了73%的冗余计算，提高了89%的上下文相关性得分，并完全符合法规要求。

Conclusion: SAMEP为持久、协作的AI代理生态系统提供了安全性和隐私保障的新范式。

Abstract: Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations,
preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and
agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a
novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable
memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical
challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2)
secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3)
efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a
distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic
access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing
agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness
across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare
AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental
results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in
context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements
including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent,
collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy
guarantees.

*Hung Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究质疑传统多智能体强化学习（MARL）中人为引入的归纳偏置是否过度设计，提出基于VQ-VAE的“AI母语”（AIM）框架，证明智能体内生符号系统可实现自发语义压缩与纳什均衡驱动的语义收敛，无需外部偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MARL中的“联合探索困境”导致智能体陷入“通信真空均衡”，研究旨在探索是否可通过内生符号系统自然实现有效通信。

Method: 采用基于VQ-VAE的AIM框架，分析智能体的神经表征与符号使用行为。

Result: AIM框架无需外部偏置即可实现高效符号通信，符号使用呈现幂律分布，并提出了三项理论见解。

Conclusion: 内生符号系统为MARL提供新思路，未来将探索HQ-VAE增强表达能力及RL低层预训练的潜力。

Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development
of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration
Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' .
Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate
communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such
artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments
with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized
Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an
endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit
spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic
convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external
inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that
the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and
resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM
demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis
toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a
significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical
insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First
Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research
will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders
(HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the
potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This
discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

Motivation: 解决多智能体AI在零样本设置下的可信度问题，特别是在视觉和语言理解结合的领域。

Method: 引入了三种配置：零样本置信度协调、微调智能体和基于CLIP的信任校准协调。使用置信度校准指标（ECE、OCR、CCC）调节智能体间的信任。

Result: 零样本设置下准确率提升77.94%，总体达到85.63%。GPT-4o表现更好的校准性，而Qwen-2.5-VL表现出过度自信。

Conclusion: 该系统通过分离感知和元推理，实现了可扩展和可解释的多智能体AI，适用于诊断、生物学等信任关键领域。所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent
architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing
challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot
settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual
classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a
non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three
configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)
fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated
orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.
Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator
modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy
improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,
achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL
displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with
visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via
iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision
agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable
multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other
trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components
including the complete software source code are openly released to support
reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github:

*Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在符号推理、算术准确性和逻辑一致性任务中的系统性失败，提出了一种称为“计算分裂脑综合征”的现象，即模型能表达正确原则但无法可靠应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在复杂任务中表现不佳的根本原因，揭示其理解与能力之间的鸿沟。

Method: 通过控制实验和架构分析，验证LLMs在原则表达与应用上的不一致性。

Result: 发现LLMs缺乏结构化推理的架构支持，行为脆弱，且指令与执行路径在几何和功能上分离。

Conclusion: 未来模型需引入元认知控制、原则提升和结构化执行，以克服当前LLMs的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet
systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy,
and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such
failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and
\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,
we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably
applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational
execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain
syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and
functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from
mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model
behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs
function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural
scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the
boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with
metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.
This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may
reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal
computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction
and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and
mechanistic analysis.

TL;DR: KG2data结合知识图谱、LLMs和工具使用技术，提升气象领域数据查询的准确性和智能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在知识密集型领域（如气象学）中通过API调用使用工具的能力尚未充分探索，限制了复杂查询的性能。

Method: KG2data整合知识图谱、LLMs、ReAct代理和工具技术，通过虚拟API评估API调用的准确性。

Result: KG2data在名称识别失败、幻觉失败和调用正确性上表现优于RAG2data和chat2data。

Conclusion: KG2data为高知识需求领域提供了智能、基于知识的问答和数据分析解决方案。

Abstract: API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for
data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API
calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology.
This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs,
ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition
and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we
evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure,
hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior
performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and
chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based
systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which
hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a
knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval,
complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship
resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost
of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain
knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for
intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains
with high knowledge demands.

Motivation: 研究WoA的动机是为了整合分散在不同社区的研究，揭示现代系统与早期标准之间的连续性，从而促进对该领域发展的整体理解。

Method: 通过引入四轴分类法（语义基础、通信范式、智能中心、发现机制），系统化地比较不同世代的代理架构。

Result: 分析表明，现代协议是早期标准的直接进化响应，并揭示了智能中心从外部数据或平台转向代理核心模型的范式转变。

Conclusion: 论文指出，新协议虽重要，但不足以构建一个稳健、开放、可信的生态系统，未来的研究应聚焦于解决去中心化身份、经济模型、安全和治理等社会技术挑战。

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,
document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'
behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become
more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across
different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered
frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation
obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic
understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive
evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and
the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations
of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To
systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic
foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery
mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing
agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent
where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift
in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic
Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model
(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable
and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new
protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,
trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies
in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda
focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance
for the emerging WoA.

Motivation: 探索如何通过变异曲调的语法结构生成新曲调，并研究变异对曲调变化的影响。

Method: 使用Sequitur算法解析曲调的Pathway Assembly（PA），生成语法结构，然后随机应用19种变异类型（如添加、删除、交换或反转部分语法）对语法进行变异，最后扩展语法生成新曲调。

Result: 通过编辑距离、结构复杂度和曲调长度等指标分析变异对曲调的影响，并评估每种变异类型的效果大小。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成与原曲调相关的新曲调，并通过变异逐步改变曲调特性，但仅关注音高序列生成。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by
varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [
1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur
algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out
mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially
19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of
the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the
mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar.
Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune.
The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original
tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple
mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are
used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the
size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review
the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only
focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish
traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each
tune's pitch values.

Conclusion: AI初期可能对环境造成压力，但长期将成为气候缓解的重要工具。

Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources,
and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked
significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with
the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and
AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy
consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering
both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and
beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net
positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,
we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive
workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and
consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely
strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and
therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of
big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and
complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and
applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more
promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its
ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from
energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon
footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial
emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where
traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some
initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support
climate mitigation efforts.

Motivation: 物联网系统的流量模式具有时序性和多样性，为模型学习提供了丰富的数据，因此需要高效的检测方法。

Method: 采用了GraphSAGE、BERT、TCN、Multi-Head Attention、BI-LSTM和LSTM等模型进行实验。

Result: BERT表现最优，准确率达99.94%，其他指标也接近完美；Multi-Head Attention结果可解释但耗时；GraphSAGE训练快但性能较低。

Conclusion: BERT在捕获时序依赖方面表现卓越，适合物联网恶意攻击检测；其他模型各有优劣，需根据需求选择。

Abstract: This paper intends to detect IoT malicious attacks through deep learning
models and demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning and
graph-based models regarding malicious network traffic detection. The models
particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head
Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM)
Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models
demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature
significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT
system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of
temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that
BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate
alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which
demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The
Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection
capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head
Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The
GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training
time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the
other models

Abstract: Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important
as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical
diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans,
especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel
at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process
large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting
help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in
this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes,
such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data
that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can
effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so,
we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along
with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the
exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other
abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three
classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN
architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing
performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial
quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic

evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic

16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based
approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for
qualitative research. Keywords: thematic analysis, large language models,

TL;DR: SigmaScheduling动态调整决策点时间，提高移动健康干预的及时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定间隔的决策点调度对习惯性行为干预效果不佳，尤其是对作息不规律的用户。

Method: 提出SigmaScheduling方法，根据行为时间预测的不确定性动态调整决策点。

Result: 在68名参与者的试验中，SigmaScheduling在70%以上的情况下确保决策点早于目标行为。

Conclusion: SigmaScheduling能提升移动健康干预的精准性，适用于时间敏感的习惯性行为。

Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health
(mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points,"
intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions
(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey
data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting
habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on
delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.
Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)
before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same
for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly
for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after
the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.
In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule
decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior
timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to
the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling
schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely
intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68
participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily
toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points
preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to
intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can
advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive,
habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AF-XRAY是一个开源工具包，用于探索、分析和可视化法律推理中的抽象论证框架（AFs），帮助非专家识别歧义来源并解释论证接受性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律推理中的论证框架存在歧义和解释困难，非专家难以理解。AF-XRAY旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AF-XRAY提供分层可视化、攻击边分类、替代解决方案叠加和关键攻击集识别等功能。

Result: AF-XRAY能将歧义场景转化为明确的解决方案，帮助用户定位歧义原因并探索替代方案。

Conclusion: AF-XRAY通过实际案例验证，支持目的论法律推理，展示不同假设如何导致不同结论。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning,
but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains
challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for
exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY
introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length
revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack
edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay
visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded
semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension
resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack
sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling
users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative
resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by
Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by
revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

*Zongtao He,Liuyi Wang,Lu Chen,Chengju Liu,Qijun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NavComposer是一个自动生成高质量导航指令的框架，通过分解和重组语义实体（如动作、场景和对象）来生成自然语言指令。NavInstrCritic是一个无需标注的评估系统，从三个维度评估指令质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专家提供的导航指令数量有限，而合成指令质量不足的问题，以支持大规模研究。

Method: NavComposer分解语义实体并重组为指令；NavInstrCritic从对比匹配、语义一致性和语言多样性三个维度评估指令。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，支持更可扩展和通用的研究。

Conclusion: NavComposer和NavInstrCritic为语言导航提供了高质量指令生成和评估的解决方案。

Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents
to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However,
expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

*Yicong Wu,Ting Chen,Irit Hochberg,Zhoujian Sun,Ruth Edry,Zhengxing Huang,Mor Peleg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统（MAS）在慢性多病症患者治疗推荐中的可行性和价值，模拟多学科团队（MDT）决策，结果显示单智能体GP表现与MDT相当，但建议存在不完整和药物冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性多病症患者的治疗推荐因治疗冲突风险而复杂化，现有决策支持系统存在可扩展性限制，研究旨在探索LLM-MAS系统的潜力。

Method: 设计了单智能体和MAS框架，模拟MDT决策过程，通过LLM智能体间的讨论解决医疗冲突，并在多病症患者治疗任务中评估性能。

Result: 当前LLM下单智能体GP表现与MDT相当，部分模型能提供满足临床目标的正确建议，但存在建议不完整和药物冲突问题。

Conclusion: LLM-MAS系统在多病症治疗推荐中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以减少建议不完整和药物冲突。

Abstract: Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is
challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support
systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general
practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening
multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the
feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent
system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and
a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM
agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy
planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared
MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An
important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics
that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of
clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold
standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP
performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct
recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are
incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in
unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型在序列生成中表现出强大能力，但也可能生成有害序列（如增强病毒传播性或逃避免疫反应的蛋白质），带来生物安全和伦理挑战。

Method: 提出KPO框架，结合蛋白质安全知识图谱，采用图剪枝策略识别偏好序列，并利用强化学习降低有害序列生成风险。

Result: 实验表明，KPO能有效减少有害序列生成，同时保持高功能性。

Conclusion: KPO为生物技术中生成模型的应用提供了可靠的安全保障框架。

Abstract: Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence
generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and
denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of
generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral
transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical
biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior
knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an
efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs
reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins.
Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of
producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a
robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in
biotechnology.

Result: 模型预测鸟类分布的准确率为85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且可靠的鸟类迁徙预测方法。

Abstract: Due to climate-induced changes, many habitats are experiencing range shifts
away from their traditional geographic locations (Piguet, 2011). We propose a
solution to accurately model whether bird species are present in a specific
habitat through the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
(O'Shea, 2015) and tabular data. Our approach makes use of satellite imagery
and environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, elevation) to
predict bird presence across various climates. The CNN model captures spatial
characteristics of landscapes such as forestation, water bodies, and
urbanization, whereas the tabular method uses ecological and geographic data.
Both systems predict the distribution of birds with an average accuracy of 85%,
offering a scalable but reliable method to understand bird migration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有练习推荐方法通常忽视问题的语义内容和学习的顺序性，ExRec旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ExRec采用端到端流程，包括问题知识组件标注、语义表示学习、知识追踪模型训练和强化学习方法优化，并改进了基于Q学习的强化学习方法。

Result: 在四个真实数学学习任务中验证了ExRec的有效性，展示了其对未见问题的泛化能力和可解释的学习轨迹。

Conclusion: ExRec展示了知识追踪引导的强化学习在教育个性化中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise
recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds
on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate
student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key
aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential,
structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents
an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their
semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard
Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value
estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in
estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of
our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different
educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec
generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces
interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight
the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.

Motivation: 传统手工规则方法在复杂战场环境中表现脆弱，而现有强化学习方法缺乏可解释性且主要关注动作而非战略决策。

Method: 整合视觉语言模型用于场景理解和轻量级大语言模型用于战略推理，在共享语义空间中实现统一感知与决策。

Result: 仿真与消融实验表明，该方法相比基线模型胜率超过80%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟人类指挥官的认知过程，实现了高适应性和可解释性的全链感知到决策推理。

Abstract: In multiple unmanned ground vehicle confrontations, autonomously evolving
multi-agent tactical decisions from situational awareness remain a significant
challenge. Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the
complicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement
learning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic
decisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language
model-based commander to address the issue of intelligent
perception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method
integrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight
large language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and
decision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and
interpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods,
the combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting
the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation and ablation experiments
validate that the proposed approach achieves a win rate of over 80% compared
with baseline models.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在代码翻译任务中取得进展，但确保翻译代码的正确性和可读性仍是挑战，限制了其在实际软件开发中的应用。

Method: F2STrans包含功能学习（优化翻译正确性）和风格学习（提升可读性），并引入新的代码翻译基准。

Result: 实验表明，F2STrans显著提升性能，使Qwen-1.5B在20种场景中平均优于Qwen-32B和GPT-4。

Conclusion: F2STrans通过分阶段优化，有效解决了代码翻译中的正确性和可读性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code
translation tasks. However, ensuring both the correctness and readability of
translated code remains a challenge, limiting their effective adoption in
real-world software development. In this work, we propose F2STrans, a
function-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the
performance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages:
(1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using
high-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms,
and (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating
both positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel
code translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test
cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive
functional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and
existing datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code
translation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform
prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code
translation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决实物资产（如黄金）在区块链上交易的合规性、流动性和风险管理问题。

Method: 采用链上智能合约控制关键风险，链下AI代理（合规、代币发行、做市、风险控制）协同工作。

Conclusion: AI代理驱动的去中心化交易所可满足高性能和安全需求，为传统非流动性资产提供民主化访问。

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires
bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict
requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present
GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized
AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold
into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart
contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision
making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the
flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents
(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a
coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled
pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token
issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The
Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5
percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:
an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a
simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user
impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000
concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based
decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance
and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing
access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model --
multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters
-- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system
integrity.

neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a
logical and a belief function. We show that our neurosymbolic AI definition
makes abstraction of key representative neurosymbolic AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous systems are becoming an integral part of many application domains,
like in the mobility sector. However, ensuring their safe and correct behaviour
in dynamic and complex environments remains a significant challenge, where
systems should autonomously make decisions e.g., about manoeuvring. We propose
in this paper a general collaborative approach for increasing the level of
trustworthiness in the environment of operation and improve reliability and
good decision making in autonomous system. In the presence of conflicting
information, aggregation becomes a major issue for trustworthy decision making
based on collaborative data sharing. Unlike classical approaches in the
literature that rely on consensus or majority as aggregation rule, we exploit
the fact that autonomous systems have different quality attributes like
perception quality. We use this criteria to determine which autonomous systems
are trustworthy and borrow concepts from social epistemology to define
aggregation and propagation rules, used for automated decision making. We use
Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as formal models for beliefs aggregation and
propagation, and formulate reduction rules to reduce the size of the BDDs and
allow efficient computation structures for collaborative automated reasoning.

Motivation: 传统静态时序分析虽然计算速度快，但只能提供最大延迟的上界，可能导致处理器性能未被充分利用。

Method: 将问题建模为答案集编程（ASP），并提出非平凡的编码方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，ASP能有效解决硬件设计中的复杂问题。

Conclusion: ASP是解决硬件设计中复杂延迟计算问题的可行方案。

Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum
delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is
crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an
Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to
perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,
synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum
clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static
Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can
be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead
to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In
this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum
delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally
hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring
extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem
into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address
complex problems in hardware design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱推理方法因全局和局部信息堆叠导致分数过平滑，模糊了正确与错误答案的区分，影响推理效果。

Method: DuetGraph采用双路径机制（消息传递处理局部信息，注意力机制处理全局信息），并引入粗到细优化策略，将实体分为高、低分集以缩小候选空间。

Result: 实验表明，DuetGraph在推理质量上提升8.7%，训练效率加速1.8倍，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DuetGraph通过分离全局-局部信息处理和粗到细优化，有效解决过平滑问题，显著提升知识图谱推理性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across
various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and
local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods
often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between
correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address
this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with
dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by
segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message
passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,
preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.
In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which
partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the
candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which
alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a
1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

Conclusion: AgentOps通过自动化手段驯服不确定性，为智能代理系统的操作提供了全面支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic
systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex,
adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling
powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of
uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and
fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations
practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing,
analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We
identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site
reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the
system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation
Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric
collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations,
and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of
automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not
by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and
effective operation.

Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables
LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query
complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent
query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to
Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow
similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention
Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to
LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable
LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow
Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the
proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to
direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention
Elicitation.

*Xiang Yin,Nico Potyka,Antonio Rago,Timotheus Kampik,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何使用边加权定量双极论证框架（EW-QBAFs）实现可争议AI决策，提出梯度关系归因解释（G-RAEs）和迭代算法调整边权重以达到目标论证强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI决策与人类偏好一致，但目前EW-QBAFs在此领域的应用较少。

Method: 引入可争议性问题，提出G-RAEs量化边权重对论证强度的影响，并开发迭代算法调整权重。

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟推荐系统和多层感知器的EW-QBAFs中有效解决问题。

Conclusion: EW-QBAFs结合G-RAEs和迭代算法能有效支持AI决策的可争议性。

Abstract: Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human
preferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support
contestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks
(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs
can be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability
problem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)
to achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a
topic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation
attribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic
argument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing
interpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building
on G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the
edge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach
experimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural
characteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer
perceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.

TL;DR: CogDDN是一种基于VLM的框架，通过模拟人类认知和学习机制，结合快速和慢速思维系统，提升机器人在未知环境中的导航和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动的需求导航方法依赖预收集数据，泛化能力有限，无法适应未知场景。

Method: CogDDN通过语义对齐检测对象与指令，结合启发式和分析式决策模块，利用CoT推理优化决策过程。

Result: 在AI2Thor模拟器和ProcThor数据集上的评估显示，CogDDN比单视图相机方法性能提升15%。

Conclusion: CogDDN显著提高了导航准确性和适应性，适用于未知和非结构化环境。

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within
unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven
navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on
implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,
traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model
training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in
unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that
emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and
slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to
fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by
semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.
Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising
a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that
analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously
improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the
decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor
simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view
camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in
navigation accuracy and adaptability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种神经符号框架，结合自然语言对话的可访问性和目标解释的可验证保证，用于复杂物流决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流操作者常面临关键决策，现有方法（如整数规划）速度慢且假设理想环境，而大型语言模型（LLMs）易产生误解和幻觉。

Method: 引入神经符号框架，将用户请求转换为结构化规划规范，量化不确定性，并在置信度低时启动交互式澄清循环。

Result: 轻量级模型在100个不确定性过滤示例上微调，超越GPT-4.1的零样本性能，推理延迟降低近50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂物流提供了一条实用路径，实现可验证、实时且用户对齐的决策。

Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead
of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical
decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous
replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics
plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume
an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for
uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle
uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to
entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they
remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety
and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility
of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.
It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies
its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive
clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A
lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,
surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency
by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward
certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的代码LLMs在分析代码的结构化属性（如控制流和数据流）方面能力有限，而结构化建模方法又缺乏现代LLMs的生成能力和规模。

Method: 结合代码文本建模与结构化建模的优势，提出了一种新方法。

Result: 未明确提及具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 新方法旨在弥补现有技术的不足，提升代码LLMs在结构化分析和生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Code LLMs have become extremely popular recently for modeling source code
across a variety of tasks, such as generation, translation, and summarization.
However, transformer-based models are limited in their capabilities to reason
through structured, analytical properties of code, such as control and data
flow. Previous work has explored the modeling of these properties with
structured data and graph neural networks. However, these approaches lack the
generative capabilities and scale of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach to combine the strengths of modeling both code as text and more
structured forms.

Conclusion: 建议进一步研究CoT的可监控性，并呼吁前沿模型开发者考虑开发决策对CoT监控的影响。

Abstract: AI systems that "think" in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI
safety: we can monitor their chains of thought (CoT) for the intent to
misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is
imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows
promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and
investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT
monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers

Abstract: AI-enhanced Extended Reality (XR) aims to deliver adaptive, immersive

linking dynamic user states with immersive environments. We present PAiR's
architecture, detailing its modules and system flow, and demonstrate its
utility through two proof-of-concept scenarios implemented in the Unity-based
OpenDome engine. PAiR opens a new direction for human-AI interaction by
embedding perspective-based identity models into immersive systems.

Conclusion: 进化范式虽不能完全解决代理问题，但为理解生物系统中的强化学习提供了新方向，建议结合起源生命理论进一步研究。

Abstract: Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition
of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward
hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with
major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired
by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three "dogmas." We
revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To
make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first
establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains
over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational
processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary
insights to enrich the "adaptation-rather-than-search" view of learning. We
then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,
using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.
multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration
in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence
of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the
evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it
gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from
origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication
offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained
reinforcement learning in biological systems.

Method: 引入IFScale基准测试，包含500条关键词包含指令，评估20个前沿模型在高密度指令下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于设计现实应用中的高密度指令提示，并揭示了性能与延迟的权衡。

Abstract: Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even
hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following
capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been
characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a
single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500
keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure
how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density
increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers
and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the
max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning
capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias
towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following
errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in
real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs.
We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at

Motivation: 大规模语料库中文档关系的理解对知识发现和信息组织至关重要，但现有方法依赖人工标注或预定义分类法。

Method: 提出EDR-MQ框架，基于查询边际化估计文档对的联合概率，并开发MC-RAG实现条件检索。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能识别有意义的文档关系，如主题聚类、证据链和跨领域连接。

Conclusion: EDR-MQ提供了一种适应不同用户视角和信息需求的文档组织方法。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between documents in large-scale corpora is
essential for knowledge discovery and information organization. However,
existing approaches rely heavily on manual annotation or predefined
relationship taxonomies. We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by
Marginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document
relationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight
that strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user
queries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by
marginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query
marginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent
document retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing
co-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint
probabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or
predefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization
approach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing
topical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not
apparent through traditional similarity-based methods. Our query-driven
framework offers a practical approach to document organization that adapts to
different user perspectives and information needs.

Result: 大规模预训练的深度神经排序模型表现优于传统方法，但密集检索方法的竞争力下降。

Conclusion: 今年的数据集质量更高，深度学习方法仍占优，但密集检索方法的优势减弱。

Abstract: This is the fourth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous
years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of
human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and
document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$
times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times
increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we
mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage
retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document
ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were
inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to
previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our
judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of
this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish
between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in
overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs
that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they
were last year.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式假设，无法准确捕捉用户的多兴趣，而LLM虽具潜力，但存在兴趣粒度不确定和个体分析数据稀疏的挑战。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能更有效地建模用户多兴趣，提升推荐效果。

Abstract: Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests
based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often
rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same
interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with
real-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant
potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and
powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the
granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to
overly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis
provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we
propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more
effective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to
flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,
indicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic
generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'
collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,
allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's
behaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived
from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose
aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more
comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering
problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'
behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven
multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.
Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 高海拔疾病的分子机制尚不明确，需系统性分析以揭示潜在生物标志物。

Method: 结合监督机器学习和多尺度拉普拉斯图核，从7,847篇PubMed摘要中提取生物分子事件，构建网络并用PageRank算法分析。

Result: 识别出EPO、VEGF等关键蛋白，发现缺氧反应、炎症和应激适应三大功能集群。

Conclusion: 大规模文本挖掘与图分析可揭示HAD机制，为生物标志物研究提供新方向。

Abstract: High-altitude diseases (HAD), encompassing acute mountain sickness (AMS),
high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE),
are triggered by hypobaric hypoxia at elevations above 2,500 meters. These
conditions pose significant health risks, yet the molecular mechanisms remain
insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a biomolecular event
extraction pipeline integrating supervised machine learning with feature-based
and multiscale Laplacian graph kernels to analyze 7,847 curated HAD-related
abstracts from PubMed. We extracted over 150 unique biomolecular events
including gene expression, regulation, binding, and localization and
constructed a weighted, undirected biomolecular event network comprising 97
nodes and 153 edges. Using the PageRank algorithm, we prioritized key
biomolecules based on their centrality within the event network. The top-ranked
proteins included Erythropoietin (EPO) (0.0163), Vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) (0.0148), Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha (0.0136),
Endothelial PAS Domain Protein 1 (EPAS1) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme
(ACE) (0.0119), Egl nine homolog 1 (EGLN1), Endothelin 1 (ET-1), and 70
kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70)(0.0118), all of which play crucial roles
in oxygen sensing, vascular remodeling, erythropoiesis, and blood pressure
regulation. Subnetwork analysis revealed three major functional clusters
centered on hypoxia response, inflammation, and stress adaptation pathways. Our
integrative approach demonstrates the utility of large-scale text mining and
graph-based analysis to uncover mechanistic insights and prioritize potential
biomarkers for high-altitude disease.

Conclusion: AQE通过LLM对齐技术有效解决了查询扩展中的问题，提升了检索效率和效果。

Abstract: With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), query generation
techniques that expand documents and queries with related terms are becoming
increasingly popular in the information retrieval field. Such techniques have
been shown to improve the effectiveness of traditional lexical retrieval
methods by dealing with the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent work has found
that generating queries with a greedy decoding strategy can produce sub-optimal
queries, including hallucinations, and proposed to filter out queries before
expansion. This `generate-then-filter' approach is costly, as it requires
generating multiple queries and applying a relevance model to all of them and
does not teach the LLM which of the generated queries is more effective for
expansion. To overcome such limitations, we propose Aligned Query Expansion
(AQE), a novel approach to enhance query expansion for passage retrieval in
open-domain question answering. AQE leverages recent techniques in LLM
alignment to fine-tune models for generating query expansions that directly
optimize the effectiveness of the retrieval task, eliminating the need for
additional filtering steps. This alignment ensures that queries are more
relevant, reducing computational costs while improving retrieval effectiveness.
Empirical evaluations show that AQE outperforms baseline models for query
expansion in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating
significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.

emails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of
enterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting
meaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to
structured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for
automating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors.
However, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its
application to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses
this limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem
(UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural
language processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to
effectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research
involved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent
evaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of UNDRESS in enhancing RPA capabilities
for unstructured data, providing a significant advancement in the field. The
findings suggest that this system could facilitate broader RPA adoption across
processes traditionally hindered by unstructured data, thereby improving
overall business process efficiency.

### [90] [Tool-to-Tool Matching Analysis Based Difference Score Computation Methods for Semiconductor Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10564)
*Sameera Bharadwaja H.,Siddhrath Jandial,Shashank S. Agashe,Rajesh Kumar Reddy Moore,Youngkwan Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的工具间匹配（TTTM）分析方法，解决了传统方法在异构设备环境中的局限性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTTM方法依赖静态配置数据或黄金参考，难以在商业生产线中获取，且不适用于异构设备环境。

Method: 提出基于数据方差和模式数量的新分析流程，包括单变量和多变量方法。

Result: 最佳单变量方法在方差和模式数量上的相关系数分别>0.95和>0.5；多变量方法与最佳单变量方法的相关系数>0.75。

Conclusion: 新方法在TTTM问题上表现优异，并对算法超参数敏感。

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber
matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional
TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden
reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line.
Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting,
where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different
equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these
issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance
and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves
a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes,
respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best
multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the
top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we
analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm
hyper-parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的线性自适应交叉熵损失函数，通过增加一个依赖于真实类预测概率的项，优化分类任务。在CIFAR-100数据集上测试表明，其分类准确率优于标准交叉熵损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失函数在分类任务中可能存在优化不足的问题，希望通过增加自适应项提升性能。

Method: 提出线性自适应交叉熵损失函数，引入一个依赖于真实类预测概率的额外项。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，新损失函数分类准确率优于标准交叉熵，且效率相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为损失函数设计提供了新思路，未来研究可进一步探索其潜力。

Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel
measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard
cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that
depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to
enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot
encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based
model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed
one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms
of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity,
achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy
loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for
future research into loss function design.

### [92] [An Adaptive Volatility-based Learning Rate Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10575)
*Kieran Chai Kai Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VolSched是一种新型自适应学习率调度器，通过动态调整学习率提升深度神经网络训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预定义和自适应学习率调度器可能导致次优泛化性能，需要更有效的动态调整方法。

Method: VolSched基于随机过程中的波动性概念（如几何布朗运动），通过长短周期准确率波动比动态调整学习率。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，VolSched显著提升ResNet-18和ResNet-34的top-1准确率（分别提高1.4和1.3个百分点），并找到更平坦的损失解。

Conclusion: VolSched通过动态调整学习率，有效探索损失空间，提升模型泛化性能。

Abstract: Effective learning rate (LR) scheduling is crucial for training deep neural
networks. However, popular pre-defined and adaptive schedulers can still lead
to suboptimal generalization. This paper introduces VolSched, a novel adaptive
LR scheduler inspired by the concept of volatility in stochastic processes like
Geometric Brownian Motion to dynamically adjust the learning rate. By
calculating the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility,
VolSched increases the LR to escape plateaus and decreases it to stabilize
training, allowing the model to explore the loss landscape more effectively. We
evaluate VolSched on the CIFAR-100 dataset against a strong baseline using a
standard augmentation pipeline. When paired with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, our
scheduler delivers consistent performance gains, improving top-1 accuracy by
1.4 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. Analysis of the loss curves reveals
that VolSched promotes a longer exploration phase. A quantitative analysis of
the Hessian shows that VolSched finds a final solution that is 38% flatter than
the next-best baseline, allowing the model to obtain wider minima and hence
better generalization performance.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习和Transformer在多个领域取得显著成功，但其理论基础仍有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 回顾了线性代数、概率和优化的关键概念，详细分析了多头自注意力机制和反向传播算法。

Result: 提出了一个通用近似定理，证明单层Transformer可以逼近任何连续序列到序列的映射。

Conclusion: 研究结果推动了Transformer模型的理论理解，缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the
backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many
domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer.
Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based
models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT
and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology.
However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this
paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and
Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts
from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning,
and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation
algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem
for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one
self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU
activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a
compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a
complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical
implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding
of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Conclusion: MH-FSF框架为特征选择研究提供了统一平台，促进了方法一致性和严谨性，为Android恶意软件检测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Feature selection is vital for building effective predictive models, as it
reduces dimensionality and emphasizes key features. However, current research
often suffers from limited benchmarking and reliance on proprietary datasets.
This severely hinders reproducibility and can negatively impact overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce the MH-FSF framework, a
comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform designed to facilitate the
reproduction and implementation of feature selection methods. Developed through
collaborative research, MH-FSF provides implementations of 17 methods (11
classical, 6 domain-specific) and enables systematic evaluation on 10 publicly
available Android malware datasets. Our results reveal performance variations
across both balanced and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the critical need
for data preprocessing and selection criteria that account for these
asymmetries. We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing
diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and
rigor. By providing this framework, we aim to significantly broaden the
existing literature and pave the way for new research directions in feature
selection, particularly within the context of Android malware detection.

Motivation: 在线学习中，混合类型特征、数据漂移和标签缺失是主要挑战，需要一种灵活且高效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: OL-MDISF通过构建潜在copula表示、检测漂移和结构感知伪标记来处理混合类型特征、数据漂移和标签缺失。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上的实验表明，OL-MDISF在CER趋势、消融研究和敏感性分析中表现优异。

Conclusion: OL-MDISF为复杂、弱监督的流数据在线学习提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible
learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still
faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data
streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric
modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an
abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often
infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To
address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed,
Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent
copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via
ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware
pseudo-labeling.
  This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF.
It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling,
drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of
experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios.
These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal
ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for
online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.

Motivation: 属性缺失图的深度图聚类是一个重要但研究不足的任务，现有补全方法未能充分利用节点邻域信息，导致结果不可靠。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的图数据集上，DTRGC显著提升了多种深度图聚类方法在属性缺失图上的性能。

Conclusion: DTRGC通过分阶段补全和聚类信息修正，有效解决了属性缺失图的聚类问题，为实际应用提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised
task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct
clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical
applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing
imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the
varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to
unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.
To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph
Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known
neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to
iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering
information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware
Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting
propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,
Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing
nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood
attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups
with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster
structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.
Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information
across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node
representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show
that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC
methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Conclusion: RedOne在SNS领域表现出强大的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking
services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant
challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement.
Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential
solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only
encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios
but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these
challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the
performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive
foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training
strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and
preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through
extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and
achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56%
in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore,
through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content
detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by
14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results
establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating
excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various
physical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by
the availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such
datasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very
few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate,
and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD,
a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML
in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout
heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop,
congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a
dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts
and placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML
accuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.

Abstract: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) relies heavily on seawater desalination to
meet over 90% of its drinking water needs. Desalination processes are highly
energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity
consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2
emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges
in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures,
salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational
and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through
photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.
  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling
architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series
and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other
meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses.
The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study
proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based
on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to
adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance
scheduling, and regulate energy source switching.
  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive
models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for
scenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support
system for climate-adaptive planning.

Result: 在真实结肠切片数据集和合成医学数据集上验证，FedGSCA在极端和异质噪声场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedGSCA显著提升模型稳定性和噪声处理能力，适用于真实医学联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Motivation: 传统扩展规律认为增加模型规模和训练数据能提升性能，但近期研究表明在大语言模型中存在性能提升减速的现象（称为次扩展）。本文旨在探究数据质量和训练策略对次扩展的影响。

Method: 通过对400多个模型进行广泛的实证分析，研究了数据密度和资源分配对性能的影响。

Result: 发现高数据密度和次优资源分配是导致次扩展的主要原因，并提出了一种新的次优扩展规律。

Conclusion: 强调了数据质量和多样性对模型性能的重要性，并提出了一种更准确的性能预测方法。

Abstract: Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that
increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent
studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where
performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as
sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of
data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive
empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and
non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling.
High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information,
while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance
improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts
performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality
and diversity.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm
design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within
search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms.
However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general
coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored
for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how
well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this
paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring
fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank
based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality,
then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM
outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm
design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform
their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and
match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover,
we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm
design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings.
These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in
algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

Conclusion: RL可能增强现有能力，而SFT可能替换旧技能；冻结部分模型参数的效果不明确。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code
datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly
popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a
comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same
model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains
on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU,
while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters
across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights
the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer
MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the
out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of
the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with
benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together,
our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing
capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

Method: 收集36种预训练算法创新数据，估算其开发所需的FLOP和硬件利用率，分析计算限制对这些创新的潜在影响。

Result: 发现计算需求每年翻倍，但即使严格的计算限制（如GPT-2的训练计算量或8个H100 GPU）仍能支持半数创新。

Conclusion: 计算限制不太可能显著减缓AI算法进展，因为许多创新在资源受限条件下仍可实现。

Abstract: Algorithmic innovation in the pretraining of large language models has driven
a massive reduction in the total compute required to reach a given level of
capability. In this paper we empirically investigate the compute requirements
for developing algorithmic innovations. We catalog 36 pre-training algorithmic
innovations used in Llama 3 and DeepSeek-V3. For each innovation we estimate
both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware
utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements
each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps
on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to
dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress. Even stringent compute caps -- such
as capping total operations to the compute used to train GPT-2 or capping
hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs -- could still have allowed for half of the
cataloged innovations.

### [105] [Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Fast and Data-Efficient Spectrum Allocation in Dynamic Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10619)
*Oluwaseyi Giwa,Tobi Awodunmila,Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin,Ahsan Bilal,Muhammad Ali Jamshed*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于元学习的框架，用于5G/6G网络中动态频谱分配，解决了传统深度强化学习的高样本复杂性和安全风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习在动态频谱分配中存在样本复杂性和安全风险，亟需一种更高效、安全的方法。

Method: 采用三种元学习架构（MAML、RNN和注意力增强RNN），在模拟动态IAB环境中与非元学习的PPO基线进行比较。

Result: 注意力元学习代理峰值吞吐量达48 Mbps，远超PPO的10 Mbps，且SINR和延迟违规减少50%以上，公平指数为0.7。

Conclusion: 元学习是复杂无线系统中智能控制的高效且安全的选择。

Abstract: The dynamic allocation of spectrum in 5G / 6G networks is critical to
efficient resource utilization. However, applying traditional deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is often infeasible due to its immense sample
complexity and the safety risks associated with unguided exploration, which can
cause severe network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a
meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy
and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement
three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML),
recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate
them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization
(PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB)
environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based
meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while
the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method
reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also
shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource
allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer
option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for time
series analytics, leveraging their massive parameters and the shared sequential
nature of textual and time series data. However, a cross-modality gap exists
between time series and textual data, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual
corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. In this tutorial, we
provide an up-to-date overview of LLM-based cross-modal time series analytics.
We introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into three groups
based on cross-modal modeling strategies, e.g., conversion, alignment, and
fusion, and then discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks.
In addition, we summarize several open challenges. This tutorial aims to expand
the practical application of LLMs in solving real-world problems in cross-modal
time series analytics while balancing effectiveness and efficiency.
Participants will gain a thorough understanding of current advancements,
methodologies, and future research directions in cross-modal time series
analytics.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足球比赛结果预测具有挑战性，现有方法常忽略球员和团队间的异质性交互，导致模型效果受限。

Method: HIGFormer结合了Player Interaction Network（球员交互网络）、Team Interaction Network（团队交互网络）和Match Comparison Transformer（比赛比较Transformer），通过多级交互框架建模比赛动态。

Result: 在WyScout Open Access Dataset上的实验表明，HIGFormer在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIGFormer不仅提升了预测准确性，还为球员表现评估和团队策略分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Predicting soccer match outcomes is a challenging task due to the inherently
unpredictable nature of the game and the numerous dynamic factors influencing
results. While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep
learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective
player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.
However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of
interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling
match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous
Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep
learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a
multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player
dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a
Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through
heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a
global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which
constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model
historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which
jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match
outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a
large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly
outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide
valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation,
offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，GHPO平均性能提升约5%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GHPO框架显著提升了训练稳定性和最终推理性能，为开发强大且稳健的推理模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language
models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However,
prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training
instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty
mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's
current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled
learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more
resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning
framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive
prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively
balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's
reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,
effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of
approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning
baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances
both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a
scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程隐半马尔可夫模型（GP-HSMM）在处理大规模数据时，由于需要计算N×N核矩阵的逆，计算成本高昂。

Method: 通过随机傅里叶特征近似高斯过程，将其转化为线性回归问题，避免了核矩阵的逆运算。

Result: 在CMU运动捕捉数据集上，新方法的分割性能与传统方法相当，但速度提高了约278倍。

Conclusion: RFF-GP-HSMM在保持性能的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于大规模时间序列数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RFF-GP-HSMM, a fast unsupervised time-series
segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features (RFF) to address
the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model
(GP-HSMM). GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring
inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number
of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a
significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method
approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving
expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix.
Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance
comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster
segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

Conclusion: GeoHopNet通过创新设计有效解决了大规模无人机动态选址问题，显著提升了计算效率和解决方案质量。

Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points
and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face
computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention
mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper
proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network
specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach
introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention
mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest
neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$
to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory
regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet
extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with
1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3
seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds
high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared
to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method
improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中模型在适应新任务时容易遗忘旧知识的问题，同时平衡可塑性和稳定性。

Method: 结合ReLUDown（轻量级激活修改）和Decreasing Backpropagation（梯度调度方案），防止神经元休眠并保护早期层。

Result: 在Continual ImageNet上表现优于或匹配现有方法，同时降低计算成本。

Conclusion: RDBP为持续学习提供了实用解决方案，并可作为未来方法的基准。

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a
continuous stream of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, yet existing
approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability.
We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two
complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that
preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing
Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and
stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP
thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a
clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be
measured.

Motivation: 解决温度缩放和流形逼近问题，统一不确定性校准和潜在控制。

Method: 使用对角高斯分布逻辑，最小化预测高斯分布与单位各向同性高斯之间的KL散度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上表现优于softmax分类器，提升了鲁棒性、校准性和潜在分离性。

Conclusion: ZClassifier在分类和生成任务中表现出色，提供了一种概率化的统一框架。

Abstract: We introduce a novel classification framework, ZClassifier, that replaces
conventional deterministic logits with diagonal Gaussian-distributed logits.
Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold
approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies
uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic
manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric
consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that ZClassifier
improves over softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent
separation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness for classifier-guided
generation by interpreting logits as Gaussian semantic potentials.

Abstract: A growing issue within conservation bioacoustics is the task of analysing the
vast amount of data generated from the use of passive acoustic monitoring
devices. In this paper, we present an alternative AI model which has the
potential to help alleviate this problem. Our model formulation addresses the
key issues encountered when using current AI models for bioacoustic analysis,
namely the: limited training data available; environmental impact, particularly
in energy consumption and carbon footprint of training and implementing these
models; and associated hardware requirements. The model developed in this work
uses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network
to store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify
species. Training is rapid ($3$\,ms), as only one representative signal is
required for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only
$5.4$\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat
recordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with
a small memory footprint of $144.09$\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low
computational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard
personal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing
devices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\%$ precision on the
dataset used to evaluate the model. In fact, we could not find a single case of
disagreement between model and manual identification via expert field guides.
Although a dataset of bat echolocation calls was chosen to demo this
first-of-its-kind AI model, trained on only two representative calls, the model
is not species specific. In conclusion, we propose an equitable AI model that
has the potential to be a game changer for fast, lightweight, sustainable,
transparent, explainable and accurate bioacoustic analysis.

Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human
cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems
with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical
generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement
symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of
radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a
group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining
characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder,
when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our
analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and
we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit
differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks
in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition
using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a
function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can
achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function,
and that learning speed is closely correlated with carry function structure. We
then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.

Conclusion: 数据驱动的无似然代理方法能够在复杂、部分观测的离散事件系统中实现准确、鲁棒和实时的参数恢复。

Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for
modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems
biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in
particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit
likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate
(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework
that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions
directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a
lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on
Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under
realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout
provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On
synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function
coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than
traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven,
likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter
recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.

Result: 在数据污染的情况下，该方法实现了对真实DRO目标值的$O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$估计误差。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为数据污染和分布偏移双重挑战下的学习提供了严格的理论保证和高效的计算方法。

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a framework for
decision-making under distributional uncertainty, yet its effectiveness can be
compromised by outliers in the training data. This paper introduces a
principled approach to simultaneously address both challenges. We focus on
optimizing Wasserstein-1 DRO objectives for generalized linear models with
convex Lipschitz loss functions, where an $\epsilon$-fraction of the training
data is adversarially corrupted. Our primary contribution lies in a novel
modeling framework that integrates robustness against training data
contamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an
efficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting
optimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of
$O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the
contaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption. This work
establishes the first rigorous guarantees, supported by efficient computation,
for learning under the dual challenges of data contamination and distributional
shifts.

Abstract: Grounding language in complex perception (e.g. pixels) and action is a key
challenge when building situated agents that can interact with humans via
language. In past works, this is often solved via manual design of the language
grounding or by curating massive datasets relating language to elements of the
environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, a neurosymbolic framework for
grounding formal language from data, and eliciting behaviours by directly
tasking RL agents through this language. By virtue of data-driven learning, our
framework avoids the manual design of domain-specific elements like reward
functions or symbol detectors. By virtue of compositional formal language
semantics, our framework achieves data-efficient grounding and generalization
to arbitrary language compositions. Experiments on an image-based gridworld and
a MuJoCo robotics domain show that our approach reliably maps formal language
instructions to behaviours with limited data while end-to-end, data-driven
approaches fail.

Conclusion: 该框架为生成推理提供了基础设施，降低了研究门槛。

Abstract: We present Spatial Reasoners, a software framework to perform spatial
reasoning over continuous variables with generative denoising models. Denoising
generative models have become the de-facto standard for image generation, due
to their effectiveness in sampling from complex, high-dimensional
distributions. Recently, they have started being explored in the context of
reasoning over multiple continuous variables. Providing infrastructure for
generative reasoning with such models requires a high effort, due to a wide
range of different denoising formulations, samplers, and inference strategies.
Our presented framework aims to facilitate research in this area, providing
easy-to-use interfaces to control variable mapping from arbitrary data domains,
generative model paradigms, and inference strategies. Spatial Reasoners are
openly available at https://spatialreasoners.github.io/

Conclusion: Phy-SSM通过结合物理知识显著提升了长期预测性能，适用于复杂环境中的动态系统建模。

Abstract: This work aims to address the problem of long-term dynamic forecasting in
complex environments where data are noisy and irregularly sampled. While recent
studies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these
approaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term
extrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,
we propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics
knowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in
complex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture
long-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical
systems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization
ability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially
known physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system
dynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a
Phy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce
a physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align
with system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the
solutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world
applications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and
COVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of
Phy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation
tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/511205787/Phy_SSM-ICML2025.

Abstract: This paper introduces the framework of multi-armed sampling, as the sampling
counterpart to the optimization problem of multi-arm bandits. Our primary
motivation is to rigorously examine the exploration-exploitation trade-off in
the context of sampling. We systematically define plausible notions of regret
for this framework and establish corresponding lower bounds. We then propose a
simple algorithm that achieves these optimal regret bounds. Our theoretical
results demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require
exploration. To further connect our findings with those of multi-armed bandits,
we define a continuous family of problems and associated regret measures that
smoothly interpolates and unifies multi-armed sampling and multi-armed bandit
problems using a temperature parameter. We believe the multi-armed sampling
framework, and our findings in this setting can have a foundational role in the
study of sampling including recent neural samplers, akin to the role of
multi-armed bandits in reinforcement learning. In particular, our work sheds
light on the need for exploration and the convergence properties of algorithm
for entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, fine-tuning of pretrained
models and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).

Conclusion: 新框架和模型有效解决了域外干预下的因果动态变化问题，提升了ATE估计的准确性。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between event pairs in a temporal sequence is
applicable in many domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and
transportation. Most existing work on causal inference primarily focuses on
event types within the designated domain, without considering the impact of
exogenous out-of-domain interventions. In real-world settings, these
out-of-domain interventions can significantly alter causal dynamics. To address
this gap, we propose a new causal framework to define average treatment effect
(ATE), beyond independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data in classic
Rubin's causal framework, to capture the causal relation shift between events
of temporal process under out-of-domain intervention. We design an unbiased ATE
estimator, and devise a Transformer-based neural network model to handle both
long-range temporal dependencies and local patterns while integrating
out-of-domain intervention information into process modeling. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms baselines in ATE estimation and goodness-of-fit under
out-of-domain-augmented point processes.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a theoretical foundation

regret and adapts favourably in dynamic action spaces. Second, we provide
parallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is
critical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning)

pipeline, and demonstrate on a benchmark with over 10,000 tools that SC-based
retrieval enables an LLM to effectively orchestrate over a large action space.
These findings provide a comprehensive guide to building more sample-efficient,
adaptive, and scalable orchestration agents.

Result: 实验表明，GCN在小规模训练后，能在大规模实例中实现90%以上的最优性，且速度快于现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: GCN为产品组合优化提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于模型未知但数据可用的场景。

Abstract: Assortment optimization involves selecting a subset of substitutable products
(subject to certain constraints) to maximize the expected revenue. It is a
classic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various
industries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial
and non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph concolutional
networks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment
optimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a
graph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the
patterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies
based on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize
across inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale
instances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20
products), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+
optimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within
seconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and
efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a model-free setting where
the underlying choice model is unknown but transaction data is available. We
also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed policies in this setting.

Result: 在D4RL基准数据集上表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了分布偏移问题，性能优越，代码已开源。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a
static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data
collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is
distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset
distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To
mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many
existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the
$f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the
Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures
the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks
(ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the
Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding
adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates
comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL
benchmark dataset. The code is available at

Result: 所有协作方法均比非协作方法表现出更高的群体韧性。

Conclusion: 协作是多智能体强化学习中提升群体韧性的关键因素。

Abstract: To effectively operate in various dynamic scenarios, RL agents must be
resilient to unexpected changes in their environment. Previous work on this
form of resilience has focused on single-agent settings. In this work, we
introduce and formalize a multi-agent variant of resilience, which we term
group resilience. We further hypothesize that collaboration with other agents
is key to achieving group resilience; collaborating agents adapt better to
environmental perturbations in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
settings. We test our hypothesis empirically by evaluating different
collaboration protocols and examining their effect on group resilience. Our
experiments show that all the examined collaborative approaches achieve higher
group resilience than their non-collaborative counterparts.

Abstract: Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving
reinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses.
Despite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world
reappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily
verbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is
often impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the
effectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based
augmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image
diffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we
introduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via
spoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally
congruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned
IP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'
reappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,
externalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we
conducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive
emotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive
images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without
AI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal
significantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control
conditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between
participant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,
suggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These
findings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive
reappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI,
affective computing, and therapeutic technology.

Conclusion: GALDS为神经元网络物质运输模拟提供了一种高效且准确的替代方法。

Abstract: Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which
play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport.
Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for
understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational
challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional
approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent
properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state
parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for
computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a
Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is
specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in
neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent
representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration
profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global
graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent
space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration
of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models
with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component
effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated
through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport
examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum
relative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to
previous surrogate model approaches.

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural
networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein
generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively
capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data
noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components.
Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental
examples, showcasing its broad applicability in various domains, from
scientific research to engineered systems, and enabling the discovery of full

Result: 提出了一种新方法，保护模型性能免受自发或对抗性遗忘的副作用影响。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了对抗性遗忘带来的性能下降问题。

Abstract: AI models need to be unlearned to fulfill the requirements of legal acts such
as the AI Act or GDPR, and also because of the need to remove toxic content,
debiasing, the impact of malicious instances, or changes in the data
distribution structure in which a model works. Unfortunately, removing
knowledge may cause undesirable side effects, such as a deterioration in model
performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial
unlearning, where a malicious party intentionally sends unlearn requests to
deteriorate the model's performance maximally. We show that this phenomenon and
the adversary's capabilities depend on many factors, primarily on the backbone
model itself and strategy/limitations in selecting data to be unlearned. The
main result of this work is a new method of protecting model performance from
these side effects, both in the case of unlearned behavior resulting from
spontaneous processes and adversary actions.

Conclusion: 提出的验证方案利用生产系统评估模型在RL策略下的反事实库存状态，确保鲁棒性。

Abstract: We study the problem of forecasting the number of units fulfilled (or
``drained'') from each inventory warehouse to meet customer demand, along with
the associated outbound shipping costs. The actual drain and shipping costs are
determined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution
of customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be
delivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for
regional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated
into a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be
differentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can
be used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow
and costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this
as a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of
outbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,
conditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure
robustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution
scenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories. We propose a validation
scheme that leverages production systems to evaluate the drain model on
counterfactual inventory states induced by RL policies. Preliminary results
demonstrate the model's accuracy within the in-distribution setting.

Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法假设数据难度在类别间均匀分布，忽略了类别间难度差异，导致在真实场景（如网络安全和医疗影像）中性能下降。

Method: 提出类别难度可分性系数（CDSC），并设计类别比例均衡的采样策略（如CCS-CP）。

Conclusion: 显式建模类别难度可分性可提升数据剪枝的效率和鲁棒性，尤其适用于高噪声、不平衡和大规模数据集。

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient
machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning
the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often
relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most
existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,
overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such
as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often
clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and
introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a
quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with
performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to
overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.
  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple
sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and
medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data
efficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a
class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows
remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and
recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best
method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and
4.11% in recall.
  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,
imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly
modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and
generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Peptide de novo sequencing is a method used to reconstruct amino acid
sequences from tandem mass spectrometry data without relying on existing
protein sequence databases. Traditional deep learning approaches, such as
Casanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids
sequentially. Subsequently, they encounter cascading errors and fail to
leverage high-confidence regions effectively. To address these issues, this
paper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data
domain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence
generation to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction
accuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs,
knapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search
did not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer
decoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide
precision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the
DINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in
amino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive
decoder-based Casanovo model. These findings highlight the potential of
diffusion decoders to not only enhance model sensitivity but also drive
significant advancements in peptide de novo sequencing.

Result: 在Kepler和TESS数据集的实验中，StellarF表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StellarF为天体物理学研究和跨学科应用提供了新方法框架。

Abstract: Stellar flare forecasting, a critical research frontier in astronomy, offers
profound insights into stellar activity. However, the field is constrained by
both the sparsity of recorded flare events and the absence of domain-specific
large-scale predictive models. To address these challenges, this study
introduces StellarF (Stellar Flare Forecasting), a novel large model that
leverages Low-Rank (LoRA) and Adapter techniques to parameter-efficient
learning for stellar flare forecasting. At its core, StellarF integrates an
flare statistical information module with a historical flare record module,
enabling multi-scale pattern recognition from observational data. Extensive
experiments on our self-constructed datasets (derived from Kepler and TESS
light curves) demonstrate that StellarF achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing methods. The proposed prediction paradigm establishes a
novel methodological framework for advancing astrophysical research and
cross-disciplinary applications.

TL;DR: ClusterEnv是一个轻量级、与学习器无关的分布式环境执行接口，采用DETACH模式解耦模拟与训练，并通过AAPS机制减少同步开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架将模拟、学习逻辑和编排耦合为单一系统，限制了模块化和复用性。

Method: ClusterEnv通过DETACH模式将reset()和step()操作卸载到远程工作节点，同时保持学习集中化；提出AAPS机制以减少策略陈旧性。

Result: 实验表明，AAPS在离散控制任务中实现了高样本效率，且权重更新次数显著减少。

Conclusion: ClusterEnv无缝集成到现有RL流程中，支持多种学习方法，代码改动极小。

Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) workloads often requires distributing
environment simulation across compute clusters. Existing frameworks entangle
simulation, learning logic, and orchestration into monolithic systems, limiting
modularity and reusability. We present ClusterEnv, a lightweight,
learner-agnostic interface for distributed environment execution that mirrors
the Gymnasium API. ClusterEnv introduces the DETACH pattern, which decouples
simulation from training by offloading reset() and step() operations to remote
workers while keeping learning centralized. To address policy staleness in
distributed execution, we propose Adaptive Actor Policy Synchronization (AAPS),
a divergence-triggered update mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead
without sacrificing performance. ClusterEnv integrates cleanly into existing RL
pipelines, supports both on-policy and off-policy methods, and requires minimal
code changes. Experiments on discrete control tasks demonstrate that AAPS
achieves high sample efficiency with significantly fewer weight updates. Source

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究奖励函数中终端目标和工具目标的混淆如何影响强化学习的性能，揭示其对真实目标表达的扭曲。

Method: 通过一个简单示例，展示终端目标与工具目标的轻微混淆如何导致严重不对齐，并分析其本质特性。

Result: 研究表明，奖励函数中目标混淆会显著降低性能，尤其是在特定环境中。

Conclusion: 论文强调了区分终端目标和工具目标的重要性，并讨论了奖励学习中如何避免这一问题。

Abstract: Reward functions, learned or manually specified, are rarely perfect. Instead
of accurately expressing human goals, these reward functions are often
distorted by human beliefs about how best to achieve those goals. Specifically,
these reward functions often express a combination of the human's terminal
goals -- those which are ends in themselves -- and the human's instrumental
goals -- those which are means to an end. We formulate a simple example in
which even slight conflation of instrumental and terminal goals results in
severe misalignment: optimizing the misspecified reward function results in
poor performance when measured by the true reward function. This example
distills the essential properties of environments that make reinforcement
learning highly sensitive to conflation of instrumental and terminal goals. We
discuss how this issue can arise with a common approach to reward learning and
how it can manifest in real environments.

### [140] [Crafting Imperceptible On-Manifold Adversarial Attacks for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10998)
*Zhipeng He,Alexander Stevens,Chun Ouyang,Johannes De Smedt,Alistair Barros,Catarina Moreira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于混合输入变分自编码器（VAE）的潜在空间扰动框架，用于生成难以察觉的对抗样本，解决了表格数据中异质特征的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的异质性（混合分类和数值特征）使得对抗攻击难以定义直观的相似性度量，传统梯度方法生成的对抗样本容易偏离原始数据分布。

Method: 使用混合输入VAE将分类嵌入和数值特征整合到统一的潜在流形中，生成保持统计一致性的对抗样本，并引入In-Distribution Success Rate（IDSR）作为评估指标。

Result: 在六个公开数据集和三种模型架构上的实验表明，该方法生成的对抗样本具有更低的异常率和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: VAE框架在足够训练数据下具有优越的实用性，强调了在表格数据上保持流形扰动的重要性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct
from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical
and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual
similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it
difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional
gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing
adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making
them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a
mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial
examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical
features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve
statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to
measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly
available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method
achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance
compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted
from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes
hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative
architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically
on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient
training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold
perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a
robust approach for practical deployment. The source code can be accessed

Motivation: Muon优化器在大规模模型训练中表现优异，但仍有改进空间，AdaMuon旨在进一步提升其效率和适应性。

Method: AdaMuon引入两个模块：1) 参数级第二矩调制，捕捉正交梯度更新；2) RMS对齐的重新缩放，调整更新幅度。

Result: 实验表明，AdaMuon在多种模型规模和不同学习率下均优于Muon，收敛更快且稳定。

Conclusion: AdaMuon无需额外调参，可直接集成到现有Muon训练流程中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: We propose AdaMuon, an adaptive learning-rate framework built upon the
recently validated Muon optimizer, which has demonstrated substantial
efficiency gains over AdamW in large-scale model training. AdaMuon augments
Muon with two mutually dependent modules: (1) a per-parameter second-moment
modulation that captures orthogonal gradient updates to ensure update-level
adaptivity, and (2) a RMS-aligned rescaling that regulates the overall update
magnitude by aligning it with the intrinsic structure of the parameter space.
Empirical results on multiple model scales and learning-rate regimes confirm
that AdaMuon consistently outperforms the original Muon, delivering higher
acceleration in convergence while maintaining training stability. Our method
introduces no additional tuning burden and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing Muon training pipelines.

Motivation: 探索从易获取的温度数据预测TKE的可能性，以改进火灾环境模型和操作策略。

Method: 使用深度神经网络、随机森林回归、梯度提升和高斯过程回归等机器学习模型分析温度扰动与TKE的关系。

Result: 尽管预测变量与目标变量相关性较弱，机器学习模型仍能较准确地预测TKE，回归模型表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 机器学习在火灾环境数据分析中具有重要价值，有助于推动火灾研究和管理实践的进步。

Abstract: This study explores the potential for predicting turbulent kinetic energy
(TKE) from more readily acquired temperature data using temperature profiles
and turbulence data collected concurrently at 10 Hz during a small experimental
prescribed burn in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Machine learning models,
including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and
Gaussian Process Regressor, were employed to assess the potential to predict
TKE from temperature perturbations and explore temporal and spatial dynamics of
correlations. Data visualization and correlation analyses revealed patterns and
relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into
the underlying dynamics. More accurate predictions of TKE were achieved by
employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between
the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant
success, particularly from regression models, in accurately predicting the TKE.
The findings of this study demonstrate a novel numerical approach to
identifying new relationships between temperature and airflow processes in and
around the fire environment. These relationships can help refine our
understanding of combustion environment processes and the coupling and
decoupling of fire environment processes necessary for improving fire
operations strategy and fire and smoke model predictions. The findings of this
study additionally highlight the valuable role of machine learning techniques
in analyzing the complex large datasets of the fire environments, showcasing
their potential to advance fire research and management practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补偿的权重校准方法假设一阶项可忽略，但渐进补偿过程导致一阶偏差累积，这一假设存在缺陷。

Method: FOEM通过直接计算潜在权重与全精度权重的差异近似梯度，避免高成本的反向传播，并利用预计算的Cholesky因子高效恢复Hessian子矩阵的逆。

Result: 在3位权重量化下，FOEM将Llama3-8B的困惑度降低89.6%，并将Llama3-70B的5-shot MMLU准确率从51.7%提升至74.9%。

Conclusion: FOEM在多种模型和基准测试中表现优异，可无缝集成先进技术，进一步缩小与全精度基线的差距。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is

Conclusion: REPPO成功结合了路径策略梯度的效率和在线学习的简单性，为策略优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Score-function policy gradients have delivered strong results in
game-playing, robotics and language-model fine-tuning. Yet its high-variance
often undermines training stability. On the other hand, pathwise policy
gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by
an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to
train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to
construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training
Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using
pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to
balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for
stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that
facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we
propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient
on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy
gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard
on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical
performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint
as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two
standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统深度学习和图神经网络在室内定位中因假设欧几里得空间和无法处理非均匀噪声分布，导致泛化能力差，尤其在设备异构环境下表现不佳。

Conclusion: GATE通过创新方法有效解决了室内定位中的噪声和设备异构性问题，显著提升了定位精度。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart
environments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)
fingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its
compatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve
accuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but
they assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to
incorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of
real-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous
mobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS
readings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models
by encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal
relationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise
distributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded
accuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these
challenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive
graph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor
state-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to
mitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces
1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a
novel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind
spot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic
graph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor
spaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices
demonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and
1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor
localization frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MILP缺乏有效的实例比较结构，现有相似性度量方法精度不足或依赖标签数据。

Method: 通过离散化右侧值、权重和变量，借鉴Earth mover's距离，提出一种数学距离度量方法，包括精确和贪婪两种变体。

Result: 贪婪版本在保持高精度的同时速度提升近200倍，优于现有非学习方法，接近监督分类器性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为MILP实例比较提供了有效的数学距离度量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for addressing a
wide range of real-world problems, but it lacks a clear structure for comparing
instances. A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful
relationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance
set heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when
machine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision
in identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits
their applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived
directly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand
sides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws
inspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in
weight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach
naturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an
exact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,
using the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric
contribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves
accuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times
faster. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including feature-based,
image-based, and neural network models, our unsupervised method consistently
outperforms all non-learned approaches and rivals the performance of a
supervised classifier on class and subclass grouping tasks.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection using traditional rule based or deep learning based

Conclusion: 基于时间价值的BOCPD框架为无人机提供了更高效的欺骗攻击检测手段，增强了对抗隐蔽攻击的韧性。

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time
localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to
sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to
deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly
perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without
triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional
distributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a
threshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and
timely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are
essential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with
alternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy
adversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point
detection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates
from a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural
deviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal
value-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors,
temporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test,
achieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative
rates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural
network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these
models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most
existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the
construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in
substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing
penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal
relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural
Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model
and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and
output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific
time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures
such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical
simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC
outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational
overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder
urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in
reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

*Shiyi Yang,Xiaoxue Yu,Rongpeng Li,Jianhang Zhu,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AirLLM提出了一种基于分层扩散策略的通信感知LoRA适应框架，通过强化学习和扩散模型优化LoRA的秩配置，显著提升了远程微调效率并降低了传输成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘设备上运行大型语言模型时通信带宽和计算资源受限的问题，以及现有LoRA方法中固定或启发式秩配置的不足。

Method: 结合PPO生成粗粒度决策和DDIM细化秩向量，形成任务和信道自适应的配置，并通过CFG优化模块间的对齐。

Result: 在不同信噪比下，AirLLM显著提升了微调性能并减少了传输成本。

Conclusion: AirLLM通过强化学习和扩散模型的结合，为远程LoRA微调提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly
challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and
memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.
Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ
fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air
transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address
this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework
for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank
configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted
projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential
decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates
coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic
complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The
two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.
Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM
consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing
transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,
diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning
over the air.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中频繁交换模型更新导致通信开销大，需解决此问题。

Method: 采用低秩近似神经网络梯度和量化技术。

Result: 显著降低了网络负载，对模型精度影响极小。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了联邦学习的通信效率问题。

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables multiple
devices (i.e., agents) to train a shared model cooperatively without exchanging
raw data. This technique keeps data localized on user devices, ensuring privacy
and security, while each agent trains the model on their own data and only
shares model updates. The communication overhead is a significant challenge due
to the frequent exchange of model updates between the agents and the central
server. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning
scheme that utilizes low-rank approximation of neural network gradients and
quantization to significantly reduce the network load of the decentralized
learning process with minimal impact on the model's accuracy.

Motivation: 心脏病是全球健康问题，传统诊断方法准确性不足，机器学习可提升诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Heart Disease数据集（1,035例），应用SMOTE生成10万合成数据点，评估分类和回归模型的性能。

Result: 随机森林分类准确率达97.2%（真实数据）和97.6%（合成数据）；线性回归R2最高（0.992和0.984）。

Conclusion: 机器学习可显著改善心脏病诊断和风险预测，支持早期干预和临床决策。

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions
with limited access to medical resources and diagnostic facilities. Traditional
diagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease
risks, leading to adverse outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to
significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and speed of heart disease
diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines
classification models for heart disease detection and regression models for
risk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035
cases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an
additional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to
evaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random
Forest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on
real data and 97.6% on synthetic data. For regression tasks, Linear Regression
demonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic
datasets, respectively, with the lowest error metrics. Additionally,
Explainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the
models. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to
revolutionize heart disease diagnosis and risk prediction, thereby facilitating
early intervention and enhancing clinical decision-making.

Result: 理论证明框架在特定隐私要求下可实现最优预测性能，并通过模拟和真实数据实验验证。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效平衡隐私保护和预测性能，适用于协作医疗预测平台。

Abstract: Online collaborative medical prediction platforms offer convenience and
real-time feedback by leveraging massive electronic health records. However,
growing concerns about privacy and low prediction quality can deter patient
participation and doctor cooperation. In this paper, we first clarify the
privacy attacks, namely attribute attacks targeting patients and model
extraction attacks targeting doctors, and specify the corresponding privacy
principles. We then propose a privacy-preserving mechanism and integrate it
into a novel one-shot distributed learning framework, aiming to simultaneously
meet both privacy requirements and prediction performance objectives. Within
the framework of statistical learning theory, we theoretically demonstrate that
the proposed distributed learning framework can achieve the optimal prediction
performance under specific privacy requirements. We further validate the
developed privacy-preserving collaborative medical prediction platform through
both toy simulations and real-world data experiments.

Result: 在一维空间中，等幅数据可保证全局收敛；但在高维空间中仍可能出现循环行为。

Conclusion: 希望进一步研究循环行为在实际数据集中的普遍性，并寻找保证全局收敛的充分条件。

Abstract: Gradient descent (GD) on logistic regression has many fascinating properties.
When the dataset is linearly separable, it is known that the iterates converge
in direction to the maximum-margin separator regardless of how large the step
size is. In the non-separable case, however, it has been shown that GD can
exhibit a cycling behaviour even when the step sizes is still below the
stability threshold $2/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of
the Hessian at the solution. This short paper explores whether restricting the
data to have equal magnitude is a sufficient condition for global convergence,
under any step size below the stability threshold. We prove that this is true
in a one dimensional space, but in higher dimensions cycling behaviour can
still occur. We hope to inspire further studies on quantifying how common these
cycles are in realistic datasets, as well as finding sufficient conditions to
guarantee global convergence with large step sizes.

Result: 新数据集实验和在线A/B测试验证了模型的有效性，并已部署于大型电商平台。

Conclusion: 生成模型可显著提升CTR预测性能，未来将公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models are integral to a myriad of
industrial settings, such as personalized search advertising. Current methods
typically involve feature extraction from users' historical behavior sequences
combined with product information, feeding into a discriminative model that is
trained on user feedback to estimate CTR. With the success of models such as
GPT, the potential for generative models to enrich expressive power beyond
discriminative models has become apparent. In light of this, we introduce a
novel model that leverages generative models to enhance the precision of CTR
predictions in discriminative models. To reconcile the disparate data
aggregation needs of both model types, we design a two-stage training process:
1) Generative pre-training for next-item prediction with the given item
category in user behavior sequences; 2) Fine-tuning the well-trained generative
model within a discriminative CTR prediction framework. Our method's efficacy
is substantiated through extensive experiments on a new dataset, and its
significant utility is further corroborated by online A/B testing results.
Currently, the model is deployed on one of the world's largest e-commerce
platforms, and we intend to release the associated code and dataset in the
future.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks, particularly in computer vision tasks, often

integrates Adam's adaptive moment estimation with Lyapunov-based stability
mechanisms. LyAm dynamically adjusts the learning rate using Lyapunov stability
theory to enhance convergence robustness and mitigate training noise. We
provide a rigorous theoretical framework proving the convergence guarantees of
LyAm in complex, non-convex settings. Extensive experiments on like as CIFAR-10

optimizers in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and stability, establishing

Motivation: 深度强化学习通常需要大量训练步骤和经验回放缓冲区，导致高计算和资源需求。

Method: 利用Neyman-Rubin潜在结果框架，建立对事实损失的因果界限，并通过存储历史价值网络输出来有效利用数据。

Result: 在Atari 2600和MuJoCo领域的实验中，奖励比例提高了2427%，经验回放缓冲区大小减少了96%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了样本效率，且成本可忽略。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex
decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a
substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer,
leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these
challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that
focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the
factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is
computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer,
effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments
across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and
SAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents
without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up
to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.

Motivation: 研究SGD在过参数化模型训练、持续学习中的遗忘以及随机Kaczmarz方法收敛中的应用。

Method: 通过分析SGD在β平滑凸损失函数上的行为，推导出最后迭代的期望超额风险表达式。

Result: 在优化步长下，最后迭代的收敛速率为O(1/T + σ⋆/√T)，当σ⋆=0时，收敛速率提升至O(1/√T)。

Conclusion: 扩展了Varre等人的结果，并改进了Evron等人在线性回归中的收敛速率。

Abstract: We study population convergence guarantees of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) for smooth convex objectives in the interpolation regime, where the noise
at optimum is zero or near zero. The behavior of the last iterate of SGD in
this setting -- particularly with large (constant) stepsizes -- has received
growing attention in recent years due to implications for the training of
over-parameterized models, as well as to analyzing forgetting in continual
learning and to understanding the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz method
for solving linear systems. We establish that after $T$ steps of SGD on
$\beta$-smooth convex loss functions with stepsize $\eta \leq 1/\beta$, the
last iterate exhibits expected excess risk $\widetilde{O}(1/(\eta
T^{1-\beta\eta/2}) + \eta T^{\beta\eta/2} \sigma_\star^2)$, where
$\sigma_\star^2$ denotes the variance of the stochastic gradients at the
optimum. In particular, for a well-tuned stepsize we obtain a near optimal
$\widetilde{O}(1/T + \sigma_\star/\sqrt{T})$ rate for the last iterate,
extending the results of Varre et al. (2021) beyond least squares regression;
and when $\sigma_\star=0$ we obtain a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ with
$\eta=1/\beta$, improving upon the best-known $O(T^{-1/4})$ rate recently
established by Evron et al. (2025) in the special case of realizable linear
regression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在高风险决策中可能放大偏见的问题，确保其可信赖性。

Method: 通过训练一个公平奖励模型（FRM），为语言模型的推理过程分配公平性分数，从而在决策链中减少偏见。

Result: FRM无需额外微调即可跨任务、领域和模型家族迁移，并在实际任务中提升公平性且保持或超越基线准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险决策中语言模型的公平使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to support high-stakes decisions,
potentially influencing who is granted bail or receives a loan. Naive
chain-of-thought sampling can improve average decision accuracy, but has also
been shown to amplify unfair bias. To address this challenge and enable the
trustworthy use of reasoning models in high-stakes decision-making, we propose
a framework for training a generalizable Fairness Reward Model (FRM). Our model
assigns a fairness score to LLM reasoning, enabling the system to down-weight
biased trajectories and favor equitable ones when aggregating decisions across
reasoning chains. We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on
weakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning,
transfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional
fine-tuning. Applied to real-world decision-making tasks including recidivism
prediction and social media moderation, we show that our approach consistently
improves fairness while matching, or even surpassing, baseline accuracy.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示独立性假设对NeSy预测器学习和不确定性建模的负面影响，并验证其在特定场景下的限制。

Method: 通过形式化分析，证明了独立性假设会导致模型无法表示某些概念组合的不确定性。

Result: 结果表明，独立性假设会阻碍模型对推理捷径的识别，导致预测正确但理由错误的行为。

Conclusion: 结论指出独立性假设在NeSy系统中存在根本性缺陷，需重新审视其适用性。

Abstract: The ubiquitous independence assumption among symbolic concepts in
neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors is a convenient simplification: NeSy predictors
use it to speed up probabilistic reasoning. Recent works like van Krieken et
al. (2024) and Marconato et al. (2024) argued that the independence assumption
can hinder learning of NeSy predictors and, more crucially, prevent them from
correctly modelling uncertainty. There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy
community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually
limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle
this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic
concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain
concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of reasoning shortcuts,
i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct
downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons.

Motivation: 传统RL依赖反向传播，需存储激活值且易出现梯度消失或爆炸问题，影响学习效果。

Method: 利用多维尺度匹配原则设计局部层损失，结合奖励驱动，实现前向传播中的分层训练。

Result: 在RL基准测试中表现与传统BP方法相当，且稳定性、一致性及挑战性环境中性能更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效替代反向传播，提升训练效率和稳定性，适用于复杂RL任务。

Abstract: Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on
backpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward
pass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error
signals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding
gradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a
novel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals
during the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,
layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from
multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This
method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed
during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and
storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy
gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this
backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their
classical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances
stability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance
especially in challenging environments.

Conclusion: SPaRK通过显式工具多样性增强推理能力，为语言模型的工具探索提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that teaches large language models to explore
diverse tool usage patterns beyond conventional high-temperature sampling.
Building on recent advances in step-wise reinforcement learning, we introduce a
dual-objective reward system that simultaneously optimizes for answer quality
and tool diversity, training a Llama-3.1 8B model through offline PPO on
synthetically generated trajectories from the MMLU-Pro dataset. Our approach
uniquely employs a rarity-first exploitation strategy where a GPT-4o judge
scores candidate actions across eight distinct tools plus chain-of-thought
reasoning, with the policy favoring less-frequently used but still viable tools
to encourage systematic exploration. Empirical results demonstrate that SPaRK
achieves competitive performance across 14 MMLU-Pro categories while exhibiting
significantly higher entropy in tool selection compared to both baseline and
supervised fine-tuning approaches, suggesting that algorithmic exploration
through explicit tool diversity can enhance reasoning capabilities without
sacrificing accuracy.

Motivation: 人类能够在不遗忘旧知识的情况下学习新信息，而神经网络则存在灾难性遗忘问题。研究旨在通过模拟人脑的互补学习系统（CLS）来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合VAE的模式完成能力和MHN的模式分离能力，构建了一个神经合理的持续学习模型，并在Split-MNIST任务上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 通过模拟模式分离和模式完成功能，该研究为生物和人工系统中的记忆巩固、泛化和持续学习提供了功能模板。

Abstract: Learning new information without forgetting prior knowledge is central to
human intelligence. In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic
forgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned
tasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS)
theory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain
has distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and
pattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture
these complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization
capabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage
properties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally
plausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST
task, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to
state-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting.
Representational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the
VAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By
capturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work
provides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation,
generalization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为R-MTGB的新型多任务梯度提升框架，通过分块学习、任务分区和微调，有效处理多任务学习中的异常任务，提升整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中，异常任务（如对抗性任务）会损害模型性能，需要一种能自动检测并适应任务异质性的方法。

Method: R-MTGB框架分为三部分：学习共享模式、正则化参数分区任务、微调任务特定预测器。

Result: 实验表明，R-MTGB能有效隔离异常任务，促进知识迁移，降低预测误差，提升整体性能。

Conclusion: R-MTGB在多任务学习中表现出鲁棒性、适应性和可靠收敛性。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared
information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share
similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms
have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems,
primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and
iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for
learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve
tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which
do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate
the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose
Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that
explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB
structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning
shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with
regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This
architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks
while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method
integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing
robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers
knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task
individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These
results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB
in challenging MTL environments.

### [166] [Toward Improving fNIRS Classification: A Study on Activation Functions in Deep Neural Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11436)
*Behtom Adeli,John McLinden,Pankaj Pandey,Ming Shao,Yalda Shahriari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了不同激活函数在fNIRS分类任务中的表现，发现对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x）在某些架构中优于ReLU，并强调了激活函数选择对fNIRS数据特征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fNIRS领域中的非线性、低信噪比和信号变异性对模型准确性提出挑战，但激活函数对深度学习性能的影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用多种深度学习架构（如fNIRSNet、AbsoluteNet等）评估传统和领域特定激活函数，采用标准化预处理和训练参数。

Result: 对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x）在某些架构中优于ReLU；Modified Absolute Function（MAF）进一步验证了对称性的有效性。

Conclusion: 选择与fNIRS数据特征匹配的激活函数对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks,
particularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),
where nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability
poses significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of
activation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain
remains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current
literature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific
activation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep
learning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,
MDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset
recorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks
were trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent
training parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions
such as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly
used functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the
architecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was
conducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further
supporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance
gains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation
functions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.

*Hongming Tan,Ting Chen,Ruochong Jin,Wai Kin Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAIF的新型数据增强方法，用于改进iTransformer在多元时间序列预测中的性能，解决了其框架在时间依赖性和噪声方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iTransformer虽然有效，但其倒置框架在捕捉时间依赖性和处理非显著变量相关性时存在不足，因此需要一种专门的数据增强方法来优化其性能。

Method: 提出了两种DAIF策略：频率过滤（Frequency Filtering）和交叉变异修补（Cross-variation Patching），专门针对倒置框架设计。

Result: 实验表明，DAIF在多个数据集和倒置模型上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: DAIF是一种创新的实时数据增强方法，显著提升了iTransformer在多元时间序列预测中的表现。

Abstract: Currently, iTransformer is one of the most popular and effective models for
multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Thanks to its inverted framework,
iTransformer effectively captures multivariate correlation. However, the
inverted framework still has some limitations. It diminishes temporal
interdependency information, and introduces noise in cases of nonsignificant
variable correlation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel data
augmentation method on inverted framework, called DAIF. Unlike previous data
augmentation methods, DAIF stands out as the first real-time augmentation
specifically designed for the inverted framework in MTS forecasting. We first
define the structure of the inverted sequence-to-sequence framework, then
propose two different DAIF strategies, Frequency Filtering and Cross-variation
Patching to address the existing challenges of the inverted framework.
Experiments across multiple datasets and inverted models have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our DAIF.

*Yaoxian Dong,Yifan Gao,Haoyue Li,Yanfen Cui,Xin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRMR框架通过两阶段LLM方法提升直肠癌淋巴结转移评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI评估和现有AI模型在淋巴结转移诊断中表现有限且缺乏可解释性。

Method: LRMR采用两阶段方法：多模态LLM生成结构化报告，文本LLM进行患者间比较和风险排名。

Result: 在117例患者中，LRMR的AUC为0.7917，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段LLM框架为淋巴结转移评估提供了高效、可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node (LN) metastasis in rectal
cancer guides treatment decisions, yet conventional MRI evaluation based on
morphological criteria shows limited diagnostic performance. While some
artificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black
boxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these
models typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level
context. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven
Relational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic
task from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and
ranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal
large language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a
patient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological
features. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these
reports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based
on the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a
retrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under
the curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of
deep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies
confirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational
ranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant
performance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our
work demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning
through a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and
effective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了联邦学习（FL）在处理非线性、非平稳时间序列数据时的性能，发现FL在非线性数据分布下表现不如集中式方法，但适当的去趋势技术可提升FL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网（IoT）的发展，设备收集的时间序列数据具有非线性和非平稳性，传统集中式分析存在延迟和通信成本问题。FL作为一种分布式学习方法，需研究其在此类数据下的表现。

Method: 通过生成合成时间序列数据集（基于广义极值和对数正态分布），使用LSTM模型在集中式和FL设置下训练，并评估去趋势技术对真实数据集的影响。

Result: 实验表明：1）FL在非线性数据分布下表现较差；2）合适的去趋势技术能显著提升FL性能。

Conclusion: FL在处理复杂时间序列数据时需结合去趋势技术以优化性能，未来可进一步探索其他数据预处理方法。

Abstract: With advancements in computing and communication technologies, the Internet
of Things (IoT) has seen significant growth. IoT devices typically collect data
from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of
this data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is
centralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased
communication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective
alternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the
need to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and
environmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different
locations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.
Accurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is
crucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather
forecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction
accuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how
non-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized
extreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.
(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series
data influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated
several synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and
trained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL
approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world
datasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental
results show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when
dealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate
detrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different
data distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了四种基于TractOracle-RL的扩展方法，结合RL最新进展，评估其在五种扩散MRI数据集上的表现。结果表明，结合oracle的RL框架能提供稳健的追踪结果，并提出了一种新的RL训练方案IRT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统追踪算法存在假阳性问题，RL框架（如TractOracle-RL）通过结合解剖学先验表现出优势，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出了四种TractOracle-RL的扩展方法，并引入新的RL训练方案IRT，利用束过滤方法迭代优化oracle指导。

Result: 实验显示，结合oracle反馈的RL方法在准确性和解剖学有效性上显著优于传统技术。

Conclusion: 结合oracle的RL框架和IRT训练方案能显著提升追踪性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Tractography algorithms leverage diffusion MRI to reconstruct the fibrous
architecture of the brain's white matter. Among machine learning approaches,
reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
tractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects.
TractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by
incorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based
mechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original
TractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate
their performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results
demonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads
to robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or
dataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative
Reward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages
bundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout
training. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle
feedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms
of accuracy and anatomical validity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Wendland径向基函数（RBFs）的新型参数化激活函数，用于深度神经网络，解决了传统激活函数的局限性，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数（如ReLU、sigmoid和tanh）存在局限性，Wendland RBFs因其紧支撑性、平滑性和正定性，有望改进这些问题。

Method: 将Wendland RBFs与线性和指数项结合，提出增强型Wendland激活函数，具有可调局部性、改进的梯度传播和训练稳定性。

Result: 在合成任务（如正弦波逼近）和基准数据集（MNIST、Fashion-MNIST）上表现出竞争力，尤其在回归任务中准确率更高。

Conclusion: Wendland激活函数将经典RBF理论与现代深度学习结合，能缓解过拟合并提升泛化能力，未来可探索混合架构和领域适配。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parametric activation function based on
Wendland radial basis functions (RBFs) for deep neural networks. Wendland RBFs,
known for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in
approximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional
activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced
Wendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and
exponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation,
and enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its
mathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical
experiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark
datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results
show that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain
scenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational
efficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning,
suggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve
generalization through localized, smooth transformations. Future directions
include hybrid architectures and domain-specific adaptations.

TL;DR: LangevinFlow是一种基于物理先验的变分自编码器，用于建模神经群体的潜在动态结构和外部未观测影响，在合成和真实数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经群体表现出潜在动态结构，需要模型同时捕捉内部网络动态和外部未观测影响。

Method: 采用Langevin方程驱动的变分自编码器，结合物理先验（如惯性、阻尼、势函数和随机力），并使用局部耦合振荡器网络参数化势函数。

Result: 在合成数据和NLB基准测试中，模型在预测精度和神经元似然性上优于现有方法，同时解码行为指标表现优异。

Conclusion: LangevinFlow提供了一个灵活、高性能的框架，用于建模复杂神经动态及其未观测影响。

Abstract: Neural populations exhibit latent dynamical structures that drive
time-evolving spiking activities, motivating the search for models that capture
both intrinsic network dynamics and external unobserved influences. In this
work, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where
the time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin
equation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,
damping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent
both autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the
potential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled
oscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors
observed in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent
encoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent
space. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
synthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching
ground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model
achieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward
prediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or
surpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand
velocity. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, physics-inspired,
high-performing framework for modeling complex neural population dynamics and
their unobserved influences.

Motivation: 利用当前公众对自然语言处理（NLP）的兴趣，促进透明沟通，增强公众理解和支持研究。

Method: 通过分析已发表的NLP研究和新闻报道，提出三个主题的建议。

Result: 建议包括避免模糊术语、管理公众期望和强调伦理问题。

Conclusion: 透明沟通有助于提升公众对NLP的理解和支持研究的可持续性。

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by
rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This
attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP
researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience.
Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and
for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating
with a general audience about LLMs' capabilities and limitations. These
recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public
understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth,
and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research
and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples.
The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the
general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and
encourage support for research.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在法律领域中的实际性能及其原因，揭示公众可能高估其能力的现象。

Method: 通过欧洲专利资格考试的部分题目评估多种LLMs的性能，包括GPT系列、Anthropic、Deepseek和Llama-3等模型。

Result: OpenAI o1表现最佳（准确率0.82，F1分数0.81），但所有模型均未达到专业标准（准确率0.90）。模型输出对温度和提示词敏感，专家评估发现逻辑和格式问题。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs表现突出，但仍需改进逻辑一致性、多模态处理和提示适应性，以实现人类水平的专利能力。

Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual
applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are
underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs --
including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of
the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys.
OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web
Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama
3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for
the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have
passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold
of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are
regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level
performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3
Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the
textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each
model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the
answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert
judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt
wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future
work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive
prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the
outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might
overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a
virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific
limitations that need solutions.

Abstract: This shared task has aimed to assess pedagogical abilities of AI tutors
powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on evaluating the quality of
tutor responses aimed at student's mistake remediation within educational
dialogues. The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate
the AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification,
precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback
actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and
effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the
tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all
tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human
annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still
significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four
pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34
(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class
problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching
96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the
shared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their

Motivation: 现有研究多关注基于规则的心理健康聊天机器人，而缺乏对通用LLM聊天机器人的隐私安全问题的实证研究。

Method: 通过21次半结构化访谈，分析美国用户对LLM聊天机器人的隐私安全态度和误解。

Result: 用户误将LLM的共情能力等同于人类责任，且低估了情感披露的风险。

Conclusion: 提出“无形脆弱性”概念，并建议改进措施以更好地保护用户心理健康数据。

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly relying on large language model (LLM)-enabled
conversational agents for emotional support. While prior research has examined
privacy and security issues in chatbots specifically designed for mental health
purposes, these chatbots are overwhelmingly "rule-based" offerings that do not
leverage generative AI. Little empirical research currently measures users'
privacy and security concerns, attitudes, and expectations when using
general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots to manage and improve mental health.
Through 21 semi-structured interviews with U.S. participants, we identified
critical misconceptions and a general lack of risk awareness. Participants
conflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like
accountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these
chatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures
with a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of "intangible
vulnerability," where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued
compared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or
location-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard
user mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more
effectively.

Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities,
social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These
robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices.
However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic
features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a
more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data
linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their
homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and
concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in
the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19
semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy
concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy
controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants
worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about
the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the
data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants
expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and
context-appropriate functionality.

Conclusion: SZT是一种有效的防御机制，能够显著增强扩散模型对中毒攻击的抵抗力。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion
models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning
attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for
DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for
visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify
and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across
timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias
and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we
observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept
regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these
insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism
comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency
poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid
adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain
learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning
methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all
poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published
defenses. Code: www.github.com/JStyborski/Diff_Lab Data:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LaSM的层间缩放机制，用于增强多模态大语言模型（MLLM）GUI代理对弹出式环境注入攻击的防御能力，无需额外训练即可显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在面对恶意视觉元素（如弹出式攻击）时容易分心，导致不安全或错误操作，而现有防御方法成本高或效果不佳。

Method: 通过系统研究攻击如何改变GUI代理的注意力行为，发现层间注意力差异模式，并基于此提出LaSM机制，选择性放大关键层的注意力和MLP模块。

Result: 在12种弹出式扰动和4种模型骨干上的实验表明，LaSM显著提升了防御成功率，结合提示级警报后，鲁棒性可达98%以上。

Conclusion: 注意力错位是MLLM代理的核心漏洞，通过层间选择性调制可有效解决。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong decision-making abilities in
screen-based interaction tasks. However, they remain highly vulnerable to
pop-up-based environmental injection attacks, where malicious visual elements
divert model attention and lead to unsafe or incorrect actions. Existing
defense methods either require costly retraining or perform poorly under
inductive interference. In this work, we systematically study how such attacks
alter the attention behavior of GUI agents and uncover a layer-wise attention
divergence pattern between correct and incorrect outputs. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{LaSM}, a \textit{Layer-wise Scaling Mechanism} that
selectively amplifies attention and MLP modules in critical layers. LaSM
improves the alignment between model saliency and task-relevant regions without
additional training. Extensive experiments across 12 types of pop-up
perturbations and 4 different model backbones show that LaSM consistently
enhances the defense success rate. When combined with prompt-level alerts, LaSM
achieves over 98\% robustness even under strong inductive attacks. Our findings
reveal that attention misalignment is a core vulnerability in MLLM agents and
can be effectively addressed through selective layer-wise modulation.

Abstract: Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in
how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity
methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and
intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and
software tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling
adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in
autonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize
attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect
remains between theory and practical implementation.
  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to
bridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into
real-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and
coordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge
classical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static
payoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational
realities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel
solution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now
be modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.
  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and
cybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,
Bayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM
agents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed
reasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and
coordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,
and adaptive cyber systems.

Conclusion: 结合自适应信号处理和深度学习，为异构IoT网络提供了鲁棒且可扩展的异常检测方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge
in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly
detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model
known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks.
Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the
temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional
fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the
data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling
more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths
of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering
a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on
three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and
IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating
adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to
achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network
landscapes.

Abstract: Phishing remains a pervasive and growing threat, inflicting heavy economic
and reputational damage. While machine learning has been effective in real-time
detection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large,
high-quality datasets and benchmarks. In addition to poor-quality due to
challenges in data collection, existing datasets suffer from leakage and
unrealistic base rates, leading to overly optimistic performance results. In
this paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of
phishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public
datasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher
quality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data
points. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets
specifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage,
increasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base
rates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple
solution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We
believe the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic,
standardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing
detection. The datasets and benchmarks are available on Hugging Face
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/phreshphish/phreshphish).

Conclusion: NeuralMark提供了一种安全且广泛适用的神经网络水印解决方案，理论分析和实验验证均支持其有效性。

Abstract: As valuable digital assets, deep neural networks necessitate robust ownership
protection, positioning neural network watermarking (NNW) as a promising
solution. Among various NNW approaches, weight-based methods are favored for
their simplicity and practicality; however, they remain vulnerable to forging
and overwriting attacks. To address those challenges, we propose NeuralMark, a
robust method built around a hashed watermark filter. Specifically, we utilize
a hash function to generate an irreversible binary watermark from a secret key,
which is then used as a filter to select the model parameters for embedding.
This design cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed
watermark, providing a robust defense against both forging and overwriting
attacks. An average pooling is also incorporated to resist fine-tuning and
pruning attacks. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into various
neural network architectures, ensuring broad applicability. Theoretically, we
analyze its security boundary. Empirically, we verify its effectiveness and
robustness across 13 distinct Convolutional and Transformer architectures,
covering five image classification tasks and one text generation task. The
source codes are available at https://github.com/AIResearch-Group/NeuralMark.

Result: TaylorPODA在实证评估中表现优于基线方法，提供理论化且可视化友好的解释。

Conclusion: 该工作为不透明模型的可靠部署提供了理论支持更强的解释方法。

Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for
opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input
features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for
quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor
expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local
attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision",
"federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific
attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor
expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an
additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with
task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth
explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves
competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and
visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the
trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger
theoretical grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多流形聚类（MMC）需要处理潜在相交的高维流形，现有方法难以有效分离这些流形成分。

Method: 首先构建局部图，利用相邻单纯形间的二面角作为权重，计算无限路径距离（LAPD），并通过去噪处理分离流形成分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法对噪声、曲率和小交角具有鲁棒性，性能优于其他MMC算法，且实现了准线性计算复杂度。

Conclusion: LAPD方法在多流形聚类中表现出色，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This article introduces a novel, geometric approach for multi-manifold
clustering (MMC), i.e. for clustering a collection of potentially intersecting,
d-dimensional manifolds into the individual manifold components. We first
compute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between
adjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path
distances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices
which we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the
properties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate
denoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high
probability. We validate the proposed methodology with extensive numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. These experiments
demonstrate that the method is robust to noise, curvature, and small
intersection angle, and generally out-performs other MMC algorithms. In
addition, we provide a highly scalable implementation of the proposed
algorithm, which leverages approximation schemes for infinity path distance to
achieve quasi-linear computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏聚类标签，监督特征选择的正则化方法无法直接应用，因此需要一种无监督方法同时学习伪标签和选择判别特征。

Method: GOLFS算法通过流形学习结合局部几何结构和正则化自表示结合全局相关结构来选择判别特征。

Result: 模拟和实际数据应用表明，GOLFS在特征选择和聚类方面表现出色。

Conclusion: GOLFS通过综合利用全局和局部信息，提高了特征选择和聚类的准确性。

Abstract: It is important to identify the discriminative features for high dimensional
clustering. However, due to the lack of cluster labels, the regularization
methods developed for supervised feature selection can not be directly applied.
To learn the pseudo labels and select the discriminative features
simultaneously, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection method, named
GlObal and Local information combined Feature Selection (GOLFS), for high
dimensional clustering problems. The GOLFS algorithm combines both local
geometric structure via manifold learning and global correlation structure of
samples via regularized self-representation to select the discriminative
features. The combination improves the accuracy of both feature selection and
clustering by exploiting more comprehensive information. In addition, an
iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem and the
convergency is proved. Simulations and two real data applications demonstrate
the excellent finite-sample performance of GOLFS on both feature selection and
clustering.

Result: 实验显示模型在预测准确性、不确定性量化、可解释性和可扩展性上表现优越。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯框架为张量网络核机器提供了自动化和不确定性量化的优势。

Abstract: Tensor Network (TN) Kernel Machines speed up model learning by representing
parameters as low-rank TNs, reducing computation and memory use. However, most
TN-based Kernel methods are deterministic and ignore parameter uncertainty.
Further, they require manual tuning of model complexity hyperparameters like
tensor rank and feature dimensions, often through trial-and-error or
computationally costly methods like cross-validation. We propose Bayesian
Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses
sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer
model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature
dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction,
thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and
hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors.
Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a
mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that
applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS
algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic
counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational
cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our model in prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and scalability.

Conclusion: 建议使用适中的嵌入维度（如512、1024）、数据膨胀、弱增强和SVD，以平衡图连通性和标签错误，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art
performance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many
previous works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding
underlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a
default assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold
in practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the
strength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random
resized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling
error on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We
first reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on
downstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality
reduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on
original data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical
and empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a
double-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream
classification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation
graph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion
that we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in
our experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large
graph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.

Abstract: A methodology is developed, based on nonparametric Bayesian dictionary
learning, for joint space-time wind field data extrapolation and estimation of
related statistics by relying on limited/incomplete measurements. Specifically,
utilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization
problem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an
associated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field.
Compared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the
problem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First,
the Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in
the estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an
a priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is
done herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the
methodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of
high-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation
distances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind
engineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited
number of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by
considering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of
simulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint
wavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D
and time). The second pertains to the extrapolation of four-dimensional (3D and
time) boundary layer wind tunnel experimental data that exhibit significant
spatial variability and non-Gaussian characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准贝叶斯方法在识别线性时不变系统时，由于参数不可识别性导致复杂多模态后验分布，使得推断低效且不实用。

Method: 通过将LTI系统的规范形式嵌入贝叶斯框架，解决了参数不可识别性问题，同时保留了所有不变系统动态特性。

Result: 规范形式显著提高了计算效率，生成可解释且行为良好的后验分布，并在有限数据下提供稳健的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了参数识别问题，还支持结构感知先验，为贝叶斯与频率学派的渐近理论建立了联系。

Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system
identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting
complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We
solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the
Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal
parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer
functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while
resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful,
structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures
conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and
frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms.
Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over
standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational
efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide
robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.

Result: 初步实验结果展示了RTT测试的有效性。

Conclusion: RTT测试为评估AI代理的非语言行为提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose an approach to test embodied AI agents for interaction awareness
and believability, particularly in scenarios where humans push them to their
limits. Turing introduced the Imitation Game as a way to explore the question:
"Can machines think?" The Total Turing Test later expanded this concept beyond
purely verbal communication, incorporating perceptual and physical interaction.
Building on this, we propose a new guiding question: "Can machines react?" and
introduce the React to This (RTT) test for nonverbal behaviors, presenting
results from an initial experiment.

TL;DR: 该研究利用大型语言模型（LLM）开发了一个多智能体对话支持框架，用于检测家庭对话中的理想父母偏见和被压抑情绪，并生成共情且实用的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标常忽视家庭中的微妙心理动态，如理想父母偏见和被压抑情绪，本研究旨在通过技术支持改善家庭沟通。

Method: 构建了包含30个场景的日语亲子对话语料库，开发了基于LLM的多智能体框架，包括检测情绪和偏见的智能体，以及生成反馈的专家智能体。

Result: 系统能中等准确度检测被压抑情绪，生成的反馈在共情和实用性上评分高，模拟对话显示情绪表达和相互理解有所改善。

Conclusion: 该框架有望支持家庭互动的积极转变，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that
conventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental
expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional
expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,
often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is
difficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these
latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support
for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese
parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on
ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a
Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes
dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,
describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual
attributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these
outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert
agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable
feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show
that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate
accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.
Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited
signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the
framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family
interactions.

Motivation: 解决无人机群在复杂环境中的协同避碰问题，同时减少智能体间的交互和复杂信用分配的需求。

Method: 利用图像处理领域的知识设计奖励函数，将障碍物建模为二维场中的极值点，通过近似轮廓实现避碰。

Result: 框架能够高效训练大规模无人机群，适应复杂环境，并在实验中优于现有MARL算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机群协同避碰提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
cooperative collision avoidance of UAV swarms leveraging domain
knowledge-driven reward. The reward is derived from knowledge in the domain of
image processing, approximating contours on a two-dimensional field. By
modeling obstacles as maxima on the field, collisions are inherently avoided as
contours never go through peaks or intersect. Additionally, counters are smooth
and energy-efficient. Our framework enables training with large swarm sizes as
the agent interaction is minimized and the need for complex credit assignment
schemes or observation sharing mechanisms in state-of-the-art MARL approaches
are eliminated. Moreover, UAVs obtain the ability to adapt to complex
environments where contours may be non-viable or non-existent through intensive
training. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of
our framework against state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.

Motivation: 解决FER算法在自发表情识别和种族肤色偏见上的性能问题，揭示数据集收集实践对模型性能的影响。

Method: 审核两个先进FER数据集，随机采样并分类图像为自发或摆拍，同时观察肤色并测试模型对不同种族和肤色的预测表现。

Result: 发现数据集中存在大量摆拍图像，模型对非白人或深肤色人群更倾向于预测负面情绪，存在明显偏见。

Conclusion: 数据集质量和模型偏见问题需解决，以避免在真实应用中造成潜在伤害。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释CNN决策过程在高风险领域至关重要，但现有方法（如Grad-CAM）可能掩盖重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，结合Winsorization技术和用户可调阈值，跨层生成热图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM在可解释性和定位指标上优于Grad-CAM。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过多层级解释和人机交互控制，提升了AI的可信度。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 当前AI天气预报模型多基于Transformer架构，参数庞大且训练复杂，亟需更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用现代CNN架构，结合尺度不变设计和InceptionNeXt模块，针对地球系统数据优化。

Result: KAI-a在中等范围天气预报中性能媲美SOTA模型，且训练仅需12小时（单GPU）。

Conclusion: KAI-a展示了轻量级CNN模型在天气预报中的潜力，尤其在极端事件预测中表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

Conclusion: LVL和LGCL有效解决了TsDLI问题，在准确性和一致性之间取得了平衡，且LVL表现最优。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计实现了高性能和参数效率，为视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: SISRNet能有效捕捉细微异常，减轻数据偏差影响，生成临床准确的报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决了多模态场景表示中的模态冲突问题，实现了更高效和紧凑的表示。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our

TL;DR: RoMaP提出了一种新的局部3D高斯编辑框架，通过3D-GALP和正则化SDS损失解决了高斯溅射中局部编辑的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D神经表示和实例级编辑模型在实现精确局部3D编辑时面临多视角分割不一致和SDS损失模糊性的问题。

Method: RoMaP结合3D-GALP模块生成鲁棒的3D掩码，并引入正则化SDS损失（包括L1锚定损失和其他正则化器）来实现精确编辑。

Result: 实验表明RoMaP在重建和生成的高斯场景中实现了最先进的局部3D编辑效果。

Conclusion: RoMaP为3D高斯编辑提供了更鲁棒和灵活的部分级编辑能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Method: 采用关节角度建模，结合高阶傅里叶级数近似关节角度变化，并设计双向循环网络作为后处理模块优化HRNet的估计结果。

Result: 在花样滑冰和街舞等挑战性场景中，JAR方法优于现有HPE优化网络。

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的优化方法显著提升了HPE的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Motivation: 解决多模态情感识别中因传感器故障或隐私保护导致的不完整多模态问题，避免现有方法中不同模态组合训练梯度冲突的问题。

Method: 提出MCULoRA框架，包含模态组合感知低秩适应（MCLA）和动态参数微调（DPFT）模块，分别解耦模态组合的共享信息与独有特征，并动态调整训练比例。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，MCULoRA显著优于现有不完整多模态学习方法。

Conclusion: MCULoRA通过解耦和动态调整优化了不完整多模态学习，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

Motivation: GPR图像中的RSD识别依赖人工且效率低，现有深度学习方法受限于数据集质量和网络区分能力。

Method: 构建了一个高质量的3D GPR数据集，并提出基于YOLO模型的交叉验证策略，优化RSD识别。

Result: 在实地测试中，召回率超过98.6%，检测系统可减少约90%的人工工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为RSD自动识别提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

Result: VAR在非差分隐私适应中优于DM，但在差分隐私适应中表现较差。

Conclusion: VAR在非隐私任务中表现优异，但需进一步研究差分隐私适应方法。

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视场图像的压缩需求日益增长，传统方法难以保留细节，数据驱动方法泛化性差，INR虽有潜力但存在速度和压缩比问题。

Method: COLI框架采用NeRV技术，通过预训练-微调、混合精度训练和并行化目标加速收敛，并引入超压缩技术提升压缩比。

Result: 在两个医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩比显著提升，训练速度提高4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为高分辨率图像压缩提供了高效解决方案，平衡了速度、压缩比和图像质量。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: Transforming natural language into SQL queries (NL2SQL) is crucial for
data-driven business applications. Existing frameworks, trained on open-source

*Xinyuan Liu,Jiahui Chen,Bocheng Hu,Yu Sun,Xinyang Chen,Shaoxu Song*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: TableEG是一个利用大语言模型生成真实错误的框架，通过表格微调和三元组表示，生成与真实错误分布相似的合成错误，为错误检测和纠正任务提供基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量对数据驱动系统至关重要，但缺乏多样化的真实错误数据集限制了全面评估。手动标注耗时且不一致，因此探索合成错误生成作为替代方案。

Method: TableEG采用表格微调策略和三元组表示$(I, T, O)$，建模错误生成、检测和纠正任务，捕捉二维表格中的复杂依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，TableEG生成的错误在模式和分布相似性上优于基于规则的方法和未经微调的LLM生成错误，且性能指标与真实错误高度一致。

Conclusion: TableEG填补了合成与真实错误之间的差距，为后续错误检测和纠正任务提供了稳健的基准。

Abstract: Data quality remains an important challenge in data-driven systems, as errors
in tabular data can severely compromise downstream analytics and machine
learning performance. Although numerous error detection algorithms have been
proposed, the lack of diverse, real-world error datasets limits comprehensive
evaluation. Manual error annotation is both time-consuming and inconsistent,
motivating the exploration of synthetic error generation as an alternative. In
this work, we introduce TableEG, a framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate authentic errors. By employing a table fine-tuning
strategy and a triplet representation $(I, T, O)$ to model error generation,
detection, and correction tasks, TableEG captures the complex dependencies
inherent in two-dimensional tables. Trained on 12 real-world datasets spanning
10 diverse domains, TableEG ensures that the synthesized errors faithfully
reflect authentic error distributions. Experimental results indicate that
errors generated by TableEG exhibit superior pattern and distribution
similarity compared to both rule-based methods and LLM-generated errors without
fine-tuning. Furthermore, performance metrics on TableEG-generated errors
closely align with those on real-world errors across nearly all datasets and
detection algorithms, particularly for machine learning based detection
techniques. Overall, TableEG not only bridges the gap between synthetic and
real-world errors but also establishes a robust benchmark for subsequent error
detection and correction tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Meta Self-Refining框架通过元校正层修复语言模型管道中的竞争软约束问题，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型管道在面对竞争软约束时效率下降，导致无效回溯循环。

Method: 引入元校正层，通过监控执行历史检测振荡失败，调用元修复器LM分析状态并生成平衡指令。

Result: Meta Self-Refining成功修复回溯循环，提升语言模型程序的效率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了竞争约束问题，优化了语言模型的动态输出。

Abstract: Language Model (LM) pipelines can dynamically refine their outputs against
programmatic constraints. However, their effectiveness collapses when faced
with competing soft constraints, leading to inefficient backtracking loops
where satisfying one constraint violates another. We introduce Meta
Self-Refining, a framework that equips LM pipelines with a meta-corrective
layer to repair these competitions at runtime/inference-time. Our approach
monitors the pipeline's execution history to detect oscillatory failures. Upon
detection, it invokes a meta-repairer LM that analyzes the holistic state of
the backtracking attempts and synthesizes a strategic instruction to balance
the competing requirements. This self-repair instruction guides the original LM
out of a failing refining loop towards a successful output. Our results show
Meta Self-Refining can successfully repair these loops, leading to more
efficient LM programs.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了$	exttt{DroidCollection}$，一个包含多种编程语言和代码生成模型的开放数据集，并开发了$	exttt{DroidDetect}$检测器，展示了现有检测器的局限性及其改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成代码检测器在多样化的编程语言和领域中的泛化能力不足，且易受对抗性样本的干扰。

Method: 构建了$	exttt{DroidCollection}$数据集，并开发了基于多任务目标的$	exttt{DroidDetect}$检测器，采用度量学习和不确定性重采样优化训练。

Result: 现有检测器在多样化场景中表现不佳，但通过少量对抗性数据训练可显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: $	exttt{DroidDetect}$在多样化代码检测任务中表现优越，对抗性训练和优化方法有效提升了检测器的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most
extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code
detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages,
outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains.
Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI
co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade
detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite
of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over
$\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors'
performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming
languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate
that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output
distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this
problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial
data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and
uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly
noisy distributions.

TL;DR: ARPaCCino是一个结合LLM、RAG和工具验证的系统，用于自动化生成和验证Policy as Code规则，提升IaC环境中的合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy as Code（PaC）的采用受限于复杂的策略语言和配置错误的风险，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: ARPaCCino利用LLM、RAG和工具验证，从自然语言描述生成Rego规则，并验证和优化IaC配置。

Result: 实验证明ARPaCCino能生成正确策略，识别不合规基础设施，并进行修正，即使使用小型LLM。

Conclusion: ARPaCCino展示了基于RAG的代理架构在提升PaC工作流自动化、可靠性和可访问性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Policy as Code (PaC) is a paradigm that encodes security and compliance
policies into machine-readable formats, enabling automated enforcement in
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments. However, its adoption is hindered by
the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this
work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation
to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural
language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego
rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations
to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and
integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy
validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC
frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study
demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and
semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and
applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs.
Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the
automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.

Motivation: 现有SWE-bench数据集存在严重的数据污染问题（如解决方案泄漏和测试用例不足），限制了大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中的评估效果。

Method: 提出SWE-MERA，通过自动化收集真实GitHub问题并实施严格质量验证，构建动态更新的基准测试。

Result: 已收集约10,000个潜在任务（当前300个样本），并使用Aider编码代理验证了其在最新LLMs中的区分能力。

Conclusion: SWE-MERA有效解决了数据污染问题，为LLMs在软件工程中的评估提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering
has revealed critical limitations in existing benchmarks, particularly the
widely used SWE-bench dataset. Recent studies have uncovered severe data
contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches
involve direct solution leakage and 31.08\% pass due to inadequate test cases.
We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to
address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of
real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach
implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing
contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300
samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding agent
demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We report
performance across a dozen recent LLMs evaluated on tasks collected between

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在代码生成和补全任务中表现优异，但缺乏深层语义理解能力，导致在调试和优化等任务中表现不佳。

Method: 通过在大规模数据集上微调模型，专门针对代码理解任务进行优化，以提升语义理解能力。

Result: 实验显示微调后模型性能显著提升，如QWQ-32B模型准确率从70%提升至83.47%，Codestral-22B模型在主观评分任务中达到87.66%的准确率。

Conclusion: 微调能有效提升大语言模型的代码理解能力，尤其是在需要深层语义理解的任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like
code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large
amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next
Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns
in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the
ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the
reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To
address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code
comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more
robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of
varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess
semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In
particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe
that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks.
The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy
increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across
other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability.
Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest
micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.

TL;DR: CodeAssistBench (CAB) 是一个新的基准框架，用于评估多轮编程辅助在真实环境中的表现，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如InfiBench和StackEval）局限于单轮交互和孤立环境，无法反映真实项目环境中的编程辅助需求。

Method: CAB 通过自动从GitHub问题生成可扩展数据集，并利用容器化代码库和模拟用户进行评估。

Result: 测试集包含3,286个真实编程问题，覆盖7种语言。评估显示，主流LLM在Stack Overflow上表现良好（70-83%成功率），但在CAB中仅解决16.49%的问题。

Conclusion: CAB 揭示了LLM在复杂项目环境中的能力局限，强调了真实编程辅助的挑战。

Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models have transformed
software development, yet most benchmarks focus narrowly on code generation
tasks. Recent efforts like InfiBench and StackEval attempt to address this gap
using Stack Overflow data but remain limited to single-turn interactions in
isolated contexts, require significant manual curation, and fail to represent
complete project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first
benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in
realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases.
Unlike existing programming Q&A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates
scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable
parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages),
and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then
evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments
with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of
3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven
programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading
LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack
Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49%
of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing
assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone
questions.

TL;DR: 论文提出SENSOR工具和GRACE模型，用于自动分类社交媒体用户评论中的隐私相关功能请求和错误报告，提升开发者处理隐私问题的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体用户评论数量庞大且复杂，手动识别隐私相关问题效率低下，现有工具缺乏对隐私相关功能请求和错误报告的分类。

Method: 开发SENSOR工具和GRACE模型（基于GRU、CBOW和注意力机制），分析16000条用户评论并手动标注，训练分类模型。

Result: GRACE模型表现最佳（宏F1分数0.9434，宏ROC-AUC 0.9934，准确率95.10%），SENSOR工具能有效辅助开发者。

Conclusion: SENSOR工具和GRACE模型能高效分类隐私相关评论，提升用户隐私保护和信任。

Abstract: The widespread use of social media applications has raised significant
privacy concerns, often highlighted in user reviews. These reviews also provide
developers with valuable insights into improving apps by addressing issues and
introducing better features. However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of
reviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related
concerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software
utilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant,
privacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine
learning. Notably, there is a lack of focus on classifying reviews specifically
as privacy-related feature requests, privacy-related bug reports, or
privacy-irrelevant. This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated
online annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user
reviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,
this paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with
CBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words
(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven
popular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,
WhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were
analyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's
Kappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement
for training machine learning models. Among the models tested, GRACE
demonstrated the best performance (macro F1-score: 0.9434, macro ROC-AUC:
0.9934, and accuracy: 95.10%) despite class imbalance. SENSOR demonstrates
significant potential to assist developers with extracting and addressing
privacy-related feature requests or bug reports from user reviews, enhancing
user privacy and trust.

Conclusion: 自适应AI对话代理有望通过定制化支持和高效开发周期彻底改变软件开发。

Abstract: Conversational agents, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, have become
essential in software development, boosting productivity, collaboration, and
automating various tasks. This paper examines the role of adaptive AI-powered
conversational agents in software development, highlighting their ability to
offer dynamic, context-aware assistance to developers. Unlike traditional
rule-based systems, adaptive AI agents use machine learning and natural
language processing to learn from interactions and improve over time, providing
more personalized and responsive help. We look at how these tools have evolved
from simple query-based systems to advanced AI-driven solutions like GitHub
Copilot and Microsoft Teams bots. We also explore the challenges of integrating
adaptive AI into software development processes. The study aims to assess the
benefits and limitations of these systems, address concerns like data privacy
and ethical issues, and offer insights into their future use in the field.
Ultimately, adaptive AI chatbots have great potential to revolutionize software
development by delivering real-time, customized support and enhancing the
efficiency of development cycles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于网络理论的视角，强调通过有向交易网络检测预定义的洗钱模式，而非传统的异常实体检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反洗钱（AML）系统误判了洗钱的本质，洗钱行为通常是故意、重复且隐藏在常规行为中的，而非统计异常。

Method: 引入行为一致性作为洗钱活动的核心特征，通过子图结构捕捉语义和功能角色，而非仅依赖几何特征。

Result: 提出模式脆弱性概念，即洗钱模式对小属性变化的敏感性，同时保持语义鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 洗钱检测应基于行为本质的保留，而非统计异常，这一理念对AML系统的建模和网络分析有重要影响。

Abstract: Conventional anti-money laundering (AML) systems predominantly focus on
identifying anomalous entities or transactions, flagging them for manual
investigation based on statistical deviation or suspicious behavior. This
paradigm, however, misconstrues the true nature of money laundering, which is
rarely anomalous but often deliberate, repeated, and concealed within
consistent behavioral routines. In this paper, we challenge the entity-centric
approach and propose a network-theoretic perspective that emphasizes detecting
predefined laundering patterns across directed transaction networks. We
introduce the notion of behavioral consistency as the core trait of laundering
activity, and argue that such patterns are better captured through subgraph
structures expressing semantic and functional roles - not solely geometry.
Crucially, we explore the concept of pattern fragility: the sensitivity of
laundering patterns to small attribute changes and, conversely, their semantic
robustness even under drastic topological transformations. We claim that
laundering detection should not hinge on statistical outliers, but on
preservation of behavioral essence, and propose a reconceptualization of
pattern similarity grounded in this insight. This philosophical and practical
shift has implications for how AML systems model, scan, and interpret networks
in the fight against financial crime.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations by
analyzing deviations between a user's original speech and their voice-cloned

maximal acoustic deviation between the original and cloned utterances indicate
potential mispronunciations. Our method leverages recent advances in voice
cloning to generate a synthetic version of the user's voice with proper
pronunciation, then performs frame-by-frame comparisons to identify problematic
segments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
in pinpointing specific pronunciation errors without requiring predefined
phonetic rules or extensive training data for each target language.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate leveraging cross-attention control for
efficient audio editing within auto-regressive models. Inspired by image
editing methodologies, we develop a Prompt-to-Prompt-like approach that guides
edits through cross and self-attention mechanisms. Integrating a
diffusion-based strategy, influenced by Auffusion, we extend the model's
functionality to support refinement edits, establishing a baseline for
prompt-guided audio editing. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach
by incorporating MUSICGEN, a pre-trained frozen auto-regressive model, and
propose three editing mechanisms, based on Replacement, Reweighting, and
Refinement of the attention scores. We employ commonly-used music-specific
evaluation metrics and a human study, to gauge time-varying controllability,
adherence to global text cues, and overall audio realism. The automatic and
human evaluations indicate that the proposed combination of prompt-to-prompt
guidance with autoregressive generation models significantly outperforms the
diffusion-based baseline in terms of melody, dynamics, and tempo of the
generated audio. Our code is available at https://github.com/billsioros/EditGen

Motivation: 工业过程优化常因缺乏明确的数学模型而受限，本研究旨在通过数据驱动方法解决这一问题。

Method: 使用机器学习构建代理模型，结合改进的差分进化算法（Data-Driven Differential Evolution with Multi-Level Penalty Functions and Surrogate Models）优化工业过程。

Result: 在轮胎制造中，该方法减少了65%的初始化和设置时间，并显著降低了废料。

Conclusion: 数据驱动建模与元启发式优化结合，为缺乏显式模型的工业过程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The optimization of industrial processes remains a critical challenge,
particularly when no mathematical formulation of objective functions or
constraints is available. This study addresses this issue by proposing a
surrogate-based, data-driven methodology for optimizing complex real-world
manufacturing systems using only historical process data. Machine learning
models are employed to approximate system behavior and construct surrogate
models, which are integrated into a tailored metaheuristic approach:
Data-Driven Differential Evolution with Multi-Level Penalty Functions and
Surrogate Models, an adapted version of Differential Evolution suited to the
characteristics of the studied process. The methodology is applied to an
extrusion process in the tire manufacturing industry, with the goal of
optimizing initialization parameters to reduce waste and production time.
Results show that the surrogate-based optimization approach outperforms
historical best configurations, achieving a 65\% reduction in initialization
and setup time, while also significantly minimizing material waste. These
findings highlight the potential of combining data-driven modeling and
metaheuristic optimization for industrial processes where explicit formulations
are unavailable.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate divergence measure is a critical aspect of machine
learning, as it directly impacts model performance. Among the most widely used,
we find the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, originally introduced in kinetic
theory as a measure of relative entropy between probability distributions. Just
as in machine learning, the ability to quantify the proximity of probability
distributions plays a central role in kinetic theory. In this paper, we present
a comparative review of divergence measures rooted in kinetic theory,
highlighting their theoretical foundations and exploring their potential
applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: SPICEAssistant框架通过提供工具接口，显著提升LLM在SMPS设计中的性能，比GPT-4o表现提升38%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在电子设计自动化（EDA）中的应用潜力，特别是在SMPS设计中的适应性和理解能力。

Method: 提出SPICEAssistant框架，为LLM提供与SPICE模拟器交互的工具，支持多步骤设计过程。

Result: 通过256个问题的基准测试，显示模拟反馈显著提升LLM性能，迭代次数增加效果更佳。

Conclusion: SPICEAssistant框架有效解决了LLM在SMPS设计中的挑战，性能显著优于独立LLM。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) show high performance across a
wide range of tasks in many domains of science. In the field of electronic
design automation (EDA), it is yet to be determined to what extent they are
capable to understand, adapt, and dimension electronic circuits. This paper
focuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design
on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Particular challenges for LLMs in this
context include their limited ability to interpret results from key simulation
tools like SPICE and the multi-step design process. To address these
challenges, we suggest SPICEAssistant, a framework that provides a broad
selection of tools to an LLM. The tools serve as an interface to SPICE,
allowing the LLM to interact flexibly with the simulator to estimate the impact
of its modifications to the circuit. To evaluate the performance of
SPICEAssistant, we defined a benchmark consisting of 256 questions testing the
ability to adapt circuit netlists to fulfil different SMPS design tasks. The
benchmarking results show that simulation feedback effectively improves SMPS
design capabilities of LLMs. An increasing number of simulation iterations
leads to enhanced performance. The SPICEAssistant framework significantly
outperforms the standalone LLM GPT-4o on the benchmark by approximately 38%.

TL;DR: Elk是一个深度学习编译器框架，旨在优化ICCA芯片的效率，通过平衡计算、通信和I/O性能，实现接近理想的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型需求的增长，ICCA芯片需要高效处理计算、通信和I/O之间的权衡问题。

Method: Elk通过可配置参数构建全局权衡空间，采用新的调度策略和内存分配算法，生成优化的执行计划。

Result: Elk在ICCA芯片上实现了平均94%的理想性能，支持大型DL模型，并可用于芯片设计空间探索。

Conclusion: Elk有效提升了ICCA芯片的效率，并为未来芯片开发提供了设计探索能力。

Abstract: To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are
employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency
interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to
explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a
fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication
(inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access).
  In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the
efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance
factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into
configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler.
To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk
employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip
memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans
that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the
efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip
IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different
interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline
performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large
DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture
design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.

TL;DR: 论文提出FSA架构，通过改进的脉动阵列设计，使FlashAttention算法完全在单一脉动阵列中运行，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脉动阵列在执行FlashAttention时因频繁数据交换和非矩阵操作导致利用率低，性能受限。

Method: 提出FSA架构，采用SystolicAttention调度算法，实现细粒度元素级重叠操作。

Result: FSA在注意力FLOPs/s利用率上比AWS NeuronCore-v2和Google TPUv5e分别高1.77倍和4.83倍，面积开销仅约10%。

Conclusion: FSA有效解决了FlashAttention在脉动阵列上的执行问题，显著提升了性能和利用率。

Abstract: Transformer models rely heavily on scaled dot-product attention (SDPA),
typically implemented using the FlashAttention algorithm. However, current
systolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing
FlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for
consecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention
requires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.
  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units
result in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the
fact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not
well-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix
multiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register
file and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array
architecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely
within a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.
At the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps
FlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise
overlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the
original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.
  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against
state-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves
1.77x and 4.83x higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS
NeuronCore-v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only about 10% area
overhead.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在金融决策中如何模拟人类行为，并揭示其潜在的文化和训练影响。

Method: 向七个领先的LLMs（包括GPT系列、Gemini 2.0 Flash和DeepSeek R1）提出金融决策问题，并与来自53个国家的人类回答进行比较。

Result: 1. LLMs表现出风险中性决策模式；2. 在时间权衡问题上偶尔与规范推理不一致；3. LLMs的回答与坦桑尼亚参与者最相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在金融决策中表现出与人类相似的行为，但也存在不一致性，反映了其训练和文化背景的影响。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) approach financial
decision-making by systematically comparing their responses to those of human
participants across the globe. We posed a set of commonly used financial
decision-making questions to seven leading LLMs, including five models from the
GPT series(GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o1, o3-mini), Gemini 2.0 Flash, and DeepSeek R1. We
then compared their outputs to human responses drawn from a dataset covering 53
nations. Our analysis reveals three main results. First, LLMs generally exhibit
a risk-neutral decision-making pattern, favoring choices aligned with expected
value calculations when faced with lottery-type questions. Second, when
evaluating trade-offs between present and future, LLMs occasionally produce
responses that appear inconsistent with normative reasoning. Third, when we
examine cross-national similarities, we find that the LLMs' aggregate responses
most closely resemble those of participants from Tanzania. These findings
contribute to the understanding of how LLMs emulate human-like decision
behaviors and highlight potential cultural and training influences embedded
within their outputs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“测量学习”的范式，通过非线性期望建模模糊性，并定义了基于神经网络的BSDE解法的神经期望算子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统BSDE理论中全局Lipschitz条件的限制，并将其应用于机器学习领域。

Method: 利用神经网络参数化BSDE的驱动，并证明其在局部Lipschitz条件和二次增长条件下的适定性。

Result: 理论适用于常见神经网络架构（如ReLU激活函数），并扩展到完全耦合的前向-后向SDE系统和大型交互粒子系统的渐近分析。

Conclusion: 为数据驱动的模糊性建模提供了数学基础框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textbf{Measure Learning}, a paradigm for modeling
ambiguity via non-linear expectations. We define Neural Expectation Operators
as solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) whose
drivers are parameterized by neural networks. The main mathematical
contribution is a rigorous well-posedness theorem for BSDEs whose drivers
satisfy a local Lipschitz condition in the state variable $y$ and quadratic
growth in its martingale component $z$. This result circumvents the classical
global Lipschitz assumption, is applicable to common neural network
architectures (e.g., with ReLU activations), and holds for exponentially
integrable terminal data, which is the sharp condition for this setting. Our
primary innovation is to build a constructive bridge between the abstract, and
often restrictive, assumptions of the deep theory of quadratic BSDEs and the
world of machine learning, demonstrating that these conditions can be met by
concrete, verifiable neural network designs. We provide constructive methods
for enforcing key axiomatic properties, such as convexity, by architectural
design. The theory is extended to the analysis of fully coupled
Forward-Backward SDE systems and to the asymptotic analysis of large
interacting particle systems, for which we establish both a Law of Large
Numbers (propagation of chaos) and a Central Limit Theorem. This work provides
the foundational mathematical framework for data-driven modeling under
ambiguity.

Motivation: 研究动机是改进现有的纤维束分析方法，以更精确地检测群体间白质纤维束的局部差异。

Method: 方法包括创建图谱引导的纤维束分割模板和提出一种非参数置换检验方法，用于群体比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，AGFS-Tractometry在合成数据和真实数据中均表现出更高的敏感性和特异性，能检测到更多解剖学上一致的显著差异区域。

Conclusion: 结论是AGFS-Tractometry能够有效检测细微或空间局部的白质群体差异，相关工具已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo
mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an
advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to
investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber
tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract
differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this
study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely
AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation
testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.
There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel
atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,
along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a
novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable
simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for
multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets
with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry
with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract
Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the
proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in
detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,
AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which
are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these
demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially
localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and
related code are available at:

Result: 在16个基准测试中优于或匹配70种传统和深度学习方法，提升了蛋白质-蛋白质亲和力预测和抗原-抗体结合相关性。

Conclusion: BioScore为复杂生物分子系统的结构评估提供了稳健且通用的框架。

Abstract: Structural assessment of biomolecular complexes is vital for translating
molecular models into functional insights, shaping our understanding of biology
and aiding drug discovery. However, current structure-based scoring functions
often lack generalizability across diverse biomolecular systems. We present
BioScore, a foundational scoring function that addresses key challenges -- data
sparsity, cross-system representation, and task compatibility -- through a
dual-scale geometric graph learning framework with tailored modules for
structure assessment and affinity prediction. BioScore supports a wide range of
tasks, including affinity prediction, conformation ranking, and structure-based
virtual screening. Evaluated on 16 benchmarks spanning proteins, nucleic acids,
small molecules, and carbohydrates, BioScore consistently outperforms or
matches 70 traditional and deep learning methods. Our newly proposed PPI
Benchmark further enables comprehensive evaluation of protein-protein complex
scoring. BioScore demonstrates broad applicability: (1) pretraining on
mixed-structure data boosts protein-protein affinity prediction by up to 40%
and antigen-antibody binding correlation by over 90%; (2) cross-system
generalizability enables zero- and few-shot prediction with up to 71%
correlation gain; and (3) its unified representation captures chemically
challenging systems such as cyclic peptides, improving affinity prediction by
over 60%. BioScore establishes a robust and generalizable framework for
structural assessment across complex biomolecular landscapes.

Abstract: With increasing wastewater rates, achieving energy-neutral purification is
challenging. We introduce a coral-reef-inspired Swarm Interaction Network for
carbon-neutral wastewater treatment, combining morphogenetic abstraction with
multi-task carbon awareness. Scalability stems from linear token complexity,
mitigating the energy-removal problem. Compared with seven baselines, our

demonstrates robustness under sensor drift. Field scenarios--insular lagoons,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数对深度神经网络的反向传播和表达能力至关重要，Tangma通过可学习参数调整神经元激活行为，提升训练稳定性和效率。

Method: Tangma结合双曲正切的平滑性和两个可学习参数（α调整拐点，γ增加线性），在MNIST和CIFAR-10上测试并与ReLU、Swish和GELU对比。

Result: 在MNIST上，Tangma验证准确率最高（99.09%），损失最低；在CIFAR-10上，准确率78.15%，表现优于其他激活函数且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Tangma在标准视觉任务中表现优异，可学习设计为更大模型（如图像识别或语言建模）提供更多控制，有望广泛应用。

Abstract: Activation functions are key to effective backpropagation and expressiveness
in deep neural networks. This work introduces Tangma, a new activation function
that combines the smooth shape of the hyperbolic tangent with two learnable
parameters: $\alpha$, which shifts the curve's inflection point to adjust
neuron activation, and $\gamma$, which adds linearity to preserve weak
gradients and improve training stability. Tangma was evaluated on MNIST and
CIFAR-10 using custom networks composed of convolutional and linear layers, and
compared against ReLU, Swish, and GELU. On MNIST, Tangma achieved the highest
validation accuracy of 99.09% and the lowest validation loss, demonstrating
faster and more stable convergence than the baselines. On CIFAR-10, Tangma
reached a top validation accuracy of 78.15%, outperforming all other activation
functions while maintaining a competitive training loss. Tangma also showed
improved training efficiency, with lower average epoch runtimes compared to
Swish and GELU. These results suggest that Tangma performs well on standard
vision tasks and enables reliable, efficient training. Its learnable design
gives more control over activation behavior, which may benefit larger models in
tasks such as image recognition or language modeling.

Abstract: The complete connectome of the Drosophila larva brain offers a unique
opportunity to investigate whether biologically evolved circuits can support
artificial intelligence. We convert this wiring diagram into a Biological
Processing Unit (BPU), a fixed recurrent network derived directly from synaptic
connectivity. Despite its modest size 3,000 neurons and 65,000 weights between
them), the unmodified BPU achieves 98% accuracy on MNIST and 58% on CIFAR-10,
surpassing size-matched MLPs. Scaling the BPU via structured connectome
expansions further improves CIFAR-10 performance, while modality-specific
ablations reveal the uneven contributions of different sensory subsystems. On
the ChessBench dataset, a lightweight GNN-BPU model trained on only 10,000
games achieves 60% move accuracy, nearly 10x better than any size transformer.
Moreover, CNN-BPU models with ~2M parameters outperform parameter-matched
Transformers, and with a depth-6 minimax search at inference, reach 91.7%
accuracy, exceeding even a 9M-parameter Transformer baseline. These results
demonstrate the potential of biofidelic neural architectures to support complex
cognitive tasks and motivate scaling to larger and more intelligent connectomes

Conclusion: LiLM-RDB-SFC方法显著提升SFC管理效率，FLAN-T5是更优的语言模型选择。

Abstract: Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual
Network Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
environments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for
dynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and
fixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly
under unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a
novel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational
Database (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient
SFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and
Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5
(FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to
SFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate
that FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to
0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time
(2h 2min compared to 2h 38min). Moreover, when compared to the large language
model SQLCoder, FLAN-T5 matches the accuracy of SQLCoder while cutting
processing time by 96% (SQLCoder: 54 h 43 min; FLAN-T5: 2 h 2 min).

growth of new innovative methods. The study presented in this work makes use of
machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in
terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to
adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for
industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and
long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi
setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction
accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery
ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although
slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU
usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded

architectures to perform phase picking, association, and event location
simultaneously over rolling windows, making it suitable for both playback and
near-real-time monitoring. As part of the global strategy to reduce carbon
emissions within the broader context of a green-energy transition, there has
been growing interest in exploiting enhanced geothermal systems. Tested in the
complex geothermal area of Iceland's Hengill region using open-access data from
a temporary experiment, our model was trained and validated using both manually
revised and automatic seismic catalogs. Results showed a significant increase
in event detection compared to previously published automatic systems and
reference catalogs, including a $4 M_w$ seismic sequence in December 2018 and a
single-day sequence in February 2019. Our method reduces false events,
minimizes manual oversight, and decreases the need for extensive tuning of

Conclusion: 核方法提供了建模灵活性，同时保留了闭式解，是梯度优化的替代方案。

Abstract: In this article, we develop a kernel-based framework for constructing
dynamic, pathdependent trading strategies under a mean-variance optimisation
criterion. Building on the theoretical results of (Muca Cirone and Salvi,
2025), we parameterise trading strategies as functions in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling a flexible and non-Markovian approach to optimal
portfolio problems. We compare this with the signature-based framework of
(Futter, Horvath, Wiese, 2023) and demonstrate that both significantly
outperform classical Markovian methods when the asset dynamics or predictive
signals exhibit temporal dependencies for both synthetic and market-data
examples. Using kernels in this context provides significant modelling
flexibility, as the choice of feature embedding can range from randomised
signatures to the final layers of neural network architectures. Crucially, our
framework retains closed-form solutions and provides an alternative to
gradient-based optimisation.

*Yuchen He,Zhehan Lei,Jianan Shao,Chihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了从具有特定密度分布的采样问题，通过加强平滑性条件，显著降低了采样算法的查询复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在特定平滑性和矩假设下，如何优化采样算法的查询复杂度，以解决高维空间中的采样难题。

Method: 在加强的平滑性条件（1*）和矩假设（2）下，提出了一种多项式查询复杂度的采样算法。

Result: 在条件（1*）和（2）下，采样查询复杂度可降至多项式级别，显著优于之前的准多项式复杂度算法。

Conclusion: 加强平滑性条件可以显著降低采样算法的查询复杂度，并在特定应用中改进了Poincaré常数的估计。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density
$\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with
query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard
assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling
from such distributions is at least
$\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired
accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be
arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers
(see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23))
strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of
sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot
\left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial
in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and
$M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query
complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the
seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead
to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger
moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the
Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an
application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e
constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.

Abstract: We propose a framework for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms
in variational quantum Monte Carlo, drawing on geometric insights into the
corresponding function space. The framework translates infinite-dimensional
optimization dynamics into tractable parameter-space algorithms through a
Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz. This
perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and
Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space
algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically
principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical
experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate
estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in
condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.

Result: 证明两种方法在$O(\epsilon^{-2})$迭代内收敛，数值实验验证了在PDE和深度学习中的高效性。

Conclusion: 两种算法在噪声环境下高效，适用于多种应用场景，理论框架为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are
presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order
information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a
hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a
domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz
decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm
for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common
theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which
covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods
need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to
compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the
bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on
applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training,
illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.

Result: Cross-ViT表现最佳，准确率88.25%，召回率99.42%，优于其他模型。

Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a
critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This
study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and
state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection
using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from
conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning
architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet,
DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT,
Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856
pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the
Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and
99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that
architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size,
with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also
addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training
requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical
diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CLS-DM的模型，通过跨模态特征对比学习，从2D X射线图像中提取3D信息，并在潜在空间中对齐模态，显著提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CT重建方法的时间消耗和辐射暴露问题，以及现有扩散模型在2D与3D模态潜在空间对齐上的不足。

Method: 提出CLS-DM模型，结合跨模态特征对比学习，实现2D X射线图像到3D CT的潜在空间对齐。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和CTSpine1K数据集上，CLS-DM在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于现有生成模型。

Conclusion: CLS-DM不仅提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果，还可推广到其他跨模态转换任务，如文本到图像合成。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

Motivation: 解决腹部CT图像中肝脏和肿瘤分割的挑战，如复杂解剖结构、肿瘤外观多变和标注数据有限。

Method: 结合双曲卷积、小波分解模块、突触可塑性机制和隐式神经表示，并引入不确定性感知和轻量级时间注意力。

Result: 在LiTS数据集上达到93.26% Dice分数和0.72 mm ASSD，在3D-IRCADb-01数据集上表现优异，验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: HANS-Net在肝脏和肿瘤分割中表现出高效、准确和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the
3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of
1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different
datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in
providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor
segmentation.

Conclusion: U-RWKV为资源受限环境提供了一种高效的医疗图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet
high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in
resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often
suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their
ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,
a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)
architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)
computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the
Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan
mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional
bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational
efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature
extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic
relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,
offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging
technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Motion Primitives（DMPs）在捕捉复杂周期性行为和任务间插值方面存在局限性，限制了其在实际任务（如运动和节奏工具使用）中的应用。

Method: 引入OSMPs框架，结合学习的微分同胚编码器和超临界Hopf分岔，确保轨道稳定性和横向收缩，并通过任务条件化编码器实现多任务表示。

Result: 在多种机器人平台上验证了OSMPs的优越性，包括协作臂、软机械手和仿生机器人，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: OSMPs框架有效解决了DMPs的局限性，提供了更灵活和稳定的周期性运动学习方法。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring
complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with
fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability
and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic
behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between
different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,
excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and
rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion
Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder
with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate
acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal
guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by
conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned
policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot
generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We
validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world
experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative
arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot -
demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

multi-metabolite quantification of glutamate, mobile proteins, semisolid, and
mobile macromolecules in an acute MPTP
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. The quantitative
parameter maps are in general agreement with the histology and MR spectroscopy,
and demonstrate that semisolid magnetization transfer (MT), amide, and
aliphatic relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) proton volume fractions may
serve as PD biomarkers.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration
has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for
rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses.
Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo,
face significant computational challenges when dealing with the
high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in
gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of
simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a
focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as
normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive
overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based
inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio
estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency
models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse
gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter
estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and
conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed
improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their
model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to
their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of
conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter
spaces and noise conditions.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered omni models
to act as voice assistants capable of understanding spoken dialogues. These
models can process multimodal inputs beyond text, such as speech and visual
data, enabling more context-aware interactions. However, current benchmarks
fall short in comprehensively evaluating how well these models generate
context-aware responses, particularly when it comes to implicitly understanding
fine-grained speech characteristics, such as pitch, emotion, timbre, and volume
or the environmental acoustic context such as background sounds. Additionally,
they inadequately assess the ability of models to align paralinguistic cues
with complementary visual signals to inform their responses. To address these
gaps, we introduce MultiVox, the first omni voice assistant benchmark designed
to evaluate the ability of voice assistants to integrate spoken and visual cues
including paralinguistic speech features for truly multimodal understanding.
Specifically, MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated and recorded speech
dialogues that encompass diverse paralinguistic features and a range of visual
cues such as images and videos. Our evaluation on 9 state-of-the-art models
reveals that, although humans excel at these tasks, current models consistently
struggle to produce contextually grounded responses.

than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily
find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their
intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to
maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and
identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven
background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in
real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background
spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that
periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental
conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its
environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while
maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world
datasets.

### [269] [Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634)
*Thomas Feys,Liesbet Van der Perre,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文研究了大规模MIMO系统中粗量化下行链路的非线性预编码问题，提出了一种基于图神经网络的解决方案，显著提高了可实现的和速率并降低了DAC功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模MIMO系统中射频链数量、载波频率和带宽的增加，DAC的硬件复杂性和功耗成为瓶颈，需要解决粗量化下的预编码问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的自监督训练方法，直接输出预编码量化向量，并通过Gumbel-softmax梯度估计解决目标函数的不可微问题。

Result: 在粗量化条件下，该方法显著提高了可实现的和速率，例如在单用户情况下，使用1位DAC即可达到与3位DAC的MRT相同的和速率，降低了DAC功耗。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低DAC功耗方面效果显著，但在高带宽下需权衡数字信号处理的功耗增加。未考虑的间接效应可能进一步降低功耗。

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency
chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of
hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding
for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard
nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly
outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the
intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by
directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability
of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC
functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is
proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum
rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the
proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the
DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs
respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal
processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in
overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for
baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for
higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power
consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other
components, are not considered in this analysis.

*Sehyun Ryu,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信道预测的参考信号分配方法（CPRS），通过联合优化信道预测和DM-RS分配，在不依赖CSI反馈的情况下提升数据吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G及超5G网络中，大规模MIMO系统的天线数量增加导致CSI反馈需求激增，现有研究主要集中在CSI压缩和预测，而参考信号分配问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出CPRS方法，结合ViViT/CNN架构，将CSI矩阵视为时序图像数据，优化信道预测和DM-RS分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在吞吐量上比基准策略提升了36.60%。

Conclusion: CPRS方法为动态环境中的高效自适应传输提供了可行方案，填补了参考信号分配研究的空白。

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling
efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results
using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed
method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于玩家可选动作数量庞大，需要开发查询次数低于动作数量的验证协议，以提高效率。

Result: 验证协议在平滑策略下有效，查询复杂度低于学习，且应用于标准形式游戏时可验证近似强平滑纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 验证协议在多臂老虎机和标准形式游戏中具有高效性，为大规模动作场景提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We study protocols for verifying approximate optimality of strategies in
multi-armed bandits and normal-form games. As the number of actions available
to each player is often large, we seek protocols where the number of queries to
the utility oracle is sublinear in the number of actions. We prove that such
verification is possible for sufficiently smooth strategies that do not put too
much probability mass on any specific action. We provide protocols for
verifying that a smooth policy for a multi-armed bandit is
$\varepsilon$-optimal. Our verification protocols require provably fewer arm
queries than learning. Furthermore, we establish a nearly-tight lower bound on
the query complexity of verification in our settings. As an application, we
show how to use verification for bandits to achieve verification in normal-form
games. This gives a protocol for verifying whether a given strategy profile is
an approximate strong smooth Nash equilibrium, with a query complexity that is
sublinear in the number of actions.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于哈密顿动力学的新方法，用于零和博弈的在线优化，能够在有限迭代次数内找到纳什均衡，且支持并行化和任意学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究零和博弈的在线优化方法，传统方法存在局限性，如收敛速度慢或无法并行化。

Method: 基于哈密顿动力学设计新方法，通过交替梯度下降在有限迭代次数内找到纳什均衡。

Result: 实验证明新方法显著优于传统方法，支持并行化和任意学习率。

Conclusion: 新方法为零和博弈的在线优化提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We study online optimization methods for zero-sum games, a fundamental
problem in adversarial learning in machine learning, economics, and many other
domains. Traditional methods approximate Nash equilibria (NE) using either
regret-based methods (time-average convergence) or contraction-map-based
methods (last-iterate convergence). We propose a new method based on
Hamiltonian dynamics in physics and prove that it can characterize the set of
NE in a finite (linear) number of iterations of alternating gradient descent in
the unbounded setting, modulo degeneracy, a first in online optimization.
Unlike standard methods for computing NE, our proposed approach can be
parallelized and works with arbitrary learning rates, both firsts in
algorithmic game theory. Experimentally, we support our results by showing our
approach drastically outperforms standard methods.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了双边贸易中预算平衡约束与遗憾率之间的权衡关系，设计了一种算法，通过允许预算平衡约束的违反程度，实现了最优遗憾率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双边贸易是算法经济学的核心问题，现有研究表明在每步强制预算平衡时无法实现无遗憾学习。本文旨在探索预算平衡约束的违反程度如何影响最优遗憾率。

Method: 设计了一种算法，通过允许预算平衡约束违反程度$T^{\beta}$（$\beta \in [\frac{3}{4}, \frac{6}{7}]$），实现遗憾率为$\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$。

Result: 算法实现了$\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$的遗憾率，并通过匹配下界证明了这一结果的紧性。

Conclusion: 本文完全刻画了预算平衡约束违反与遗憾率之间的权衡关系，验证了Bernasconi等人的上下界结果均为紧的。

Abstract: Bilateral trade is a central problem in algorithmic economics, and recent
work has explored how to design trading mechanisms using no-regret learning
algorithms. However, no-regret learning is impossible when budget balance has
to be enforced at each time step. Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] show how this
impossibility can be circumvented by relaxing the budget balance constraint to
hold only globally over all time steps. In particular, they design an algorithm
achieving regret of the order of $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ and provide a lower bound
of $\Omega(T^{5/7})$.
  In this work, we interpolate between these two extremes by studying how the
optimal regret rate varies with the allowed violation of the global budget
balance constraint. Specifically, we design an algorithm that, by violating the
constraint by at most $T^{\beta}$ for any given $\beta \in [\frac{3}{4},
\frac{6}{7}]$, attains regret $\tilde O(T^{1 - \beta/3})$. We complement this
result with a matching lower bound, thus fully characterizing the trade-off
between regret and budget violation. Our results show that both the $\tilde
O(T^{3/4})$ upper bound in the global budget balance case and the
$\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound under unconstrained budget balance violation
obtained by Bernasconi et al. [Ber+24] are tight.

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are a central component of many quantum
machine learning algorithms, offering a hybrid quantum-classical framework
that, under certain aspects, can be considered similar to classical deep neural
networks. A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial
inputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While
formal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical
models, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs.
Here, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the
formal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation
methods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of
interval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that
quantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable
dependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by
introducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where
the verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity
analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification
benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational
quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most
current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to
task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce
a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically
generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of
constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies
that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond
classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary
matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable
exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using
entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define
unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per
qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and
evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified
64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently
outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing
configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical
model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,
nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the
classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered
up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and
generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.
