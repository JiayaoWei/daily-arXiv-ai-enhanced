### [1] [Loki's Dance of Illusions: A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02870)
*Chaozhuo Li,Pengbo Wang,Chenxu Wang,Litian Zhang,Zheng Liu,Qiwei Ye,Yuanbo Xu,Feiran Huang,Xi Zhang,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的“幻觉”问题，即模型生成看似真实但实际虚假的信息，并分析了其原因、检测方法和解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的幻觉问题在金融、法律和医疗等领域可能导致严重后果，因此需要深入研究其根源和解决方法。

Method: 研究系统地分类和分析了幻觉的成因、检测方法及解决方案，并评估了现有策略的有效性。

Result: 研究揭示了幻觉的根本原因，并提出了改进现有方法的思路，为开发更有效的解决方案奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 论文为全面解决LLMs中的幻觉问题提供了理论支持，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

### [2] [ChatGPT is not A Man but Das Man: Representativeness and Structural Consistency of Silicon Samples Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02919)
*Dai Li,Linzhuo Li,Huilian Sophie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT和Llama在模拟人类意见时存在结构不一致和同质化问题，可能误导政策制定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为人类意见替代品的有效性，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 通过向ChatGPT和Llama系列模型提问ANES 2020中的问题，分析其回答与人类数据的差异。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著的结构不一致和严重的同质化现象。

Conclusion: LLMs不适合直接替代人类调查数据，可能强化刻板印象和误导政策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的语音大语言模型，用于联合执行说话人日志和自动语音识别，并在MLC-SLM挑战赛的Task II中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音大语言模型在多语言真实对话中因数据稀缺而受限的问题。

Method: 通过重新格式化训练数据和修改推理过程，提出端到端的联合说话人日志和语音识别模型。

Result: 在Task II中，模型相对于基线实现了54.87%的相对改进，排名第8。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了预分段音频的模糊性问题，并展示了语音大语言模型在多任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

### [4] [Mitigating Hidden Confounding by Progressive Confounder Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02928)
*Hao Yang,Haoxuan Li,Luyu Chen,Haoxiang Wang,Xu Chen,Mingming Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCI利用大语言模型（LLM）的语义推理和世界知识，通过迭代生成、填补和验证隐藏混杂变量，显著提升了观察数据中因果效应估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏混杂变量是观察数据中估计因果效应的主要挑战，现有方法大多依赖无混杂假设，而ProCI首次尝试利用LLM解决这一问题。

Method: ProCI框架通过LLM的语义推理能力发现混杂变量，并利用其世界知识进行反事实推理，采用分布推理策略避免输出崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，ProCI能够发现有意义的混杂变量，并在多种数据集和LLM上显著改善因果效应估计。

Conclusion: ProCI为利用LLM解决隐藏混杂问题提供了有效框架，提升了因果推理的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

### [5] [Theory of Mind in Action: The Instruction Inference Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02935)
*Fardin Saad,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah,Munindar P. Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Tomcat的LLM代理，通过指令推断任务评估其心智理论（ToM）能力，并比较了两种实现方法（Fs-CoT和CP）在三种LLM上的表现。结果显示，Fs-CoT方法在GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1上表现接近人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估动态、目标导向和协作环境中的ToM能力，以促进人机协作。

Method: 设计了指令推断任务，开发了基于LLM的代理Tomcat，并实现了两种推理方法（Fs-CoT和CP）。

Result: Tomcat的Fs-CoT方法在GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1上表现与人类参与者相当。

Conclusion: Tomcat展示了在人机协作中实现ToM推理的潜力。

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

### [6] [A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Reliable and Robust Structural Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02938)
*Jiachen Liu,Ziheng Geng,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Paolo Bocchini,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在结构工程领域的可靠性，并提出了一种通过代码生成任务增强其性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在土木工程等专业领域的应用潜力，填补其在结构分析中的空白。

Method: 通过基准数据集测试LLM的可靠性，并提出一种结合链式思维和少量示例提示的代码生成方法。

Result: LLM在原始测试中表现不足，但改进后的代理模型准确率超过99%。

Conclusion: 将结构分析任务转化为代码生成任务可显著提升LLM的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

### [7] [Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02940)
*Tiffany Duneau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCirc框架通过组合单词单元构建文本模型，支持组合泛化和组合可解释性。研究比较了量子电路和经典神经网络在组合任务上的表现，发现神经网络更容易过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索组合模型在自然语言处理中的潜力，特别是组合泛化和可解释性。

Method: 使用DisCoCirc框架，结合类别理论语言，测试量子电路和神经网络在bAbI任务扩展数据集上的表现。

Result: 两种模型在部分任务上表现相近，但在系统性任务上差异显著，神经网络更容易过拟合。

Conclusion: 组合模型在泛化和可解释性方面具有潜力，但不同架构在不同任务上表现各异。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

### [8] [The Application of Large Language Models on Major Depressive Disorder Support Based on African Natural Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02947)
*Linyan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合非洲传统植物药物与现代AI技术（如DeepSeek语言模型）开发抑郁症支持系统的潜力，以弥补传统抗抑郁疗法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗抑郁疗法存在延迟起效、副作用和治疗抵抗等问题，非洲传统植物药物提供了一种可能的替代方案。

Method: 研究分析了非洲药用植物的抗抑郁特性及其药理机制，并开发了一个AI支持系统，提供基于证据的草药信息。

Result: AI系统能够结合传统知识与现代医疗，提供个性化、文化适宜的抑郁症支持。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可作为传统知识与现代医疗之间的桥梁，为抑郁症治疗提供新思路。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Entity-Context Divergence (ECD)的指标，用于衡量LLMs在检索增强生成（RAG）中整合外部知识的准确性，并发现当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低。作者提出了Radiant框架，通过优化检索证据与生成内容的交互，显著提升了RAG的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在检索增强生成中难以准确整合外部知识，导致事实不一致。为了量化这一问题并提升模型性能，作者提出了ECD指标和Radiant框架。

Method: 引入Entity-Context Divergence (ECD)指标评估LLMs的RAG能力，并提出Radiant框架，扩展Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)以优化检索证据与生成内容的交互。

Result: 实证分析显示，当前LLMs的RAG能力较低，而Radiant框架显著提升了模型在噪声环境、知识冲突和减少幻觉等场景中的性能。

Conclusion: Radiant框架通过优化检索与生成的交互，显著提升了LLMs在RAG任务中的事实一致性和上下文准确性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

### [10] [Evaluating AI Counseling in Japanese: Counselor, Client, and Evaluator Roles Assessed by Motivational Interviewing Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02950)
*Keita Kiuchi,Yoshikazu Fujimoto,Hideyuki Goto,Tomonori Hosokawa,Makoto Nishimura,Yosuke Sato,Izumi Sezai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在日语治疗背景下的三种咨询角色表现，发现结构化多步对话提示（SMDP）显著提升AI咨询师表现，评估AI与人类评分者在某些指标上表现相当，但存在系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI在非英语（日语）心理咨询场景中的表现，为开发文化敏感的AI心理健康工具提供基准和改进方向。

Method: 使用GPT-4-turbo和Claude-3-Opus-SMDP等AI系统生成咨询对话，并由15名人类专家根据MITI手册4.2.1进行评估。

Result: SMDP显著优于零样本提示；评估AI在部分指标上与人类评分者相当，但存在系统性高估；不同模型表现出特定偏差；客户AI模拟情感范围有限。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助非英语心理咨询设定了基准，并指出通过提示工程和微调改进的方向，对开发文化敏感AI工具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，用于增强预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全领域的理解能力，同时保留其通用语言能力。通过实验验证，该方法在多个网络安全基准测试中表现优异，且数据效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型缺乏网络安全领域的专业知识，限制了其在网络安全分析中的有效性。本研究旨在通过领域自适应持续预训练方法，提升模型在网络安全领域的表现。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，对三种解码器架构（Llama-3.1-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct）进行训练，使用126百万词的网络安全语料库，并通过约束训练参数和分布式FSDP训练平衡领域专业化和知识保留。

Result: 在CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval三个网络安全基准测试中，模型表现显著提升。Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP模型分别达到0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于其他专用模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，目标持续预训练能够高效实现网络安全领域的适应，为威胁分析、漏洞评估等任务提供专用AI助手的基础，同时挑战了LLM专业化对大数据量的传统假设。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在高风险AI应用中的广泛使用，隐私、数据保护和透明度等法律/伦理问题日益突出，因此需要一种隐私保护的学习方法。

Method: 使用NER技术匿名化文本数据中的敏感信息（如个人身份或地理位置），并结合去性别偏见的现有方法，提出隐私和偏见感知的LLMs（PB-LLMs）。

Result: 在24,000份简历数据的实验中，隐私保护技术有效保护了候选人隐私，同时保持了系统性能。

Conclusion: 提出的PB-LLMs不仅适用于简历评分，还可推广到其他LLM-based AI应用，提升了隐私保护和公平性。

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Motivation: LLMs在数学教育中具有潜力，但高计算成本限制了其应用。本文旨在通过模型压缩降低成本，同时保持性能。

Method: 压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量，并通过蒸馏技术训练一个参数更少的学生模型。

Result: 学生模型仅使用1/12的参数，保持了教师模型近90%的性能，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型压缩的成功展示了其通用性，为智能教育系统提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

Conclusion: GAF-Guard为LLM治理提供了以用户和用例为中心的解决方案，提升了部署安全性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

Motivation: 能力问题（CQs）在知识工程中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统比较，因此需要评估不同方法的输出特性。

Method: 通过手动、模式实例化和LLM生成三种方法从文化遗产需求中生成CQs，并评估其可接受性、模糊性、相关性、可读性和复杂性。

Result: 不同方法生成的CQs具有不同特性，LLM生成可作为初始方法，但需进一步优化。

Conclusion: LLM生成CQs有潜力，但需结合其他方法优化，以更好地满足需求建模。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Conclusion: 结论强调需要更系统和全面的AI安全措施，并持续进行对抗性测试，同时指出当前通用LLMs在全面安全性上的技术挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Motivation: ICD-10代码分类是医疗领域关键但易出错的任务，研究旨在评估LLMs在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集的1,500份摘要，测试11种LLMs（包括推理和非推理模型），通过临床NLP工具（cTAKES）提取医学术语，并以编码员格式提示模型。

Result: 模型表现普遍不佳（F1≤57%），推理模型优于非推理模型，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳。慢性心脏病等代码分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs可辅助人工编码，但尚不可靠；未来需探索混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的时间信息，限制了其捕捉用户偏好演变的能力。

Method: 提出CETRec框架，利用因果推理量化时间信息的影响，设计反事实调优目标优化模型的时间敏感性。

Result: CETRec有效提升了LLM对绝对时间戳和相对顺序模式的识别能力。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果推理显著改善了LLM在推荐系统中对时间信息的利用效果。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

Conclusion: 该方法有助于促进社会平等和语言多样性，确保低资源语言不被忽视。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Conclusion: MSA方法是一种有前景的替代方案，可突破专家标注的限制，支持全球语言谱系研究。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

Method: 使用两个模型实例分别设计策略（P）和监控（M），在编程任务中测试合谋能力。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率低，但偶尔能通过非明显信号成功合谋。

Conclusion: 语言模型在特定条件下能独立达成合谋策略，但成功率有限。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务QF-CES，利用多源意见摘要（M-OS）生成查询聚焦的可解释比较摘要，并通过LLMs实现高效、个性化的推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏全面的比较视角，无法满足产品推荐的需求，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出QF-CES任务，构建MS-Q2P数据集，利用LLMs生成表格形式的比较摘要，并通过M-OS减少推理延迟。

Result: M-OS比直接输入方法（DIA）减少约40%的延迟，QF-CES-PROMPT评估显示与人类判断的平均Spearman相关性为0.74。

Conclusion: QF-CES方法在生成和评估查询聚焦的比较摘要方面具有潜力，适用于个性化、隐私保护的推荐系统。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

### [30] [Beyond Overcorrection: Evaluating Diversity in T2I Models with DIVBENCH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03015)
*Felix Friedrich,Thiemo Ganesha Welsch,Patrick Schramowski,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVBENCH是一个评估框架，用于衡量文本到图像（T2I）生成中的过度多样化和不足多样化问题。研究发现，现有模型在多样化方面表现有限，而某些方法会过度修正。上下文感知方法（如LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写）能有效平衡多样性和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型的多样化策略常忽略上下文适当性，导致过度多样化，即修改了明确指定的属性。

Method: 提出DIVBENCH基准和评估框架，系统评估T2I模型的多样化表现，并测试上下文感知方法（如FairDiffusion和提示重写）。

Result: 大多数模型多样化有限，但某些方法会过度修正。上下文感知方法能有效平衡多样性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写）能有效解决多样化问题，避免过度修正。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: LiveRAG挑战赛成功推动了RAG技术的研究，并为未来相关竞赛和评估方法提供了参考。

Abstract: The LiveRAG Challenge at SIGIR 2025, held between March and May 2025,
provided a competitive platform for advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) technologies. Participants from academia and industry were invited to
develop a RAG-based question-answering system using a fixed corpus
(Fineweb-10BT) and a common open-source LLM (Falcon3-10B-Instruct). The goal
was to facilitate challenging comparisons of retrieval and prompting
strategies. During the Live Challenge Day, 70 teams from 27 different countries
provided answers and supportive information to 500 unseen questions within a
strict two-hour time window. Evaluation was conducted in two stages: first an
automated LLM-as-a-judge approach was used to compute correctness and
faithfulness score, then a manual review of top ranked submissions was
conducted. The finalists were announced on June 12, 2025, with prizes awarded
during the LiveRAG Workshop at SIGIR 2025 in Padua, Italy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的代理框架，将多轮工具调用嵌入大语言模型，显著提升了表格问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖两阶段管道（静态表格检索和封闭域回答），限制了效率和准确性。

Method: 结合BM25+搜索API和SQLite执行器，通过两阶段微调（监督学习和异步GRPO强化学习）优化4B参数模型。

Result: 准确率从零样本的单位数提升到0.86精确匹配。

Conclusion: 结构化工具调用与强化学习结合，实现了高效、准确的表格问答。

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Result: 展示了该方法的可行性，并开源了“生命之书”工具包（BOLT）。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究社区提供了一种结合深度与规模的新途径，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Motivation: 解决医疗文档生成的负担和隐私问题，提供一种低成本、高隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 使用PEFT和LoRA对Llama 3.2 1B模型进行微调，并在合成和真实医疗转录数据上评估。

Result: 微调后的模型在ROUGE-1、BERTScore等指标上显著提升，临床质量评估也显示幻觉减少和事实准确性提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持隐私和低成本的同时，显著提升了医疗文档生成的质量，适合资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无需训练的解码策略CNTP，通过在高熵步骤采样多条路径并选择最低困惑度的路径，显著提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM默认的解码策略在模型对测试问题不确定时表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的解码方法。

Method: 在高熵步骤采样多条独立路径，遇到标点符号停止，选择困惑度最低的路径。

Result: CNTP在LLM和MLLM上均显著优于现有解码策略，结合自洽性可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is
available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

Conclusion: 偏好过滤与LSTM门控机制是高效建模用户偏好的可行路径。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

TL;DR: K-Function框架通过结合子词转录、客观评分和可操作反馈，解决了儿童语言评估中的自动语音识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语言评估因高音调、长音素和稀疏数据导致自动语音识别困难，需要一种准确且可解释的方法。

Method: Kids-WFST结合Wav2Vec2音素编码器和音素相似性Dysfluent-WFST，捕捉儿童特有错误。

Result: Kids-WFST在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别达到1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪婪搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 高精度音素识别为完整的诊断-反馈循环奠定了基础，支持可扩展的临床语言评估。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

Motivation: 现有的语义互操作性标准在临床数据交换中仍存在耗时、资源密集和技术挑战的问题，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索，设计提示词引导模型将表格字段映射到对应的FHIR资源。

Result: 初始测试中资源识别的F1分数达到完美，GPT-4o表现优于Llama 3.2；实际应用中准确率略有下降至94%，但通过提示策略优化恢复了稳健映射。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于上下文感知的LLM驱动临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR是可行的，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础。未来工作将专注于模型微调、扩展支持标准和开发交互界面。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应奖励跟随（ARF）框架，通过高精度情感分析器和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，将用户自由反馈转化为连续偏好分数，优化强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）的个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法（如PPO、DPO）依赖二元偏好范式，虽降低标注成本但需大量人工且仅捕获群体偏好，无法满足个体化需求。

Method: 提出ARF框架，结合情感分析器和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，通过数据增强和TB微调算法优化奖励建模。

Result: 在多个模型和偏好领域的实验中，ARF比PPO和DPO分别提升3.3%和7.6%，同时保持与PPO和DPO的理论一致性。

Conclusion: ARF通过自主奖励建模，为RLHF提供了一种可扩展、个性化和经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面表现出色，但情感智能不足，现有强化学习方法在情感对话领域应用不足。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，利用模拟用户的情感评分作为奖励信号，通过PPO算法微调模型。

Result: Sentient-Benchmark得分从13.3提升至79.2，同时保留数学和编程能力；实验显示不同模型在情感对话中表现差异。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升语言模型情感智能的有效途径，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现出色，但在面对不可解或超出能力范围的问题时，容易生成不可靠回答，严重影响其可靠性。现有研究主要关注知识任务中的不可解问题，数学推理任务尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过构建包含可解和不可解问题的ReliableMath数据集，评估LLMs的可靠性。提出可靠提示和对齐策略以提升模型表现。

Result: LLMs无法直接识别不可解问题，总是生成虚假回答。使用可靠提示后，大型LLMs在不可解问题上表现有所提升，但小型LLMs几乎无改进。对齐策略显著提升了小型LLMs的可靠性。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学推理任务中的可靠性仍需改进，尤其是小型LLMs。提出的对齐策略为提升模型可靠性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

### [43] [From Measurement to Mitigation: Exploring the Transferability of Debiasing Approaches to Gender Bias in Maltese Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03142)
*Melanie Galea,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的性别偏见问题，特别是在马耳他语等低资源语言中，并尝试将英语的去偏见方法迁移到马耳他语模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在NLP任务中表现优异，但仍存在社会偏见，尤其是性别偏见，这对边缘化社区尤为有害。研究关注马耳他语这类低资源语言，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 研究采用BERTu和mBERTu模型，将英语的去偏见方法（如Counterfactual Data Augmentation等）迁移到马耳他语中，并使用CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准进行评估。

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了开发更包容的多语言NLP方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言中解决性别偏见的挑战，呼吁更多针对多语言NLP的包容性方法。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

TL;DR: MedVAL是一个自监督框架，通过合成数据训练评估模型，用于检测语言模型生成的医学文本的准确性，无需医生标注或参考输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在临床环境中生成医学文本的准确性和安全性评估问题，避免依赖昂贵的人工审核和缺乏参考输出的限制。

Method: 提出MedVAL框架，利用合成数据训练评估模型，并引入MedVAL-Bench数据集进行验证。

Result: MedVAL显著提高了与医生评估的一致性，F1分数从66%提升至83%，并在多个任务和模型上表现优异。

Conclusion: MedVAL展示了语言模型在医学文本验证方面接近专家水平的能力，为临床集成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (
https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing
open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching
expert-level validation ability for medical text.

TL;DR: 研究发现，推理模型的链式思维（CoT）生成过程中存在一个“谨慎”方向，影响模型是否拒绝或响应有害请求。通过干预该方向，可以操控模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究链式思维生成如何影响推理模型对越狱攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 分析DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型的CoT生成，识别“谨慎”方向，并通过干预该方向进行实验。

Result: 发现干预CoT中的“谨慎”方向可增加有害响应，提升攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 链式思维是推理模型中对抗性操控的新目标。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs广泛应用于高风险领域，但其可能传递偏见或幻觉内容，影响人类决策，因此需要研究其偏见的严重性和缓解方法。

Method: 评估三个LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，分析其一致性、幻觉和偏见情况，并测试18种缓解方法的效果。

Result: LLMs在21.86%的情况下改变情感，57.33%的情况下产生幻觉，5.94%的情况下存在首因偏差。针对性干预方法有效。

Conclusion: LLMs在高风险领域的应用需要技术保障和用户中心干预，以解决其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars
using two combinatorial definitions of graphs. With this lens, we demonstrate
that the adjoining operation defines a pre-Lie operation and subsequently forms
a Lie algebra. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by showing how
one of our mathematical formulations of TAG captures properties of the TAG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言中因语言覆盖不足和分词问题导致的检索准确性低的问题，同时减少幻觉现象。

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT模型，结合了查询与文档的延迟词级交互、基于形态的分词及双层Transformer编码，生成细粒度且自包含的上下文嵌入。

Result: 在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中，KinyaColBERT优于基线模型和主流商业文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: KinyaColBERT为低资源语言的RAG系统提供了高效且经济的检索解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大规模语言模型（LLM）预训练数据质量，解决现有方法在精细化和效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出RefineX框架，通过专家指导的端到端优化结果转化为最小化编辑程序，训练高效可靠的细化模型。

Result: RefineX在750M模型上平均提升2.6%-7.2%，且使用更少训练标记达到可比性能。

Conclusion: RefineX是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化解决方案。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

TL;DR: GRAFT是一种基于图的文档级机器翻译系统，利用LLM代理解决现有方法在捕捉话语现象和保持翻译一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译方法难以有效捕捉话语现象，且依赖启发式规则分割文档，导致翻译不准确或不一致。

Method: 提出GRAFT框架，结合分段、基于DAG的依赖建模和话语感知翻译，形成统一系统。

Result: 在多个翻译方向和领域中，GRAFT显著优于现有方法，平均提升2.8 BLEU（IWSLT2017）和2.3 BLEU（英中翻译）。

Conclusion: GRAFT能有效处理话语现象，生成连贯且上下文准确的翻译。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在表达前会默读以理解上下文并构思内容，而LLMs通常缺乏这一内部处理阶段。本文旨在赋予LLMs类似能力以提升其生成质量。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）提供初始上下文提示（‘阅读空间’）；2）设计‘阅读伙伴’架构，辅助模型处理输入并提供更精细的上下文。

Result: 这些简单方法显著提升了模型性能，尤其在准确性上表现出多点的提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类的‘默读’行为，LLMs能够生成更具深度的回应，向更接近人类文本处理的方向迈进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the

strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本（MGT）泛滥的问题，现有检测器在通用任务上表现良好，但在维基百科编辑任务中泛化能力差。

Method: 定义了三种编辑任务（段落写作、摘要、文本风格转换），使用多语言数据集和多生成器生成MGT，并评估多种检测器。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强调了在多样化、任务特定的数据上评估检测器的重要性，以确保其在编辑驱动场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以提高可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

Result: SMCLM在无监督方法中达到先进水平，与监督方法竞争，且提出了一套全面的自动评估指标。

Conclusion: SMCLM在生成高质量语义等效文本方面表现优异，同时需改进现有评估指标的可靠性。

Abstract: This article introduces semantically meaningful causal language modeling
(SMCLM), a selfsupervised method of training autoregressive models to generate
semantically equivalent text. Our approach involves using semantically
meaningful text representation as an initial embedding in the autoregressive
training and generation processes. The extensive empirical study demonstrates
that the SMCLM approach makes autoregressive models capable of learning robust
and high-quality paraphrase generation. The proposed method is competitive with
the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics
that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects.
Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that
are widely used in paraphrase generation evaluation, including BLEU, ROUGE, and
BERTScore.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从法文临床笔记中提取13种社会健康决定因素（SDoH），展示了自然语言处理（NLP）在非英语电子健康记录（EHR）系统中提升数据完整性的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但在结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中常不完整或缺失。研究旨在通过NLP技术填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Flan-T5-Large模型，基于法国南特大学医院的临床笔记标注数据，训练模型提取SDoH。评估分为两个层次：识别SDoH类别及关联值，以及提取详细SDoH信息。

Result: 模型在识别常见SDoH类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）上表现优异（F1分数>0.80），但对数据有限或表达多变的类别（如就业状况、收入等）表现较差。模型识别了95.8%的患者至少有一个SDoH，远高于结构化EHR数据的2.8%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了NLP在非英语EHR系统中提升SDoH数据完整性的潜力，但也指出了训练数据不足和模型泛化能力受限等问题。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

*Heather Lent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言性对语言模型安全性的影响，指出当前NLP安全研究过于以英语为中心，并强调需要关注低资源语言的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究主要关注英语，忽视了多语言环境下语言模型的安全性，尤其是低资源语言可能成为安全弱点。

Method: 扩展了现有的对抗攻击方法，评估了70种语言的单语和多语语言模型的安全性。

Result: 发现单语模型参数规模不足以保证安全性，而多语言性虽有助于提升安全性，但并非总是有效。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言社区中更安全部署语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

TL;DR: BMMR是一个大规模双语、多模态、多学科推理数据集，用于评估和开发大型多模态模型（LMMs）。包含110k大学水平问题，涵盖300个学科，支持多种题型，并附带高质量推理路径。实验显示当前SOTA模型仍有提升空间，开源模型落后于商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为社区提供一个全面评估和开发大型多模态模型的数据集，填补当前多学科推理数据集的空白。

Method: 通过人工参与的框架构建BMMR数据集，分为BMMR-Eval（评估用）和BMMR-Train（训练用），并提出BMMR-Verifier用于精细评估推理路径。

Result: 实验表明SOTA模型在BMMR-Eval上仍有不足，推理模型存在学科偏见，开源模型表现较差，但微调可缩小差距。

Conclusion: BMMR数据集和BMMR-Verifier为多模态模型的开发和评估提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型的挑战，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

Result: Agentic RAG在复杂或模糊问题上优于传统方法，系统已集成到移动应用中。

Conclusion: AI-VaxGuide为临床提供了实时、便捷的疫苗信息访问工具。

Abstract: Vaccination plays a vital role in global public health, yet healthcare
professionals often struggle to access immunization guidelines quickly and
efficiently. National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive
and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially
during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a
multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static
vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base.
Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly

Motivation: 随着数字情感支持需求增长，需要评估语言模型在提供真实、持续共情方面的能力，现有评估落后于模型发展。

Method: 开发H2HTalk基准，包含4650个多样化场景，引入安全依恋人格模块（SAP），并测试50个模型。

Result: 模型在长期规划和记忆保留方面表现不佳，尤其在用户需求隐含或变化时。

Conclusion: H2HTalk为情感智能伴侣提供了首个全面基准，推动安全且有意义的心理支持模型发展。

Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions
offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation
lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a
benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic
interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk
features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary
planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding
previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment
Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer
interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that
long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models
struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent

TL;DR: 研究探讨舌癌手术后对发音清晰度和变异性的影响，发现术后清晰度在正常范围内，但变异性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 舌癌手术可能影响舌头的活动性和肌肉结构，进而影响发音清晰度和变异性，需量化评估其影响。

Method: 通过句子朗读任务，使用VAI和VFD指标，比较11名舌癌患者术前术后及11名正常人的发音数据。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低但仍属正常范围，VFD显示/i/音变异性增加。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

Motivation: 在现实翻译场景中，术语通常存在多义性，且正确性依赖于上下文和公司风格指南。神经机器翻译系统难以处理此类问题，但公司环境中存在大量人工后编辑数据可用于学习。

Method: 采用偏好优化方法，将术语后编辑作为偏好知识，结合监督微调和偏好优化，无需一对一术语词典或解码时人工干预。

Result: 在英德后编辑数据上，该方法显著提升了术语准确性，且未显著降低COMET分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了术语歧义问题，并发布了测试集和术语词典以供研究。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

Motivation: 知识图谱数据在多跳推理中广泛应用，但缺乏对双曲空间与欧几里得空间的详细对比研究。

Method: 通过将双曲表示与编码器-解码器模型简单结合，进行一系列控制实验。

Result: 双曲空间在多跳推理中表现优于欧几里得空间，且可学习曲率的初始化方式效果更佳。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在层次结构数据中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Result: 构建了包含376K维基百科文本和1.25M编辑操作的数据集，覆盖2019至2025年的10个Wikidata快照。实验表明基于文本更新知识图谱存在挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，并将公开数据集和模型实现。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

Motivation: 解决方言数据稀缺对深度学习模型在方言识别中的限制。

Method: 利用RVC将音频样本转换为统一目标说话者，减少说话者相关变异性，突出方言特征。

Result: RVC单独使用或与其他增强方法结合均能提升分类性能。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法设计多样但缺乏系统性研究，限制了未来发展，因此需要分解并分析其关键组成部分的影响。

Method: 将数据剪枝分解为数据表示和选择算法两部分，通过理论和实证分析它们对实例选择的影响。

Result: 更好的数据表示（如训练梯度）能提升实例选择效果；不同选择算法在不同场景下表现各异，且不一定符合设计目标。

Conclusion: 数据表示对实例选择至关重要，选择算法需根据场景定制，且需谨慎评估其实际效果。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具多为事后分析、依赖标量指标或集成复杂，难以全面部署和维护模型可解释性分析。

Method: TRACE结合ABSynth合成语料库，提供轻量级的训练中分析，包括特征探测、内在维度、Hessian曲率和输出诊断。

Result: 实验显示TRACE能捕捉传统标量指标忽略的现象，如早期句法涌现、延迟语义获取和表征压缩。

Conclusion: TRACE使Transformer分析更具可解释性、可操作性和可重复性，支持层间诊断、收敛早停和结构错误检测。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查评估数据集包含事后分析和标注者提示，与现实场景不符，限制了评估的真实性。

Method: 提出PFO数据集，移除事后分析和标注者提示；设计RAV框架，通过三个代理（问题生成、答案生成、标签生成）迭代验证。

Result: RAV在多个基准上表现优于现有方法，性能下降最小（16.3%）。

Conclusion: RAV框架在事实核查任务中表现出色，具有跨领域和标签粒度的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据多样性和质量评估上存在局限性，TACOS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用LLMs为查询分配开放标签并进行归一化聚类，采用比较评分方法评估样本质量。

Result: TACOS在多个数据集和LLM架构上表现优异，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0上取得领先成绩。

Conclusion: TACOS是一种高效且有效的IFT数据选择方法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StructSense是一个基于LLM的模块化、任务无关的开源框架，用于结构化信息提取，解决了领域敏感性和跨任务通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非结构化源（如自由文本和科学文献）中提取结构化信息对加速科学发现至关重要，但现有LLM在专业领域和跨任务适应性上表现不足。

Method: StructSense结合领域本体知识、自评估反馈循环和人工验证机制，提升领域适应性和跨任务通用性。

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，克服了领域敏感性和跨任务通用性问题。

Conclusion: StructSense为结构化信息提取提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂领域和多样化任务。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

*Zhengkai Lin,Zhihang Fu,Ze Chen,Chao Chen,Liang Xie,Wenxiao Wang,Deng Cai,Zheng Wang,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整大型推理模型（LRMs）思考速度的方法，以优化准确性与效率的权衡，实现了无需额外训练的高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）擅长慢速、深思熟虑的System 2思维，但缺乏快速、直觉的System 1思维，导致高计算开销和延迟。

Method: 通过识别控制慢速-快速思维转换的导向向量，实现基于表示编辑的测试时缩放效果，并结合实时难度估计动态调整推理策略。

Result: 在无需额外训练或成本的情况下，平均提升1.3%的准确性，同时减少8.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该方法为LRMs提供了动态调整推理速度的解决方案，支持更广泛的应用并启发未来研究。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Method: 开发多种代理策略（从进攻到防守），并在“Ô Ăn Quan”游戏中测试不同LLMs（如Llama-3系列）的表现。

Result: 实验结果揭示了LLMs在战略决策和动态状态管理中的优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的通用能力提供了深入见解，尤其是在推理和战略规划方面。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出MemOS，一个内存操作系统，用于解决大语言模型（LLMs）在长期上下文推理、持续个性化和知识一致性方面的内存管理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs缺乏明确的内存管理系统，限制了其在长期推理和知识更新方面的能力。现有方法如RAG虽引入外部知识，但仍为无状态解决方案。

Method: 提出MemOS，统一管理明文、基于激活和参数级内存，以MemCube为基本单元，支持内存内容的组合、迁移和融合。

Result: MemOS通过显式内存层降低训练和推理成本，并支持灵活的内存类型转换，提升LLMs的可控性和可塑性。

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs的持续学习和个性化建模奠定了基础，解决了信息分布和管理的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过AI模型与文档的无限固定点交互实现语义对齐，基于Alpay代数，引入函子系统保证唯一固定点的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型与文档语义对齐的问题，确保AI内部表示稳定且忠实于作者意图。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，构建函子系统，通过phi-infinity算子实现观察者（AI）与文本环境的协同演化。

Result: 证明了收敛的数学合理性、语义不变性和永久性，生成“共情嵌入”固定点。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层面的对齐提供了严格的范畴论路径，对语义安全和符号记忆有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型中的注意力机制，特别是‘sink token’现象，并提出了一种动态选择重要token的方法OrthoRank，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索sink token与其他token的关系，并利用这一现象改进token选择方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态的相似性，提出基于正交性的动态token选择方法OrthoRank。

Result: 实验表明，OrthoRank在相同稀疏度下表现优于层剪枝方法，困惑度更低，零样本准确率更高。

Conclusion: OrthoRank是一种有效的token选择方法，适用于提升语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

capabilities and limitations in genre prediction remain unclear. This work
analyzes three Large Language Models (LLMs) using the MovieLens-100K dataset to
assess their genre prediction capabilities. Our findings show that ChatGPT,
without fine-tuning, outperformed other LLMs, and fine-tuned ChatGPT performed
best overall. We set up zero-shot and few-shot prompts using audio
transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset,
covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres.
Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize
a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This
fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In
conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction
capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further
enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related
applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.

Method: 结合计算机视觉、自然语言处理和机器翻译的最新研究，分析模型崩溃现象及其对语言分布尾部的影响。

Result: 语言分布的尾部正在消失，随之消失的是它们所承载的叙事和身份。

Conclusion: 呼吁抵制语言扁平化，重新构想NLP领域，以鼓励、重视和保护多语言词汇和语言多样性及创造力。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from

Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving

Result: LLMs在文化推理方面存在显著挑战，能识别事实信息但难以应用于实际场景；明确的文化框架比仅依赖提示语言更有效提升性能。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench为LLMs文化理解研究提供支持，公开基准和排行榜以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Result: AdaPCR在多个QA基准测试中表现优于基线，特别是在多跳推理任务中。

Conclusion: 建模段落间依赖关系能显著提升检索效果，AdaPCR为开放域问答提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Result: XISM提供了公开可用的系统和演示视频，支持语言学家高效工作。

Conclusion: XISM结合数据与专家知识，为语义地图研究提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Semantic map models represent meanings or functions as nodes in a graph
constrained by the local connectivity hypothesis, with edges indicating their
associations. Widely used in typological linguistics, these models compare
interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both
typologists and computational linguists. The system

*Thomas Savage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Savage Conversation Forests (SCF) 是一种强化学习框架，通过分支对话架构优化多轮对话中的大语言模型（LLMs），在模拟医患对话中表现优于线性架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和GRPO）在单轮任务中表现良好，但在多轮应用（如诊断性患者访谈）中效果不佳，需理解早期对话对后续结果的影响。

Method: SCF采用分支对话架构，生成多轮对话的多种可能延续，以学习早期响应如何影响后续交互和诊断结果。

Result: 在模拟医患对话实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化LLMs在复杂多轮对话任务中的重要策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于次优方法4.5%，且对自定义知识图谱泛化性更好。

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG为自定义知识图谱问答提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但事实错误的输出，需要一种无需参考的检测方法。

Method: 利用多个随机生成中令牌对数概率的方差，设计了一种模型无关、可解释的幻觉检测框架。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集上验证，令牌级方差能可靠地突出模型输出的不稳定性，并与幻觉模式相关。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现且适用于多领域，为分析LLMs生成可靠性提供了有价值的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Motivation: 探索提示策略和微调技术在临床NLI任务中对LLM推理能力的影响。

Method: 采用四类提示策略，结合LoRA微调技术，在NLI4CT等基准上评估性能。

Result: 提示类型占性能差异的44%，LoRA微调提升8-12 F1，缩小与GPT-4o-mini的差距至7.1%。

Conclusion: 提示设计和轻量级微调可提升临床NLP系统的效率和可信度。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

Conclusion: PEFT框架在多文化名称识别中取得了显著突破，为实际应用提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

Method: 结合LLM提取与符号推理，构建可编辑关系图，通过七类逻辑约束优化，并提供交互式验证界面。

Result: 实验表明SymbolicThought提高标注准确性及一致性，显著降低时间成本。

Conclusion: SymbolicThought为叙事理解、可解释AI及LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 传统提示方法通常使用与任务无关的标记初始化提示，而Context Tuning利用任务相关示例，充分发挥模型的上下文学习能力。

Method: Context Tuning通过任务相关示例初始化可训练提示或前缀，利用模型的上下文学习能力提升少样本学习性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Context Tuning优于传统提示方法，且训练效率显著高于测试时训练。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且有效的少样本适应方法，适用于大型语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在图书馆服务中是否能够公平服务所有用户，避免因训练数据中的社会偏见而影响服务公平性。

Method: 通过提示六种先进的LLMs，模拟不同性别、种族/民族和机构角色的用户请求，评估其响应差异。

Result: LLMs在种族/民族上未显示差异，仅一个模型对女性有轻微偏见；对机构角色有适应性语言调整。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在学术图书馆参考服务中表现出公平且情境适应的沟通潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为R/S研究提供了高效、易用的工具，解决了传统方法中依赖专家知识和耗时的问题。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed

findings on topics on which they intend to pass a law, or family members of
seriously ill patients could read about clinical trials. The SimpleText CLEF
Lab focuses on exactly this problem of simplification of scientific text. Task
1.1 of the 2025 edition specifically handles the simplification of complex
sentences, so very short texts with little context. To tackle this task we
investigate the identification of complex terms in sentences which are
rephrased using small Gemini and OpenAI large language models for non-expert

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种介于循环和注意力机制之间的中间设计RAT，通过分块处理输入并结合局部线性循环和跨块软注意力，显著提升了长上下文场景下的计算效率，同时保持了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长上下文场景下因依赖软注意力而导致的计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 将输入分块，块内使用线性循环捕获局部依赖，块间使用软注意力建模长程交互，并通过调整块大小实现灵活权衡。

Result: RAT在训练和生成速度上分别提升了7倍和9倍，同时保持了与标准注意力相当的准确性。混合架构进一步提升了推理速度和性能。

Conclusion: RAT及其混合架构在长上下文任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度保留压缩的新型离站调优方法GradOT，解决了现有方法计算成本高和缺乏理论分析的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的集中式微调存在隐私风险，现有离站调优（OT）方法计算成本高且缺乏理论支持。

Method: 通过优化视角分析OT问题，提出选择性应用秩压缩和通道剪枝的梯度保留压缩方法。

Result: 实验表明，GradOT在隐私保护和模型性能上优于现有OT方法。

Conclusion: GradOT为OT提供了理论基础，并为大规模LLMs的离站调优提供了无需训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

TL;DR: MiDRE模型通过结合内部和外部推理专家，动态选择最优推理路径，显著提升了多模态讽刺检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉讽刺背后的深层逻辑，主要依赖浅层线索。

Method: 提出MiDRE模型，整合内部推理专家（检测图文不一致性）和外部推理专家（利用大型视觉语言模型生成结构化推理链），并通过自适应门控机制动态加权。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上表现优于基线模型，外部推理链即使有噪声也能提供有价值线索。

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内外推理路径，显著提升了讽刺检测的准确性和理解深度。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

TL;DR: DMDP是一种用于少样本多模态讽刺检测的新框架，通过模态特定的深度提示和跨模态对齐模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖大量标注数据，不适用于标注稀缺的现实场景，因此探索少样本设置下的讽刺检测问题。

Method: DMDP采用门控模态特定深度提示，注入多层以实现分层特征学习，并通过提示共享和跨模态对齐模块增强学习。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上，DMDP在少样本和极低资源设置下表现优异，跨数据集评估显示其泛化能力强。

Conclusion: DMDP在多模态讽刺检测中表现出色，尤其在少样本和跨领域场景下优于基线方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$S^3$的新框架，用于改进扩散语言模型（dLLMs）在可控文本生成中的表现，解决了现有方法在序列长度敏感性、幻觉率和推理成本上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本生成中展现出潜力，但现有方法在可控生成方面存在挑战，如序列长度敏感性、高幻觉率和推理成本高。

Method: 提出了$S^3$框架，通过将目标模式结构注入输出上下文，减少不必要计算并提升可控性。

Result: 实验表明，$S^3$在结构一致性上提升65%，内容保真度提升48%，幻觉率降低17%。

Conclusion: $S^3$为扩散模型在可控文本生成中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: AdS（Adapter-State Sharing）是一种轻量级框架，通过在上层插入适配器并引入适配器状态共享机制，显著减少了可训练参数，同时在多模态讽刺检测任务中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限环境下多模态图像-文本讽刺检测的挑战，避免现有方法对大型预训练模型完全微调的依赖。

Method: 基于CLIP框架，仅在上层插入适配器，并设计适配器状态共享机制，让文本适配器指导视觉适配器，实现高效跨模态学习。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS使用显著更少的可训练参数，取得了优于现有PEFT和完全微调方法的结果。

Conclusion: AdS为资源受限环境下的复杂多模态任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

*Rushil Thareja,Preslav Nakov,Praneeth Vepakomma,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-Fusion是一种差分隐私推理机制，用于保护大语言模型（LLM）上下文中的敏感信息，通过分组和混合输出分布实现隐私与效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保护上下文隐私时缺乏形式化保证或隐私/效用权衡不佳，DP-Fusion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将敏感令牌分组，对每组运行LLM，混合输出分布以控制隐私泄露。

Result: 通过参数ε控制隐私与效用，ε=0完全隐藏敏感信息，更高值提升效用。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion提供细粒度隐私控制，但需多次LLM前向传递。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Conclusion: 该研究为双脚本语言的LLM适配提供了全面方法，资源已公开。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

Result: 实验证明PRIME在长短上下文场景中均有效，并能捕捉动态个性化，避免流行度偏差。

Conclusion: PRIME为LLM个性化提供了统一的理论框架和有效方法，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新闻框架如何从文章传递到读者评论，填补NLP方法中忽略这一关系的空白。

Method: 改进框架标签，构建框架从句子级预测重构主导框架，并将文章与相关评论对齐。

Result: 在11个主题和两家新闻媒体中，评论中的框架重复使用高度相关，但主题模式不同。

Conclusion: 发布了一个性能良好的框架分类器、手动标注的数据集和大规模预测框架标签的数据集。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法通常作为监督学习问题，直接映射上下文到标签，但在跨域（OOD）场景下泛化能力较差。受人类标注者工作流程启发，作者希望改进这一问题。

Method: 将关系抽取重新定义为基于标注指南的推理任务，并引入R1-RE框架，利用小型语言模型的推理能力进行标注任务。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型的平均OOD准确率达到约70%，与GPT-4o等领先专有模型相当。

Conclusion: R1-RE框架不仅提升了关系抽取的跨域性能，还揭示了RLVR范式在训练动态和推理行为上的新见解。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Result: EOT-DETECT框架在零样本和思维链技术上表现优越，适用于多个电商领域。

Conclusion: 通过联合任务和结构化框架，论文填补了电商评论情感分析的研究空白，并提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across
e-commerce domains.

Conclusion: LOOM-Scope为长上下文评估提供了标准化和高效的解决方案，有助于推动相关研究。

Abstract: Long-context processing has become a fundamental capability for large
language models~(LLMs). To assess model's long-context performance, numerous
long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

TL;DR: 研究自监督语音模型（如Wav2vec 2.0）学习的单词重音表示，测试了五种语言的重音分类效果，发现重音表示具有语言特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型是否能有效捕捉不同语言中的单词重音特征，并比较可变重音语言与固定重音语言的表现差异。

Method: 使用Wav2vec 2.0模型提取语音表示，训练诊断性重音分类器，测试其在五种语言（荷兰语、英语、德语、匈牙利语、波兰语）中的表现。

Result: 分类器能高准确度区分重音与非重音音节，且重音表示具有语言特异性，可变重音语言与固定重音语言差异显著。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型能有效学习语言特异性的单词重音表示，为语音处理任务提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两步法自动将犹太-阿拉伯语转写为阿拉伯字母的方法，并评估了LLMs在此任务上的表现，展示了转写对阿拉伯NLP工具的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犹太-阿拉伯语用希伯来字母书写，转写为阿拉伯字母存在挑战，如字母映射模糊、拼写不一致和频繁的语码转换。

Method: 采用两步法：字符级映射和后校正处理语法和拼写错误，并首次对LLMs在此任务上的表现进行基准评估。

Result: 转写后的文本使阿拉伯NLP工具能够进行形态句法标注和机器翻译，这在原始文本上不可行。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了犹太-阿拉伯语转写的挑战，并为相关NLP任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点摘要仅依赖评论，缺乏产品元数据。研究旨在探索LLMs在多源观点摘要中的潜力，并填补评估数据集的空白。

Method: 引入M-OS-EVAL数据集，评估摘要的7个维度。实验比较M-OS与传统摘要的用户偏好和性能。

Result: M-OS显著提升用户参与度，87%用户偏好M-OS。M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断相关性达0.74。

Conclusion: 多源观点摘要结合元数据能生成更优摘要，M-OS-EVAL为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

Motivation: 现有方法难以在资源受限的个人设备上实现实时个性化，云端模型缺乏本地用户信息，本地模型生成质量不足。

Method: 利用本地小模型的上下文感知与无关输出的对数差异作为云端大模型的引导信号，通过在线学习动态调整远程LLM的对数。

Result: 实验表明，CoSteer能有效生成个性化内容，保护隐私且计算开销可接受。

Conclusion: CoSteer通过协作框架平衡了生成质量与隐私保护，为个性化文本生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Result: 模型通过分布式编码和异常启发式记忆噪声标签，且记忆依赖推理机制。

Conclusion: 记忆标签噪声不会覆盖底层推理机制，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research

Method: 提出Spec-TOD框架，结合任务指令的LLMs和高效训练策略，使用轻量级LLMs减少监督需求。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上表现优异，显著减少标注数据需求。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD为低资源场景下的高效任务导向对话系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

Result: 生成的合成对话数据可用于训练高效的问题重写器，使现有对话无关的检索器能够用于OR-CONVQA任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA任务提供了一种可行的数据生成和训练方案，解决了领域特定数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Result: 模型收敛并生成连贯文本，在MMLU推理基准上优于传统可训练嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 高层语义并非嵌入层的固有属性，而是Transformer架构和数据规模的涌现特性。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注算法正确性，而忽视了视觉保真度和交互完整性，这限制了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成动态视觉内容方面的进展。

Method: ArtifactsBench通过程序化渲染生成的视觉内容，并通过时间截图捕捉其动态行为，结合多模态LLM（MLLM）进行评估，使用细粒度任务清单确保评分全面且可重复。

Result: 在1,825个任务上评估了30多个领先的LLM，自动化评估与人类偏好标准（WebDev Arena）的排名一致性达94.4%，与人类专家的成对一致性超过90%。

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个可靠自动化评估人类感知质量的框架，开源基准和工具将加速以用户为中心的生成模型的发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

TL;DR: Co-DETECT是一个混合主动标注框架，结合人类专家与大语言模型（LLMs）自动标注，用于文本分类中的边缘案例发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本分类中边缘案例难以通过初始标注规则处理的问题。

Method: 通过迭代过程，利用LLM标注数据并识别边缘案例，辅助用户完善标注规则。

Result: 用户研究和分析证明Co-DETECT能有效处理复杂现象。

Conclusion: Co-DETECT通过紧凑且通用的标注规则，提升了边缘案例的处理效果。

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models
(LLMs). Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset
provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and
quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

*Oliver Robert Fox,Giacomo Bergami,Graham Morgan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图和逻辑的混合可解释性方法，用于解决现有机器学习方法在文本相似性和逻辑分类任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习方法在文本相似性和逻辑分类任务中缺乏可解释性和准确性，尤其是无法区分逻辑蕴含、不一致性和无关性。

Method: 结合图和逻辑，生成一阶逻辑表示，并通过Montague Grammar创建机器和人类可读的表示。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法在捕捉全文相似性和逻辑分类任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模文本数据的透明和可靠信息检索提供了新方向。

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在NLP中表现卓越，但其在不同领域和数据集上的文本摘要能力尚未全面评估，且缺乏依赖少量训练数据的有效方法。

Method: 通过提示工程技术（零样本和上下文学习）评估六种LLMs在四个数据集上的性能，使用ROUGE和BERTScore指标，并分析推理时间。针对长文档，提出分块策略。

Result: LLMs在新闻和对话任务中表现优异，但对长科学文档需分块策略辅助。性能受模型参数、数据集属性和提示设计影响显著。

Conclusion: 研究为不同LLMs在不同任务类型中的行为提供了实用见解，推动了基于指令的高效NLP系统研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

TL;DR: SMART方法通过模拟学生与IRT模型对齐，预测开放题难度，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法估计题目难度成本高且无法应用于冷启动场景，需改进。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）对齐模拟学生与IRT模型，生成响应并拟合IRT模型。

Result: 实验表明SMART在真实数据集上优于其他预测方法。

Conclusion: SMART通过改进能力对齐，高效预测题目难度，适用于冷启动场景。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成框架的方法，通过显式建模助记规则，利用EM算法学习潜在结构和组合规则，生成可解释的系统化日语词汇助记法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语词汇学习对罗马字母背景的学习者具有挑战性，尤其是汉字（kanji）的复杂性和数量。现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的助记生成方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出生成框架，显式建模助记构造过程，使用新型EM算法学习潜在结构和组合规则。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在新学习者冷启动场景下表现良好，并揭示了有效助记创建的机制。

Conclusion: 该方法为日语词汇学习提供了一种可解释且系统化的助记生成方案。

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的能力及其滥用问题，提出了区分人工与机器生成文本（Task-A）及识别生成模型（Task-B）的方法，基于GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs生成文本的能力被滥用于钓鱼邮件、假新闻等，且检测难度增加，需开发区分人工与机器生成文本及识别生成模型的方法。

Method: 基于GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT的微调，分别针对Task-A（区分人工与机器文本）和Task-B（识别生成模型）。

Result: 微调后的GPT_4o-mini和BERT在Task-A中准确率达0.9547，Task-B中为0.4698。

Conclusion: 微调模型在区分人工与机器文本上表现优异，但识别生成模型仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过干预前向传递或正则化反向传播，鼓励语言模型在训练后阶段更有效地利用预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练后方法（如监督微调）未能充分利用预训练获得的知识。

Method: 将FFN层视为关联键值记忆，并通过前向干预或反向传播正则化促进记忆向量的使用。

Result: 在15个下游任务中表现一致提升，模型能自适应分配信息，更关注语义有意义的标记。

Conclusion: 训练后阶段需更充分利用预训练潜力，潜在表示空间的干预是提升性能和可解释性的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

Motivation: 当前最强大的共情LSLM多为封闭系统，缺乏透明度，阻碍了共情行为的研究。OpenS2S旨在填补这一空白，提供完全开源的工具。

Method: 基于BLSP-Emo模型，采用流式交错解码架构实现低延迟语音生成；利用自动化数据构建管道，结合大语言模型和可控文本转语音系统生成多样化共情语音数据。

Result: OpenS2S实现了低延迟的共情语音生成，并构建了高质量、多样化的训练语料库，完全开源了模型、数据集和代码。

Conclusion: OpenS2S为共情语音系统研究提供了透明、可扩展的工具，有望推动该领域的创新。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等资源匮乏语言生成可靠的新闻解释至关重要，但目前缺乏自动化工具。

Method: 通过DPO和课程学习，将机器生成的解释与人类推理对齐，并使用事实核查的解释作为优选响应。引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化DPO损失函数。

Result: 实验证明该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（如Mistral、Llama、mBART等）。

Conclusion: 这一可扩展的方法有效应对错误信息，并将自动化解释生成扩展到资源匮乏语言。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种基于策略判别器的奖励建模方法，通过捕捉策略间的相对差异生成奖励信号，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，POLAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出POLAR预训练方法，训练奖励模型区分相同和不同策略，捕捉策略与目标策略的相对差异。

Result: POLAR显著提升性能，如STEM任务准确率从54.8%提升至81.0%，并展示强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR是开发通用强大奖励模型的有前景方向，具有高性能、强泛化和良好的扩展性。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Motivation: 研究LLM在上下文引导下的潜在漏洞，探索如何通过对话历史中的先前响应引导模型生成违规内容。

Method: 提出Response Attack方法，使用辅助LLM生成轻微有害响应，结合触发提示引导目标模型生成有害内容。

Result: 在8个开源和专有LLM上，Response Attack的攻击成功率高于7种现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过构建上下文感知的安全微调数据集，显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保留了模型能力。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估推理、规划和执行能力，而记忆能力（如记忆、更新和检索长期信息）缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 通过整合现有数据集和新构建的数据集，设计MemoryAgentBench基准，涵盖准确检索、测试时学习、长程理解和冲突解决四个核心能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在全面掌握四个记忆能力方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了进一步探索LLM代理全面记忆机制的必要性。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a

using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated

This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计系统指令（SIs）资源密集且效果不佳，现有自动化方法生成的非人类可读指令牺牲了可解释性。

Method: SI-Agent采用三个协作代理（Instructor Agent、Instruction Follower Agent和Feedback/Reward Agent）和迭代反馈循环优化SIs。

Conclusion: SI-Agent在性能和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡，有望推动LLM定制化和透明化，但计算成本和反馈可靠性仍需改进。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且成本高效的GraphRAG框架，通过依赖知识图谱构建和轻量级检索策略，显著降低了计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GraphRAG在知识图谱构建和检索中的高计算成本和延迟问题，以推动其在企业环境中的实际应用。

Method: 引入依赖知识图谱构建管道（无需LLM）和轻量级图检索策略（混合查询节点识别与一跳遍历）。

Result: 在SAP数据集上表现优于传统RAG基线（LLM-as-Judge提升15%，RAGAS提升4.35%），依赖构建方法达到LLM生成图谱94%性能。

Conclusion: 验证了GraphRAG在大规模企业应用中的可行性，具有低成本、可扩展性和领域适应性。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: CodeAgents是一个多代理提示框架，通过模块化伪代码提高规划和令牌效率，在多个基准测试中表现优于自然语言提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化提示策略局限于单代理、仅规划场景，且忽视令牌效率和多代理环境的可扩展性。

Method: 将代理交互的组件（任务、计划、反馈等）编码为模块化伪代码，结合控制结构和类型变量。

Result: 在GAIA、HotpotQA和VirtualHome基准测试中，规划性能提升3-36个百分点，令牌使用减少55-87%。

Conclusion: CodeAgents在多代理系统中实现了高效、可解释的规划，强调了令牌感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

Motivation: 现有动态文本属性图数据集文本质量差，缺乏针对生成任务的标准化评估，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出GDGB基准，包含高质量数据集，定义TDGG和IDGG任务，设计多维度评估指标，并开发GAG-General框架。

Result: 实验表明GDGB能严格评估TDGG和IDGG，揭示了结构与文本特征的交互作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为生成动态文本属性图研究提供了基础资源，推动了实际应用。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards

TL;DR: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模（如llama-8B）和真实数据集上展现出优于Transformer的性能，特别是在新任务推理能力上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Memory Mosaics在更大规模和真实数据集上的表现是否仍保持其优势。

Method: 将Memory Mosaics扩展到10B规模，训练1万亿token，并引入架构改进（Memory Mosaics v2），评估其在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度上的能力。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识学习上与Transformer相当，但在新任务推理能力上显著优于Transformer，且无法通过增加Transformer训练数据轻易复制。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2在大型语言模型规模上表现出色，尤其是在新任务推理能力上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

*Anand Gokhale,Vaibhav Srivastava,Francesco Bullo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的actor-critic架构，结合LLM的推理能力与形式逻辑的保证，用于长期规划任务，避免错误累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长期规划任务中因错误累积导致的不安全或低效行为问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为actor，LTLCrit作为critic，通过线性时序逻辑（LTL）生成约束，改进未来行为。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘任务中实现100%完成率，效率优于基线LLM规划器。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种强大且灵活的安全决策范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training
corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets
(query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000
neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured
knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We
employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the
FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective
optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric
learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset
comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates
substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and
biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical
importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented
RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对日常生活独立性和幸福感至关重要，但对视力障碍者来说，由于缺乏进度跟踪和上下文反馈的支持，烹饪仍然具有挑战性。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，以支持实时步骤跟踪。

Result: 在173个教学视频和12个真实无视觉烹饪会话中，对象状态显著提高了步骤预测的准确性，并揭示了影响性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: OSCAR为上下文感知辅助烹饪系统提供了技术流程、真实数据集和设计见解，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

Conclusion: DiaFORGE为企业级工具调用代理提供了可靠蓝图，并公开了相关数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究结构化输出与非结构化自然语言推理的性能差异，探索更优的推理方法。

Method: 引入iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化JSON与非结构化推理，并在多个基准测试中进行比较。

Result: 非结构化推理在MATH基准上相对性能提升18.90%，且零样本非结构化方法优于五样本结构化方法。

Conclusion: 非结构化推理在复杂问题中更具优势，需重新评估结构化格式的依赖性和系统组织方式。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

Conclusion: MESHAgents提供了一种可扩展的自动化方法，生成具有透明推理的临床相关成像表型，优于传统专家驱动方法。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Conclusion: 监督与控制的有效区分有助于AI系统的治理，但仍需进一步研究解决其局限性。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

### [164] [Benchmarking Vector, Graph and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines for Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03608)
*Sarat Ahmad,Zeinab Nezami,Maryam Hafeez,Syed Ali Raza Zaidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN架构中的表现，发现GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG优于传统RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在ORAN架构中，LLMs生成xApps和rApps时资源消耗高的问题，探索RAG方法的有效性。

Method: 使用ORAN规范对Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG进行对比评估，衡量生成指标。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现更优，Hybrid GraphRAG事实正确性提升8%，GraphRAG上下文相关性提升7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG在ORAN中具有潜力，可作为资源密集型微调的替代方案。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

TL;DR: EvoAgentX是一个开源平台，用于自动化生成、执行和进化优化多代理工作流，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统（MAS）框架需要手动配置工作流，缺乏动态进化和性能优化的原生支持，且优化算法未统一集成。

Method: EvoAgentX采用模块化架构，包含五个核心层：基础组件、代理、工作流、进化和评估层，并集成了三种优化算法（TextGrad、AFlow、MIPRO）。

Result: 在HotPotQA、MBPP、MATH和GAIA任务中，EvoAgentX显著提升了性能，如HotPotQA F1提高7.44%，MBPP pass@1提升10.00%。

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化工作流生成和优化，有效解决了MAS框架的动态进化和性能优化问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

Motivation: 现有贝叶斯逆向规划模型在复杂场景下扩展性不足，而LLMs在ToM任务中表现不稳定。结合两者优势，提升模型性能。

Method: 使用LLMs生成假设和似然函数，结合贝叶斯逆向规划模型计算后验概率，预测代理的心理状态。

Result: 混合方法在ToM任务中表现优于单独使用LLMs或贝叶斯模型，且适用于开放任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为ToM模型的未来发展提供了新方向，有望提升生成代理的社会智能。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large
language models (LLMs) as a mechanism for generating hypotheses and likelihood
functions with a Bayesian inverse planning model that computes posterior
probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的神经符号推理框架Tunsr，用于知识图谱推理，解决了现有方法无法有效结合神经和符号推理优势以及适应多样化推理场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱推理在人工智能和知识工程领域具有重要意义，但现有方法未能有效结合神经和符号推理的优势，且难以适应多样化推理场景的需求。

Conclusion: Tunsr成功统一了神经和符号推理方法，并适应多样化推理场景，为知识图谱推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM问答系统在多轮交互中可能因上下文推理而显得繁琐，需改进以自动解决提问中的不完整或模糊问题。

Method: 采用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，通过分类、解决和回答三个动作处理提问缺陷。

Result: 实验显示代理能缩短交互时间、提高答案质量，并解释问题缺陷的解决过程，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 基于代理的方法能构建更健壮的问答系统，尤其在提问缺乏足够上下文时效果显著。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Result: LLMs在跨学科研究中可作为辅助工具，通过迭代交互促进协作，加速科学发现。

Conclusion: 在人类监督下负责任地使用LLMs，将推动跨学科研究的创新与科学进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于视觉的神经进化在缺乏API支持或明确状态表示的游戏环境中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Result: 代理实现94.9%知识召回率，反馈分数与外部文献评分强相关，无需直接访问专家即可恢复信息。

Conclusion: 代理能有效应对组织复杂性，捕获碎片化知识，提升隐性知识记录效率。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Method: 使用RELRaE框架，通过LLMs分阶段提取和标注XML模式中的隐含关系。

Result: LLMs能有效生成关系标签，支持半自动本体生成框架。

Conclusion: LLMs在实验室自动化和半自动本体生成中具有重要价值。

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于经济约束的LLM评估框架，将性能权衡量化为单一数值，发现推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法无法比较具有不同优缺点的LLM的问题，如低成本高错误率模型与高成本高准确率模型的对比。

Method: 提出经济评估框架，将性能权衡量化为基于具体用例经济约束的单一数值（如错误成本、延迟成本等）。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；单一大模型在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先使用最强大的模型，而非最小化部署成本，因为错误的经济影响远大于部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统难以处理教育场景中的多样性和模糊性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了Uni-Retrieval模块和Uni-RAG框架，结合多模态检索和指令调优语言模型。

Result: 实验表明Uni-RAG在检索准确性和生成质量上优于基线系统，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持个性化学习。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

*Rahil P Mehta,Yashwanthi Anand,Manish Motwani,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIProbe是一种黑盒测试技术，通过差异测试区分自主代理行为错误是源于代理缺陷还是环境不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理及其环境复杂性增加，识别行为错误来源变得困难但至关重要。

Method: AIProbe生成多样化环境配置和任务，使用拉丁超立方采样，并通过独立于代理的搜索规划器解决任务，比较代理与规划器表现。

Result: AIProbe在多个领域中显著优于现有技术，能检测更多总错误和独特错误。

Conclusion: AIProbe有助于可靠部署自主代理，有效区分代理缺陷与环境不可行性。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

### [180] [LLMs model how humans induce logically structured rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03876)
*Alyssa Loo,Ellie Pavlick,Roman Feiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了神经网络（特别是大型语言模型LLMs）是否能作为认知科学的计算模型，通过实验证明LLMs在解释人类逻辑概念方面优于或至少等同于贝叶斯概率思维语言模型（pLoT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证神经网络（尤其是LLMs）是否能有效解释人类认知的原始表征和计算规则，尤其是在抽象认知功能（如语言和逻辑）领域。

Method: 通过四个实验，测试多种LLMs在逻辑规则归纳任务中的表现，并与pLoT模型进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在拟合人类行为方面至少与pLoT模型相当，且其预测的规则性质与pLoT不同，表明LLMs并非pLoT的简单实现。

Conclusion: LLMs可能提供了一种新的理论框架，用于解释人类逻辑概念的原始表征和计算，未来认知科学研究应关注这一方向。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

*Yingxuan Yang,Ying Wen,Jun Wang,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Agent Exchange（AEX），一个专为AI代理经济设计的拍卖平台，旨在支持代理间的价值交换和协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展，AI代理从被动工具转变为自主经济参与者，需要新的基础设施支持其经济活动。

Method: AEX借鉴在线广告的实时竞价（RTB）系统，设计了包含用户侧平台（USP）、代理侧平台（ASP）、代理中心和数据管理平台（DMP）的架构。

Result: AEX为AI代理经济提供了优化的协调和参与基础设施。

Conclusion: AEX为未来基于代理的经济生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed AI agents from
passive computational tools into autonomous economic actors. This shift marks
the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active
economic roles-exchanging value, making strategic decisions, and coordinating
actions with minimal human oversight. To realize this vision, we propose Agent
Exchange (AEX), a specialized auction platform designed to support the dynamics
of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

*Yifan Jiang,Yibo Xue,Yukun Kang,Pin Zheng,Jian Peng,Feiran Wu,Changliang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个公开的幻灯片动画数据集，并通过LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型，显著提升了动画生成任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏动画支持，且视觉语言模型在动画任务上表现不佳，主要由于缺少公开数据集和时间推理能力不足。

Method: 发布了包含12,000组自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并使用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L、SPICE和CODA指标上优于GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro，尤其在CODA细节上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来基于VLM的动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

*Yiliu Sun,Zicheng Zhao,Sheng Wan,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CortexDebate提出了一种新的多智能体辩论方法，通过稀疏辩论图和信任评估模块解决现有方法的输入过长和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一大语言模型存在幻觉和推理能力不足的问题，现有多智能体辩论方法面临输入过长和过度自信的挑战。

Method: 提出CortexDebate方法，构建稀疏辩论图，并引入McKinsey-based Debate Matter模块优化图结构。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上验证了CortexDebate的有效性。

Conclusion: CortexDebate通过稀疏辩论图和信任评估显著提升了多智能体辩论的效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

### [184] [An ASP-Based Framework for MUSes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03929)
*Mohimenul Kabir,Kuldeep S Meel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUS-ASP是一个基于答案集编程的框架，用于在线枚举最小不可满足子集（MUS），显著提升了枚举和计数任务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不可满足公式的核心原因是许多应用中的关键问题，而MUS是捕捉这一点的有效方式。当前研究集中在枚举和计数MUS上，但需要更高效的方法。

Method: 通过将MUS枚举问题转化为答案集求解问题，利用ASP的知识表示和计算效率优势，设计了MUS-ASP框架。

Result: 实验表明，MUS-ASP在MUS枚举和计数任务中表现出色，尤其是在混合求解器中集成时。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP是一个高效的工具，特别适用于复杂组合问题的MUS枚举和计数。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

### [185] [Toward Better Generalisation in Uncertainty Estimators: Leveraging Data-Agnostic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03998)
*Thuy An Ha,Bao Quoc Vo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征和隐藏状态特征来提升大语言模型（LLMs）在跨域任务中的不确定性量化性能，但结果并不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常生成高自信但事实错误的回答，需改进其不确定性量化方法以提升可靠性。

Method: 结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征，并筛选最有信息量的隐藏状态特征，评估其对跨域性能的影响。

Result: 引入数据无关特征通常能提升性能，但在某些情况下会降低效果；筛选隐藏状态特征也未一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 数据无关特征的作用受限于训练探针对其权重的分配，导致结果不一致，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多领域表现出色，但在复杂多目标优化等问题上仍有局限，需要结合其他方法提升性能。

Method: 提出Lyria框架，结合LLMs的语义理解和遗传算法的全局搜索能力，包含7个核心组件。

Result: 通过4种LLMs和3类问题的实验验证了Lyria的有效性，并通过7项消融实验分析了性能影响因素。

Conclusion: Lyria框架成功结合了LLMs和遗传算法的优势，为解决复杂问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities
across various domains, they still struggle with complex problems characterized
by multi-objective optimization, precise constraint satisfaction, immense
solution spaces, etc. To address the limitation, drawing on the superior
semantic understanding ability of LLMs and also the outstanding global search
and optimization capability of genetic algorithms, we propose to capitalize on
their respective strengths and introduce Lyria, a general LLM-driven genetic
algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its
performance.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了J1-ENVS和J1-EVAL，用于评估LLM在动态法律环境中的表现，发现现有模型在程序执行上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态基准与动态法律实践之间的差距，推动法律智能的发展。

Method: 开发了J1-ENVS（动态法律环境）和J1-EVAL（评估框架），并在17个LLM代理上进行实验。

Result: 许多模型在法律知识上表现良好，但在动态环境中的程序执行上表现不佳，GPT-4o总体表现低于60%。

Conclusion: 动态法律智能仍面临挑战，需进一步研究。

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

TL;DR: HAWK是一个模块化框架，解决多智能体系统的互操作性、任务调度和资源共享问题，通过分层设计和标准化接口提升效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统在跨平台互操作性、动态任务调度和资源共享方面存在挑战，缺乏标准化接口和动态调度策略。

Method: HAWK框架包含五层（用户、工作流、操作、智能体、资源）和16个标准化接口，支持任务解析、工作流编排、智能调度等。

Result: 通过CreAgentive原型验证，HAWK提高了吞吐量、降低了调用复杂度，并增强了系统可控性。

Conclusion: HAWK展示了在多领域的应用潜力，未来研究方向包括幻觉缓解和实时性能优化。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的网页代理训练方法，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）优化计算资源分配，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源LLM网页代理性能落后于闭源系统，主要由于单步任务局限性和高计算成本。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先用监督微调（SFT）训练学生模型模仿教师模型，再进行策略强化学习（RL）。通过1,370种配置采样和自举法优化超参数。

Result: 结合SFT和RL的方法在WorkArena和MiniWob++上表现优于单独使用任一方法，且计算成本仅为纯SFT的55%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了性能并降低了计算成本，缩小了与闭源模型的差距。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for
aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical
challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning
capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration
of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally,
it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced
strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across
domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also
present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms,
and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains
dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly
improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward
hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the
need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions,
including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective
alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing
RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and

Motivation: 探索LLM训练中学习率调度策略（WSD）的机理，减少对启发式方法的依赖。

Method: 利用热力学类比分析损失景观，提出‘山谷-河流’模型，推导最优学习率条件。

Result: 发现‘强Mpemba点’能加速收敛，为学习率调度提供理论支持。

Conclusion: 为LLM学习率调度提供了理论依据，减少超参数调优需求。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

TL;DR: ASPMT是ASP与SMT紧密结合的新框架，类似于一阶逻辑与SMT的关系，通过固定背景理论的解释实现。它可将“紧密”ASPMT程序转换为SMT实例，并应用于增强动作语言C+以处理连续和离散变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将ASP与SMT结合，以支持更复杂的逻辑推理，特别是处理连续变化和离散变化的动作语言。

Method: 基于功能稳定模型语义，固定背景理论的解释，并将ASPMT程序转换为SMT实例。

Result: 成功将ASPMT应用于动作语言C+，使其能处理连续变化，并利用SMT求解器计算语言语义。

Conclusion: ASPMT为逻辑编程与理论推理的结合提供了新途径，尤其在处理连续资源累积效应方面表现出色。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

*Xingyang He,Xiao Ling,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartThinker提出了一种两阶段学习框架，通过细粒度控制推理链长度，减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在冗余和低效问题，现有方法通过全局长度惩罚导致关键步骤压缩不足或简单步骤保留冗余细节。

Method: SmartThinker采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过拒绝采样和监督微调适应短形式推理；第二阶段通过SCPO优化模型输出分布，实现步骤级长度控制。

Result: 实验表明，SmartThinker在多个推理基准和骨干模型上显著减少冗余推理，性能与现有方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: SmartThinker通过细粒度长度控制，有效平衡了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

TL;DR: WebSynthesis框架通过虚拟环境模拟解决LLM代理在复杂动态网页环境中的轨迹规划和执行问题，减少API成本和环境不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在不可控环境状态和高API成本方面的挑战，以实现代理的可扩展自我改进。

Method: 利用学习的世界模型模拟虚拟网页环境，支持基于树的高效可逆规划，生成多样化高质量轨迹。

Result: 在小规模合成数据集上训练的代理性能媲美或超越基于大规模真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: WebSynthesis为代理的自我改进提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Method: MOD-X提出了一种分层架构，包括通用消息总线、状态管理、翻译能力和基于区块链的安全机制。

Result: MOD-X通过发布-订阅通信模型、语义能力发现和动态工作流编排，实现了异构智能体的无缝集成。

Conclusion: MOD-X为去中心化、可扩展的智能体生态系统提供了理论与实践结合的解决方案。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

### [199] [DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381)
*Bing Fan,Shusen Ma,Yun-Bo Zhao,Yu Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DC-Mamber是一种基于Mamba和线性Transformer的双通道时间序列预测模型，结合了通道独立和通道混合策略，克服了现有模型的局限性，并在实验中表现出优越的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Transformer和Mamba）在时间序列预测中存在局限性：Transformer对局部时间模式不敏感且计算复杂度高，而Mamba难以并行聚合全局上下文信息。因此，需要一种结合两者优势的模型。

Method: 提出DC-Mamber模型，使用Mamba通道（通道独立策略）提取变量内特征，线性Transformer通道（通道混合策略）建模全局依赖。通过双通道特征融合进行预测。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验表明，DC-Mamber的准确性优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber通过结合Mamba和线性Transformer的优势，有效解决了时间序列预测中的局部和全局依赖问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需额外训练即可提升多种大语言模型在多个基准上的事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合利用标记和层次信号，有效提升了生成内容的事实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARMR能提供更个性化和准确的药物推荐，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in

human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language

then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

Result: Deja Vu以抽象和空间语言为特征，非自愿自传体记忆富含个人情感细节，意外思维表现为不可预测性和认知干扰。

Conclusion: 语言能深入揭示自发认知状态的表现，支持并更新现有理论。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Result: Monty表现出强大的泛化能力、快速推理速度和高效学习能力，优于现有深度学习架构。

Conclusion: 千脑系统是一种有前景的新AI方法，Monty的初步成果验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Result: 实验证明Rec-APC在用户类型多或与内容类别相当时优于POMDP求解器SARSOP。

Conclusion: Rec-APC为聚合偏好数据下的决策提供了新思路，适用于隐私保护场景。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

Result: PETs集成最高可降低攻击风险49.47%，同时保持模型效用和解释质量。

Conclusion: PETs在XAI中可有效防御隐私攻击，需权衡效用与隐私保护。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Result: 实证研究表明，该框架适用于生物和人工智能系统，实现了抽象理论与实际应用的结合。

Conclusion: “核心与外围”原则为智能系统的工程化提供了新的理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

TL;DR: MoPPS是一种贝叶斯风险预测框架，通过迭代近似评估和自适应提示选择，减少LLM推理调用，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调LLM时，频繁的提示评估和策略更新导致高计算成本，需要更高效的提示选择方法。

Method: 提出MoPPS框架，通过贝叶斯推理建模提示成功率，结合多臂老虎机实现样本高效的自适应提示选择。

Result: 实验表明，MoPPS能可靠预测提示难度，显著减少LLM调用并加速训练。

Conclusion: MoPPS提供了一种计算高效的提示选择方法，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“特洛伊木马提示”的新型越狱技术，利用对话历史中的不对称安全对齐漏洞，通过伪造模型的过去对话来绕过安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是发现对话式AI在依赖对话历史进行推理时，存在未探索的攻击面，尤其是模型对其自身过去对话的信任可能导致安全漏洞。

Method: 方法是通过伪造模型过去的对话内容，将恶意负载注入模型生成的消息中，再通过良性用户提示触发有害内容生成。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在攻击成功率（ASR）上显著高于传统用户轮次越狱方法。

Conclusion: 结论揭示了现代对话式AI安全的根本缺陷，需要从输入级过滤转向协议级的对话上下文完整性验证。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

TL;DR: LumiCRS是一个端到端框架，通过动态调整损失函数、原型学习和对话增强模块，解决对话推荐系统中的长尾分布问题，显著提高了推荐的准确性、多样性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRSs）中存在极端长尾分布问题，导致推荐偏向热门内容，牺牲多样性和加剧冷启动问题。

Method: 提出LumiCRS框架，包含自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）、原型学习和GPT-4o驱动的对话增强模块，分别解决头部过拟合、表示漂移和尾部稀疏问题。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10比基线提高了7-15%，人类评估也显示其流畅性、信息量和长尾相关性更优。

Conclusion: LumiCRS通过多层协作有效解决了长尾问题，提升了对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1是一个基于分层奖励的强化学习框架，用于训练LLM生成功能正确且PPA优化的RTL代码，在标准基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法同时优化功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需要一种能结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈进行训练。

Result: 在RTLLM基准测试中，生成的27个RTL设计超越了人工编写的PPA指标。

Conclusion: ChipSeek-R1展示了将工具链反馈整合到LLM训练中的有效性，强化学习有望实现自动化生成超越人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Activation-Steered Compression (ASC)的技术，通过调整模型的隐藏表示来压缩推理链，减少冗长性，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理时生成的中间步骤（CoTs）通常过于冗长，导致资源浪费和延迟增加。

Method: 通过提取和注入“转向向量”来调整模型的激活空间，实现推理链的压缩，无需重新训练。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上，ASC实现了67.43%的推理链长度压缩，同时保持准确性，并带来2.73倍的推理速度提升。

Conclusion: ASC是一种无需训练的高效方法，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的推理场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Result: 在真实HVAC数据和专家标注数据集上表现优异，优于基线方法，提供高准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: JARVIS有效解决了HVAC系统交互的独特挑战，为实时、准确的QA交互提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and
requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore
how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Conclusion: LLMs在交通事故影响预测中具有实际可行性。

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Conclusion: DoPI系统有效提升了中医诊断的对话能力和专业性，为医疗AI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

TL;DR: MARBLE是一种多智能体规则驱动的LLM引擎，通过分解任务和模块化推理，显著提高了交通事故严重性预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通事故严重性预测因数据不完整、特征依赖性强和类别不平衡而困难，现有方法在噪声环境中表现不佳且缺乏可解释性。

Method: MARBLE采用多智能体协作，每个智能体专注于特定特征子集，通过规则或LLM引导的共识机制协调预测，并保留推理痕迹。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE准确率接近90%，显著优于传统方法和SOTA提示推理方法（如CoT、L2M、ToT）。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Method: 提出了双任务自回归模仿学习（DARIL）基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL在动作三元组识别和下一帧预测中表现最佳（34.6%和33.6% mAP），而所有RL方法均表现不佳（最低3.1% mAP）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在专家标注测试集上，IL优于RL，挑战了RL在序列决策中优越性的假设，为手术AI发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可作为因果建模和干预预测的有效框架。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出GIST模型解决跨域点击率预测中的数据稀疏和冷启动问题，通过解耦源域和目标域训练，结合内容-行为联合训练模块和非对称相似性集成策略，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在工业场景中因分布差异和持续数据更新导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出GIST模型，包含内容-行为联合训练模块（CBJT）和非对称相似性集成策略（ASI），解耦源域和目标域训练。

Result: 在离线和在线测试中超越现有方法，成功部署于小红书平台，服务数亿用户。

Conclusion: GIST通过创新模块和策略有效提升跨域点击率预测性能，适用于大规模工业场景。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare
applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to
healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of
healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical
vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma
demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong
foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to

Method: 设计X-Master代理，以代码为交互语言，结合Python库和定制工具增强推理能力，并通过X-Masters工作流扩展其广度与深度。

Result: X-Masters在HLE测试中以32.1%的成绩刷新记录，超越OpenAI和Google的Deep Research。

Conclusion: X-Masters为复杂任务解决提供了新思路，并为未来模型训练积累了经验。

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Motivation: 在异构团队（如人机协作）中，实时适应队友策略对任务成功至关重要，尤其是在时间压力和复杂策略空间下。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习策略的潜在空间，聚类识别策略类型，训练条件合作者，并通过遗憾最小化算法动态适应新队友。

Result: 在Overcooked环境测试中，TALENTS优于现有基线，尤其在适应陌生人类队友时表现突出。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架有效支持异构团队的实时策略适应，提升了协作任务的性能。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决CoT监控在防止严重危害时的可靠性问题，尤其是针对其作为后合理化工具时的不可靠性。

Method: 通过区分CoT-as-rationalization和CoT-as-computation，并增加实验难度以强制模型暴露推理过程，从而测试其监控性。

Result: 研究发现模型可以学会隐藏意图，但需要大量帮助（如详细的人类策略或针对监控的迭代优化）。

Conclusion: 结论是CoT监控虽非完美，但仍是一个重要的防御层，需要持续的压力测试和保护。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

Motivation: 急诊科患者分诊工具（如ESI）需要改进，机器学习可提升分诊效率和准确性。

Method: 使用模拟退火（SA）和自适应模拟退火（ASA）优化XGB和CaB的超参数，并与传统网格搜索（GS）对比。

Result: ASA-CaB在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数上均表现最佳，分别为83.3%、83.2%、83.3%、83.2%。

Conclusion: ASA-CaB是一种高效的电子分诊工具优化方法，优于其他算法。

Abstract: Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在为临床NLP应用提供一种隐私保护和部署高效的替代方案，特别适合分布式医疗环境。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集，结合六种公开嵌入模型和三种MLP分类器架构，在集中式和联邦式配置下进行实验。

Result: 嵌入质量对预测性能的影响远大于分类器复杂度，联邦学习在理想条件下可接近集中式结果。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了可扩展且隐私保护的医疗编码系统的可行性，为未来联邦学习和领域自适应临床AI研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning
(FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the
MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training
or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable
pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and
deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly
suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both
centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly
available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard
and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits
assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially
outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that
federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized
conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than
state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1
scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the
simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way
toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step
toward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RDiffBR的模型无关生成框架，用于解决动态变化的bundle-item关联问题，通过残差扩散模型提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有bundle推荐模型在动态变化的bundle-item关联场景下性能波动或下降，需要一种适应动态变化的解决方案。

Method: 提出RDiffBR框架，利用残差扩散模型处理bundle嵌入，通过前向-反向过程生成有效的item-level bundle嵌入。

Result: 在六个BR模型和四个公开数据集上，RDiffBR将召回率和NDCG提升高达23%，训练时间仅增加约4%。

Conclusion: RDiffBR是一种高效的模型无关框架，能显著提升BR模型在动态变化场景下的性能。

Abstract: Existing solutions for bundle recommendation(BR) have achieved remarkable
effectiveness for predicting the user's preference for prebuilt bundles.
However, bundle-item(B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios.
For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit', may add 'hat' or remove
'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user pes or
inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of
mainstream BR models will fluctuate or even decline regarding item-level
variability. This paper makes the first attempt to referencaddress the above
problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle
Recommendation(RDiffBR) as a model-agnostic generative framework which can
assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the
BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level
bundle embeddings which are generated by BR model to represent bundle theme via
a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level
bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I
variability scenarios to generate the effective item-level bundle embeddings.
In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator
significantly enhances item-level bundle embeddings generation ability of BR
models. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different
domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of
backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increased training time about
4%.Codes and datasets are available at

Abstract: Conversational agents such as Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini assist
users with complex search tasks but often generate misleading or fabricated

completing their complex task. We outline key challenges and future research
directions to advance XIR in this domain.

Motivation: POI推荐系统常因流行度偏差而影响效果，本文旨在评估上下文感知模型和校准流行度技术对减少偏差的有效性。

Method: 使用四个真实POI数据集（Brightkite、Foursquare、Gowalla和Yelp），分析上下文感知模型和校准技术的单独及组合效果。

Result: 上下文感知模型对准确性和偏差的影响不一致，而校准技术能有效对齐推荐与用户偏好；两者结合可平衡准确性和流行度校准。

Conclusion: 校准技术是减少流行度偏差的有效方法，结合上下文感知模型能更好地平衡推荐系统的准确性和用户偏好。

Abstract: Point-of-interest (POI) recommender systems help users discover relevant
locations, but their effectiveness is often compromised by popularity bias,
which disadvantages less popular, yet potentially meaningful places. This paper
addresses this challenge by evaluating the effectiveness of context-aware
models and calibrated popularity techniques as strategies for mitigating
popularity bias. Using four real-world POI datasets (Brightkite, Foursquare,
Gowalla, and Yelp), we analyze the individual and combined effects of these
approaches on recommendation accuracy and popularity bias. Our results reveal
that context-aware models cannot be considered a uniform solution, as the
models studied exhibit divergent impacts on accuracy and bias. In contrast,
calibration techniques can effectively align recommendation popularity with
user preferences, provided there is a careful balance between accuracy and bias
mitigation. Notably, the combination of calibration and context-awareness
yields recommendations that balance accuracy and close alignment with the
users' popularity profiles, i.e., popularity calibration.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于数字档案，还可推广到其他推荐系统领域，尤其是那些价值通过持续参与而非即时消费体现的领域。

Abstract: This paper presents the first multistakeholder approach for translating
diverse stakeholder values into an evaluation metric setup for Recommender
Systems (RecSys) in digital archives. While commercial platforms mainly rely on
engagement metrics, cultural heritage domains require frameworks that balance
competing priorities among archivists, platform owners, researchers, and other
stakeholders. To address this challenge, we conducted high-profile focus groups
(5 groups x 5 persons) with upstream, provider, system, consumer, and
downstream stakeholders, identifying value priorities across critical
dimensions: visibility/representation, expertise adaptation, and
transparency/trust. Our analysis shows that stakeholder concerns naturally
align with four sequential research funnel stages: discovery, interaction,
integration, and impact. The resulting framework addresses domain-specific
challenges including collection representation imbalances, non-linear research
patterns, and tensions between specialized expertise and broader accessibility.
We propose tailored metrics for each stage in this research journey, such as
research path quality for discovery, contextual appropriateness for
interaction, metadata-weighted relevance for integration, and cross-stakeholder
value alignment for impact assessment. Our contributions extend beyond digital
archives to the broader RecSys community, offering transferable evaluation
approaches for domains where value emerges through sustained engagement rather
than immediate consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成推荐（GenRec）虽具潜力，但存在暴露偏差和长尾项目泛化不足的问题，现有研究未充分关注。

Method: 提出GENPLUGIN框架，采用双编码器-共享解码器架构，通过对比学习对齐语言和ID视图，并引入概率替换策略和检索数据增强机制。

Result: 实验表明，GENPLUGIN显著缓解了暴露偏差，并提升了长尾项目推荐质量。

Conclusion: GENPLUGIN为生成推荐系统提供了有效的改进方案，解决了关键问题。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GenRec) offers LLM integration, reduced embedding
costs, and eliminates per-candidate scoring, attracting great attention.
Despite its promising performance, this study reveals that it suffers from
generation exposure bias and poor long-tail item generalization, two critical
limitations overlooked by prior works on GenRec. To address these, we propose
GENPLUGIN, a plug-and-play framework featuring a dual-encoder, shared-decoder
architecture. During pre-training, it aligns language and ID views via
contrastive learning, harmonizing item representations across two complementary
views. Besides, GENPLUGIN uses a novel training strategy that probabilistically
substitutes ground-truth item ID tokens with predictions from the
language-semantics encoder, alleviating exposure bias. To improve long-tail
generative recommendation, we propose a retrieval-based data augmentation
mechanism. It fine-tunes the decoder of GENPLUGIN to endow GENPLUGIN with the
ability to use relevant users w.r.t. contexts or collaborative information to
augment the generation of item ID tokens in long-tail recommendation scenarios.
We have plugged GENPLUGIN into several representative GenRec models and the
extensive experiments demonstrate that GENPLUGIN can notably mitigate
generation exposure bias during item ID generation while significantly
improving the quality of long-tail item recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在XMTC任务中，标签的长尾分布（高频头部标签和低频尾部标签）导致模型难以在所有标签上保持平衡效果。稀疏和密集检索方法的互补性为解决这一问题提供了可能性。

Method: 通过结合稀疏检索器（如BM25）和密集检索器（如微调BERT）的预测，利用基于排名的融合算法，将稀疏检索器的精确匹配能力与密集检索器的语义丰富性相结合。

Result: 融合方法生成的最终排名提高了对头部和尾部标签的分类效果。

Conclusion: 结合稀疏和密集检索方法的融合策略能够有效解决XMTC中的标签长尾分布问题，提升整体分类性能。

Abstract: In the context of Extreme Multi-label Text Classification (XMTC), where
labels are assigned to text instances from a large label space, the long-tail
distribution of labels presents a significant challenge. Labels can be broadly
categorized into frequent, high-coverage \textbf{head labels} and infrequent,
low-coverage \textbf{tail labels}, complicating the task of balancing
effectiveness across all labels. To address this, combining predictions from
multiple retrieval methods, such as sparse retrievers (e.g., BM25) and dense
retrievers (e.g., fine-tuned BERT), offers a promising solution. The fusion of
\textit{sparse} and \textit{dense} retrievers is motivated by the complementary
ranking characteristics of these methods. Sparse retrievers compute relevance
scores based on high-dimensional, bag-of-words representations, while dense
retrievers utilize approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms on dense text
and label embeddings within a shared embedding space. Rank-based fusion
algorithms leverage these differences by combining the precise matching
capabilities of sparse retrievers with the semantic richness of dense
retrievers, thereby producing a final ranking that improves the effectiveness

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems commonly use transformer-based models
for next-item prediction. While these models demonstrate a strong balance
between efficiency and quality, integrating interleaving features - such as the
query context (e.g., browse category) under which next-item interactions occur
- poses challenges. Effectively capturing query context is crucial for refining
ranking relevance and enhancing user engagement, as it provides valuable
signals about user intent within a session. Unlike an item's features, query
context is not temporally aligned with the item sequence, making its
incorporation into transformers challenging and error-prone. This paper
analyzes different strategies for incorporating query context into transformers
trained with a causal language modeling procedure as a case study. We propose a
new method that effectively fuses the item sequence with query context within
the attention mechanism. Through extensive offline and online experiments on a
large-scale online platform and open datasets, we present evidence that our
proposed method is an effective approach for integrating query context to
improve model ranking quality in terms of relevance and diversity.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems operate in uniquely dynamic settings: user
interests, item pools, and popularity trends shift continuously, and models
must adapt in real time without forgetting past preferences. While existing
tutorials on continual or lifelong learning cover broad machine learning
domains (e.g., vision and graphs), they do not address recommendation-specific
demands-such as balancing stability and plasticity per user, handling
cold-start items, and optimizing recommendation metrics under streaming
feedback. This tutorial aims to make a timely contribution by filling that gap.
We begin by reviewing the background and problem settings, followed by a
comprehensive overview of existing approaches. We then highlight recent efforts
to apply continual learning to practical deployment environments, such as
resource-constrained systems and sequential interaction settings. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and future research directions. We expect this tutorial
to benefit researchers and practitioners in recommender systems, data mining,
AI, and information retrieval across academia and industry.

Motivation: 特征交互建模对推荐模型至关重要，但现有方法通常仅选择单个特征，而高阶特征组合选择因计算复杂度高而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出泰勒展开评分器（TayScorer）和逻辑回归消除（LRE）技术，前者通过梯度近似评估特征组合重要性，后者减少信息冗余。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性和效率，在线A/B测试证明了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: TayFCS是一种高效且实用的特征组合选择方法，显著提升了推荐模型性能。

Abstract: Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A
common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to
enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these
combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful
feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While
feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically
limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for
high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due
to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature
combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{TayFCS}$, a
lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves
model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer
(TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead
of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly
running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to
approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can
be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation
model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and
their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which
estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction
performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test
results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于用户行为日志或LLM的互补关系标签存在模糊性和不一致性，需要更清晰的定义和方法。

Method: 引入FBLs作为互补关系的新定义，构建人工标注的数据集，并评估ML模型和LLM在标签推断中的表现。

Result: ML模型（如逻辑回归和SVM）在有限数据下表现优异（macro-F1约0.82），LLM（如gpt-4o-mini）与人类判断高度一致（一致性0.989，准确率0.849）。

Conclusion: FBLs为互补关系提供了清晰定义，提升了推荐系统的准确性和自动化标注能力。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations enhance the user experience by suggesting items
that are frequently purchased together while serving different functions from
the query item. Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary
relationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining
these labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such
relationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs
attempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and
unreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs)
to infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary
classification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships.
In this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels
(FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user
purchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a
human-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that
it covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then
evaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could
accurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated
complementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that
even with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve
high macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as
gpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy
(0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as
effective annotators that mimic human judgment. Overall, our study presents
FBLs as a clear definition of complementary relationships, enabling more
accurate inferences and automated labeling of complementary recommendations.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在任务特定适应后对检索能力的影响，以开发能够处理多模态内容的统一检索器。

Method: 使用八种Qwen2.5 7B LLMs（包括基础模型、指令调优模型、代码/数学专业化模型等），在零样本和监督设置下进行实验，评估其在文本和代码检索任务中的表现。

Result: 数学专业化和长推理能力导致检索性能下降，而视觉语言模型和代码专业化模型在零样本检索中表现优于其他模型，甚至超过BM25。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用跨领域和跨模态融合的统一检索任务提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense
retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval
effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines
how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities,
an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling
text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments
with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned,
code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across
zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot
retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code
retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance,
all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical
specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation
in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and
semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs
demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even
surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance
to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising
directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and
cross-modal fusion.

Result: 在Amazon数据集上，MuSiC表现优于所有基线模型，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MuSiC通过多模态和侧用户的有效利用，显著提升了跨域推荐的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start
problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on
transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the
target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the
underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain
alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target
domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space
distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal
data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first
employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features
and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt
learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion
module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This
approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and
understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping
users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature
vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of
cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the
Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available:

Abstract: Generating effective query suggestions in conversational search requires
aligning model outputs with user preferences, which is challenging due to
sparse and noisy click signals. We propose GQS, a generative framework that
integrates click modeling and preference optimization to enhance real-world
user engagement. GQS consists of three key components: (1) a Multi-Source CTR
Modeling module that captures diverse contextual signals to estimate
fine-grained click-through rates; (2) a Diversity-Aware Preference Alignment
strategy using CTR-weighted Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which
balances relevance and semantic diversity; and (3) a CTR-Calibrated Iterative
Optimization process that jointly refines the CTR and generation models across
training rounds. Experiments on two real-world tasks demonstrate that GQS
outperforms strong baselines in CTR, relevance, and diversity.

Conclusion: BiFair有效解决了LLM-enhanced RSs中的公平性问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model-enhanced Recommender Systems (LLM-enhanced RSs) have
emerged as a powerful approach to improving recommendation quality by
leveraging LLMs to generate item representations. Despite these advancements,
the integration of LLMs raises severe fairness concerns. Existing studies
reveal that LLM-based RSs exhibit greater unfairness than traditional RSs, yet
fairness issues in LLM-enhanced RSs remain largely unexplored. In this paper,
our empirical study reveals that while LLM-enhanced RSs improve fairness across
item groups, a significant fairness gap persists. Further enhancement remains
challenging due to the architectural differences and varying sources of
unfairness inherent in LLM-enhanced RSs. To bridge this gap, we first decompose
unfairness into i) \textit{prior unfairness} in LLM-generated representations
and ii) \textit{training unfairness} in recommendation models. Then, we propose
BiFair, a bi-level optimization-based fairness-aware training framework
designed to mitigate both prior and training unfairness simultaneously. BiFair
optimizes two sets of learnable parameters: LLM-generated representations and a
trainable projector in the recommendation model, using a two-level nested
optimization process. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive inter-group
balancing mechanism, leveraging multi-objective optimization principles to
dynamically balance fairness across item groups. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that BiFair significantly mitigates unfairness
and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Result: HIPHOP在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIPHOP通过结合语义学习和意图引导优化，有效提升了会话推荐的性能。

Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will
likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous
session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,
ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some
methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and
irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on
item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their
ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable
LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.
First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models
(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item
embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item
transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing
module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we
design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user
intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively
exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an
intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.
Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive
learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available:

Conclusion: HUM方法显著提升了开放域推荐的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has demonstrated
notable success in various domains, showcasing their potential for open-domain
recommendation. A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in
effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors
across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and
semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to
compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To
address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM)
method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for
LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to
compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking
mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The
robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain
seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on
heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity
by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance
in open-domain recommendation.

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems face significant challenges in processing
multimodal sequential data, particularly in temporal dynamics modeling and
information flow coordination. Traditional approaches struggle with
distribution discrepancies between heterogeneous features and noise
interference in multimodal signals. We propose \textbf{FindRec}~
(\textbf{F}lexible unified \textbf{in}formation \textbf{d}isentanglement for

"information flow-control-output" paradigm. The framework features two key
innovations: (1) A Stein kernel-based Integrated Information Coordination
Module (IICM) that theoretically guarantees distribution consistency between
multimodal features and ID streams, and (2) A cross-modal expert routing
mechanism that adaptively filters and combines multimodal features based on
their contextual relevance. Our approach leverages multi-head subspace
decomposition for routing stability and RBF-Stein gradient for unbiased
distribution alignment, enhanced by linear-complexity Mamba layers for
efficient temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
demonstrate FindRec's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines,
particularly in handling long sequences and noisy multimodal inputs. Our
framework achieves both improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced model
interpretability through its modular design. The implementation code is

Motivation: PRP虽然排序性能优异，但其二次计算复杂度限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过成对蒸馏，将PRP生成的成对标签用于训练点排序学生模型，仅需少量样本即可达到同等性能。

Result: 学生模型在仅使用2%的成对标签时，性能与使用全部标签相当。

Conclusion: 该方法高效地实现了PRP的排序性能，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: While Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) with Large Language Models (LLMs) is
one of the most effective zero-shot document ranking methods, it has a
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of documents to
be ranked, as it requires an enumeration over all possible document pairs.
Consequently, the outstanding ranking performance of PRP has remained
unreachable for most real-world ranking applications.
  In this work, we propose to harness the effectiveness of PRP through pairwise
distillation. Specifically, we distill a pointwise student ranker from pairwise
teacher labels generated by PRP, resulting in an efficient student model that
retains the performance of PRP with substantially lower computational costs.
Furthermore, we find that the distillation process can be made
sample-efficient: with only 2% of pairs, we are able to obtain the same
performance as using all pairs for teacher labels. Thus, our novel approach
provides a solution to harness the ranking performance of PRP without incurring
high computational costs during both distillation and serving.

Abstract: Research on interactive and conversational information access systems,

there is a lack of infrastructure and tooling to support this kind of

to provide a centralized general solution for the community to benchmark both
conversational systems and user simulators in a controlled and reproducible
environment. We articulate requirements for such a platform and propose a
general infrastructure to address these requirements. We then present the
design and implementation of an initial version of SimLab and showcase its
features with an initial evaluation task of conversational movie

Conclusion: GTEs具有更强的表示能力，无需特定领域适应即可实现高性能，为推荐和搜索系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic
representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential
recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,
while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.
Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to
improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing
that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale
corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and
fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We
attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute
features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that
compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions
(e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of
specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at

### [253] [Lightweight LSTM Model for Energy Theft Detection via Input Data Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02872)
*Caylum Collier,Krishnendu Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级检测单元作为预过滤器，仅在可能涉及能源盗窃的情况下激活LSTM模型，显著降低了能耗，同时保持了检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电表普及后，能源盗窃检测成为重要挑战。现有AI模型虽性能强，但计算和能耗高，尤其在低盗窃场景下不实用。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级检测单元（看门狗机制），作为预过滤器，选择性激活LSTM模型以减少输入量。

Result: 在六种不同盗窃严重程度的场景中测试，能耗降低超过64%，检测准确性和召回率几乎无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为智能电网提供了更高效、可扩展的能源盗窃检测方案，强调了实际部署的可持续性和可扩展性。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至其他基于图像的诊断系统，为未来聚变反应堆提供合规控制器。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) has been promising for fusion control, its
inherent black-box nature will make compliant implementation in regulatory
environments a challenge. This study implements and validates a real-time AI
enabled linear and interpretable control system for successful divertor
detachment control with the DIII-D lower divertor camera. Using D2 gas, we
demonstrate feedback divertor detachment control with a mean absolute
difference of 2% from the target for both detachment and reattachment. This
automatic training and linear processing framework can be extended to any image
based diagnostic for regulatory compliant controller necessary for future
fusion reactors.

### [255] [Controllable diffusion-based generation for multi-channel biological data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02902)
*Haoran Zhang,Mingyuan Zhou,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的扩散框架，用于可控生成结构化空间生物数据，通过分层特征注入和通道注意力机制实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型难以处理高维空间生物数据的复杂通道关系，且缺乏灵活的条件生成能力。

Method: 采用分层特征注入和通道注意力机制，结合随机掩码训练策略，实现多分辨率条件生成和通道关系建模。

Result: 在空间和非空间预测任务中表现优异，如蛋白质填补和基因到蛋白质预测，并能泛化到未见过的条件配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为空间生物数据的生成建模提供了高效且灵活的方法。

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究结合近红外光谱（NIRS）和机器学习（ML）技术，区分韩牛（HNB）和荷斯坦牛（HLB）牛肉，以解决食品真实性和掺假问题。随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品标签错误和掺假问题，确保肉类真实性。

Method: 使用便携式NIRS获取光谱数据，结合PCA和多种ML模型（如随机森林、SVM等）进行分析和优化。

Result: 随机森林模型AUC最高（0.8826），SVM次之（0.8747），NN模型召回率最高（0.7804）。

Conclusion: NIRS与ML结合是检测肉类真实性的有效方法，有助于打击食品欺诈。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

### [257] [Scaling Transformers for Time Series Forecasting: Do Pretrained Large Models Outperform Small-Scale Alternatives?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02907)
*Sanjay Chakraborty,Ibrahim Delibasoglu,Fredrik Heintz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨预训练大规模时间序列模型（LSTSMs）在预测任务中是否优于传统非预训练小规模Transformer，分析了其准确性、计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练模型在多领域表现优异，但在时间序列预测中的应用尚未充分研究，需验证其效果。

Method: 比较预训练通用时间序列模型（如Moirai、TimeGPT）与传统Transformer，评估多基准下的性能。

Result: 预训练LSTSMs在某些场景有优势，但简单模型仍具竞争力，揭示了其适用性和局限性。

Conclusion: 预训练模型在特定任务中表现优异，但并非所有场景均优于传统方法，需根据需求选择。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
domains, but their effectiveness in time series forecasting remains
understudied. This work empirically examines whether pre-trained large-scale
time series models (LSTSMs) trained on diverse datasets can outperform
traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific
small-scale architectures. The results highlight scenarios where pretraining
offers advantages and where simpler models remain competitive.

### [258] [Hyperbolic Kernel Graph Neural Networks for Neurocognitive Decline Analysis from Multimodal Brain Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02908)
*Meimei Yang,Yongheng Sun,Qianqian Wang,Andrea Bozoki,Maureen Kohi,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双曲空间的图融合框架（HKGF），用于多模态神经影像分析，显著提升了神经认知衰退预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，无法有效捕捉脑网络的内在层次结构，限制了神经认知衰退分析的准确性。

Method: HKGF框架包括多模态图构建模块、双曲空间图表示学习模块（使用HKGNNs）、跨模态耦合模块和下游预测的双曲神经网络。

Result: 在超过4,000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在两项神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，可量化神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

### [259] [Beyond Token Pruning: Operation Pruning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02909)
*Aoming Liu,Reuben Tan,Boqing Gong,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GSOP的数据驱动方法，通过直接修剪操作而非令牌来减少冗余计算，同时保留关键操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM令牌修剪方法在减少计算时可能误删关键操作或保留冗余操作，GSOP旨在更精确地修剪冗余操作。

Method: GSOP将VLM解码器的计算分解为三个维度的原子操作，通过贪婪排序确定修剪顺序，并利用历史排名和排除特定操作提高效率。

Result: GSOP在减少70%计算的同时仅损失4%性能，且在跨VLM和任务中保持比现有方法高18%的性能。

Conclusion: GSOP通过精准修剪冗余操作，实现了高效的性能与计算权衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

*Geonwoo Cho,Jaegyun Im,Doyoon Kim,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CP-DRL是一种基于因果关系的课程强化学习框架，通过任务间因果模型差异和奖励增益优化任务序列设计，显著提升学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键，但现有方法依赖真实因果结构，不适用于大多数RL场景。

Method: 提出CP-DRL框架，利用交互数据近似任务间因果模型差异，结合奖励增益形成统一目标。

Result: 在Point Mass和Bipedal Walker等基准测试中，CP-DRL表现优于现有方法，收敛更快且方差更低。

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蒸馏方法依赖层和特征映射，限制了效率。DiceHuBERT旨在简化流程，直接利用HuBERT的自蒸馏机制。

Method: 直接替换HuBERT原始模型为学生模型，沿用SSL目标训练，无需额外模块或架构限制。

Result: 在SUPERB上，DiceHuBERT性能显著提升，音素识别和ASR分别提高21%和14%，多任务表现优异。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT通过简化蒸馏流程，实现了高效压缩和性能提升，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合DBSCAN聚类和Elastic Net回归的分析框架，用于解决结构复杂性和多重共线性的多因素问题，并以碳排放分析为例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决碳排放分析中因结构复杂性和多重共线性带来的挑战，提供一种更客观和高效的分析方法。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督学习的特征聚类，结合Elastic Net进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业的能源消耗数据（2000-2019），识别出16个类别，并定量评估了排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架具有全球适用性，能识别主要排放源并提供可操作见解，同时指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展且可信赖的二值神经网络（BNN）验证方法，支持定性和定量分析，显著提升了速度和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNN在安全关键应用中具有潜力，但现有分析方法存在可扩展性和可靠性问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用自定义求解器和近似模型计数器，结合专用证明生成和检查流程，支持BNN约束推理。

Result: 实验显示，定性验证速度提升9倍，定量验证速度提升218倍，覆盖率分别达到99%和86%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了BNN验证的效率和可靠性，为安全关键应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

### [264] [Echo State Transformer: When chaos brings memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917)
*Yannis Bendi-Ouis,Xavier Hinaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo State Transformers (EST) 结合 Transformer 注意力机制和 Reservoir Computing，解决了标准 Transformer 的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Transformer 模型在大脑认知任务处理和数据效率方面存在不足，且序列处理的二次复杂度限制了其扩展性。

Method: EST 结合 Transformer 注意力机制和 Reservoir Computing，引入并行随机循环网络（Working Memory）模块，动态调整内存/非线性权衡。

Result: 在 STREAM 基准测试的 12 个任务中，EST 在 8 个任务上优于 GRU、LSTM 和标准 Transformer。

Conclusion: EST 是 GRU 和 LSTM 的有效替代方案，并在资源受限和低数据场景下补充标准 Transformer。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems.
While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to
reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial
granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures
place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM
condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and
OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of
places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data
pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale
geospatial analysis.

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选、优先排序和结构评估。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: MolProphecy是一个结合化学家领域知识与分子预训练模型的多模态框架，通过ChatGPT模拟专家推理，提升分子属性预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子预训练模型虽能提高预测准确性，但缺乏专家驱动的解释性推理，MolProphecy旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用ChatGPT模拟化学家推理生成知识表示，通过门控交叉注意力机制与图分子特征融合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy为药物发现提供了一种实用且可推广的协作方法，支持真实化学家输入且无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统维护方法（反应性或基于时间的预防性）无法有效预防机器故障，导致停机和服务成本增加。

Method: 利用物联网传感器实时监控机器状态，并通过机器学习算法预测故障。

Result: 显著提高了早期故障检测能力，减少了不必要的维护干预。

Conclusion: 预测性维护系统可显著提升自动售货机的运营效率和服务可靠性。

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial
environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Result: 该方法能有效回答从简单图到蛋白质和超图的各种问题，且无需对架构进行重大调整。

Conclusion: 提出的无参数图编码器简化了现有方案，并在多种图结构中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上，MSE和MAE分别降低了81.3%和52.3%。

Conclusion: SDKD框架能有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Result: 多头注意力在特定条件下能协同增强信息传播，加快混合时间并提升极小极大保真度。

Conclusion: 多头注意力通过协同效应提升了性能，实验验证了理论预测。

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Motivation: 随着LLM在生物医学问答中的广泛应用，其答案的准确性和证据支持性引发担忧，因此需要一种评估框架。

Method: 采用比较管道分析数千个医生提交的问题，包括基于PubMed的检索增强系统和新型证据源（Alexandria）。

Result: PubMed系统支持44%的问题答案，新型证据源支持50%，两者结合可覆盖70%以上的问题。

Conclusion: 为提高LLM在科学内容中的价值，需开发能准确检索或实时生成证据的系统。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM生成长文本时，如何安全地整合私有信息是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有令牌的top-k子集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 计算成本降低8倍，生成的长文本质量与非私有生成相当。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能以低于非私有生成10倍的计算成本生成长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting

research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展罕见疾病患者的识别和分层，适用于临床护理和研究。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了内在几何如何影响学习能力，为结构化数据上的深度学习提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix

will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data

tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive

decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and
trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the
highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and
Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven

TL;DR: 论文证明了通用逼近定理（UAT）系统对齐的基本数学限制，指出灾难性失败是任何有用计算系统不可避免的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用逼近器的表达能力与其内在不稳定性之间的关系，揭示完美控制的数学不可能性。

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和经验必要性三个层面的论证，证明灾难性失败点的密度与网络表达能力成正比。

Result: 结果表明，完美对齐不是工程挑战，而是数学上的不可能，任务本身具有灾难性，迫使模型学习并复制这些不稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究将UAT安全性从“如何实现完美控制”重新定义为“如何在不可约的不可控性下安全操作”，对UAT开发和治理具有深远意义。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四层分类法（非可用性、隐私保护、可追溯性和可删除性），以解决现代生成式AI系统中数据保护的多样化需求，并分析了技术方法和监管盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据保护概念在AI时代已不足，需明确界定保护范围并严格执行，以避免社会和个体层面的风险。

Method: 提出四层分类法，涵盖训练数据集、模型权重、系统提示和AI生成内容，分析每层的技术方法。

Result: 揭示了数据效用与控制之间的权衡，并指出了监管盲点。

Conclusion: 为开发者、研究者和监管者提供了重新思考数据保护的框架，强调了与可信数据实践对齐的紧迫性。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

### [285] [Adaptive Cubic Regularized Second-Order Latent Factor Analysis Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03036)
*Jialiang Wang,Junzhou Wang,Xin Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应立方正则化二阶潜在因子分析（ACRSLF）模型，用于高效处理高维不完整数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据（HDI）在现实应用中普遍存在，但现有二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性面临优化不稳定问题。

Method: ACRSLF结合了自调谐立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，以动态缓解非凸优化不稳定性和精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在两个工业HDI数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF收敛更快且表示精度高于现有优化器驱动的LFA模型。

Conclusion: ACRSLF为HDI数据建模提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

TL;DR: Optimas是一个统一框架，通过为每个组件维护局部奖励函数（LRF）来优化复合AI系统，确保局部优化与全局性能一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合AI系统（如结合大型语言模型和传统机器学习模型）的优化因非可微结构和多样化配置而具有挑战性。

Method: Optimas为每个组件设计局部奖励函数（LRF），满足局部-全局对齐属性，并在迭代中调整LRF以最大化局部奖励。

Result: 在五个实际复合系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas提供了一种通用且有效的方法来优化复合系统。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Motivation: 探讨优化方法在实现人工认知方面的根本局限性，特别是灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 通过形式化证明和实验验证，分析优化方法的固有缺陷，并对比世界建模方法的优势。

Result: 优化方法无法避免灾难性遗忘和过拟合，而世界建模方法能有效解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 人工智能领域需超越机器学习，寻找更有效的方法以实现人工认知。

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时验证算法公平性的通用框架，适用于模型未知但具有马尔可夫链结构的系统，支持多种公平性属性的监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统在人类决策中广泛应用，确保其公平性（不基于敏感属性偏袒个体）至关重要。

Method: 引入一种规范语言建模常见公平性属性，构建监控器观察事件序列并实时输出公平性估计，误差随序列增长而减小。

Result: 监控算法分为均匀误差和非均匀误差两类，实验显示监控器更新判决时间小于1毫秒。

Conclusion: 框架有效监控系统公平性，适用于银行贷款和大学录取等场景。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏性在大型语言模型压缩中的优势，相比2:4稀疏性更灵活且存储开销小，同时通过结构化稀疏模式和简单技术提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型规模增大，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。然而，结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏化）因灵活性不足和对异常权重的敏感性而表现不佳。

Method: 研究采用8:16半结构化稀疏性，并应用结构化稀疏模式处理显著权重，同时结合方差校正和SmoothQuant类权重均衡化技术。

Result: 8:16稀疏性在性能阈值上超越未压缩或较小模型，且存储开销仅为0.875 bits/元素。结构化稀疏方法在异常权重处理上与无结构化方法竞争，甚至表现更优。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏性是一种高效且灵活的压缩方法，结合简单技术可显著提升稀疏模型的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Motivation: 在线学习兴起，数学评估需求增加，但手写图表自动评分研究较少，尤其在STEM课程中。

Method: 采用多模态元学习模型和VLLMs进行手写图表和文本的自动评分，并比较其性能。

Result: 元学习模型在2分类任务中表现更优，而VLLMs在3分类任务中略胜一筹。

Conclusion: VLLMs虽有潜力，但其可靠性和实用性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动数据通常因数据收集方法的限制而稀疏，影响公共健康、交通和城市规划等应用。

Method: BERT4Traj结合空间嵌入、时间嵌入和上下文背景特征（如人口统计和锚点），利用BERT的掩码语言建模目标和自注意力机制。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的CDR和GPS数据集上，BERT4Traj显著优于马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM等传统模型。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细且连续的移动轨迹，提升对人类移动模式的理解。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine (C²HM)，通过目标驱动的非对称推理扩展了传统Helmholtz Machine，提升了生成模型的效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Helmholtz Machine的对称数据驱动更新限制了其目标导向推理和时间扩展模拟能力，需要一种更灵活的框架。

Method: C²HM将推理重构为目标驱动的非对称过程，通过前向生成和逆向优化的循环一致性机制，结合变分循环实现目标与观测的对齐。

Result: C²HM提高了表示效率，支持路径依赖推理和空间组合想象，为生成模型提供了生物启发的替代方案。

Conclusion: C²HM通过将生成模型重新构想为有意图的模拟，统一了记忆规划和无监督学习。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中代理目标与设计目标不一致导致的泛化错误问题。

Method: 理论分析MEV和MMER目标下的目标泛化错误可能性，并在程序生成的网格世界环境中进行实证验证。

Result: MEV方法存在目标泛化错误，而MMER方法表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）是缓解目标泛化错误的有效方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

<details>

Motivation: 科学成像常面临从未见过的动态系统，测量数据稀疏且噪声大，需要一种模型无关的方法来重建复杂动态。

Method: NeuralDMD框架结合神经网络的表达能力与DMD的线性动态模态，实现低维稳定表示和预测。

Result: 在北美风速场和银河中心黑洞等离子体演化两个实际问题上，NeuralDMD优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文学等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法多专注于显式或隐式关系，缺乏同时支持两者的现代框架，且未充分利用重复结构模式加速搜索。

Method: SymMatika 结合多岛遗传编程和生物序列分析启发的模式库，识别高性能子结构并复用，同时支持显式和隐式关系发现。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升5.1%，首次恢复Nguyen-12，并在Feynman方程中表现竞争性，隐式物理定律发现速度提升100倍。

Conclusion: 结构感知的进化搜索对科学发现具有强大潜力，SymMatika 框架已开源以支持可解释建模和符号发现研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Conclusion: BLaST通过降低能耗、内存占用和延迟，推动下一代大规模AI系统发展。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在初始回答中表现出过度自信，但在受到挑战时又容易过度怀疑。通过实验，揭示了LLMs存在选择支持性偏见和对不一致建议的过度敏感，偏离了贝叶斯更新规范。

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在自信与怀疑之间的矛盾行为，揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 开发新的实验范式，利用LLMs获取置信度估计，避免记忆初始判断的影响。测试了Gemma 3、GPT4o和o1-preview等模型。

Result: LLMs表现出显著的选择支持性偏见和对不一致建议的过度敏感，偏离贝叶斯更新规范。这两种机制解释了其固执和过度敏感的行为。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的自信机制提供了机械性解释，揭示了其固执和过度敏感的原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习在领域泛化任务中仍面临鲁棒性不足的问题，现有方法多依赖单值预测，限制了其性能。

Result: 在WILDS基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 集合值预测器是提升领域泛化鲁棒性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

*Weishu Deng,Yujie Yang,Peiran Du,Lingfeng Xiang,Zhen Lin,Chen Zhong,Song Jiang,Hui Lu,Jia Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGCA是一种混合CPU-GPU注意力机制，通过结合GPU上的密集注意力和CPU上的稀疏注意力，解决了大语言模型推理中的GPU内存限制问题，同时保持高准确性和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理中，GPU内存限制（尤其是KV缓存）成为瓶颈，现有方法（如卸载到CPU或稀疏注意力）未能充分利用CPU资源或牺牲准确性。

Method: HGCA采用混合注意力机制：GPU上保留最近生成的KV条目进行密集注意力，CPU上并行处理选定的重要KV条目进行稀疏注意力，并通过log-sum-exp融合高效合并结果。

Result: 实验表明，HGCA在多种模型和任务中表现出色，支持更长序列和更大批量，性能与准确性均优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: HGCA在普通GPU硬件上实现了可扩展的高吞吐量推理，无需重新训练模型，为长上下文生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PiCME提出了一种多模态对比学习方法，用于整合临床数据，并通过Modality-Gated LSTM解决多模态性能下降问题，提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中潜力巨大，但现有方法主要局限于图像和文本对，缺乏对其他数据类型的系统评估。

Method: 提出PiCME框架，评估26种多模态组合，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM动态加权各模态重要性。

Result: 对比学习模型在三模态下表现优异，五模态时性能下降，但Modality-Gated LSTM显著提升了AUROC和AUPRC。

Conclusion: PiCME为多模态临床预测提供了有效的训练策略和公平性指导，是首个在MIMIC中全面评估多模态对比学习的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI视觉与人类视觉在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面的显著差异。

Method: 通过模拟人类视觉从婴儿到成人的发展过程，设计了一种新的视觉训练方法（DVD）。

Result: 该方法使AI在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优于现有高参数模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化学习方式而非增加数据量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Motivation: 准确描述复杂分子系统的平衡分布及其对温度等环境因素的依赖性，对于理解热力学性质和转变机制至关重要。

Method: LaTF将状态预测信息瓶颈(SPIB)与归一化流(NFs)结合，共同优化表示学习和生成建模，学习低维潜在变量(CVs)并生成平衡分布。

Result: LaTF在多种系统中表现出色，包括模型势能、Chignolin蛋白和Lennard Jones粒子簇，并能仅用两个温度的数据重建RNA tetraloop系统的温度依赖性结构集合。

Conclusion: LaTF通过联合优化表示学习和生成建模，有效捕捉系统的重要自由度并准确生成平衡行为，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

TL;DR: DistZO2是一个高效、内存优化的分布式零阶微调框架，通过并行策略和硬件感知通信优化，显著提升了大型语言模型的训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLM）规模庞大，传统微调方法资源消耗高，而零阶优化（ZO）虽节省内存但受限于单设备执行和低吞吐量。

Method: DistZO2引入三种并行策略：扰动并行（PertP）、分布式数据并行（DDP）和统一的2D并行设计，并结合硬件感知通信优化参数卸载。

Result: 在OPT-175B上的实验显示，DistZO2比ZO2提速3倍，同时保持内存效率。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调至多GPU系统，显著提升了训练效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in
https://github.com/liangyuwang/zo2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出通过神经抑制改进动态路由模型，提升深度学习的效率与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路由模型需要基于神经元群体的信号选择架构，神经抑制可以抑制共享信号，从而为每个数据样本选择专用路径。

Method: 采用神经抑制算法，抑制数据统计模式中的共享信号，使路由机制能有效选择神经通路。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升通用任务性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是实现混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型的有效方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP)的方法，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）在交互式问答任务中的顺序查询策略，通过使用一致性预测集来更准确地估计不确定性，从而减少查询次数并提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的顺序查询策略（如信息追踪IP）因LLM概率估计的不准确性导致查询选择和预测性能不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来估计不确定性。

Method: 提出C-IP方法，利用一致性预测集与条件熵之间的关系，通过预测集的平均大小来估计不确定性，替代传统的条件熵方法。

Result: 在20 Questions任务中，C-IP表现出更好的预测性能和更短的查询链；在MediQ数据集上，C-IP与单轮预测性能相当，同时提供更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布无关且鲁棒的不确定性估计方法，显著提升了交互式问答任务的效率和效果。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Motivation: 研究动机是填补Sentinel-5P对流层NO2产品（S5P-TN）中的缺失数据，特别是在云层遮挡等复杂情况下，验证低秩张量模型的可行性。

Method: 采用基于CP分解和交替最小二乘法（ALS）的低秩张量模型（LRTM），对S5P-TN数据进行填补，并与地统计学空间插值方法进行对比。

Result: 结果表明，低秩张量模型能有效重构S5P-TN中的缺失值，尤其在云层遮挡情况下表现优异，并能预测异常值和识别热点区域。

Conclusion: 研究证明了低秩张量模型在填补大规模时空动态大气变量缺失数据中的有效性，为类似问题提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的领域自适应方法因依赖小批量训练而无法全局建模分布，导致对齐不稳定和泛化能力不足。

Method: GVI-DA通过变分推断学习连续、类条件的全局先验，利用潜在特征重构和全局码本学习减少领域差异，并通过丢弃低置信度伪标签提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个基准和三十八个任务上取得最优性能，并分析了先验连续性、码本大小和伪标签噪声容忍度的影响。

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论和实践上均表现出色，优于扩散生成框架。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多粒度自适应参数分配方法（MGAA），用于优化大语言模型的低秩近似压缩，通过自适应分配压缩比例提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵采用统一压缩比例，忽视了其对模型性能的差异化影响，且启发式搜索策略效率低下。

Method: MGAA方法包括两部分：1）基于子层输入输出余弦相似度分配压缩比例；2）根据权重矩阵能量分布特性分配压缩比例。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和多模态模型LLaVA上的实验表明，MGAA显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: MGAA通过自适应参数分配，有效优化了压缩效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

Method: 提出Dyn-O模型，通过对象中心表示改进学习和动态建模，并将特征解耦为动态无关和动态感知组件。

Result: 在Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O直接从像素观察中学习对象中心世界模型，预测精度优于DreamerV3，并能生成更多样化的想象轨迹。

Conclusion: Dyn-O在复杂视觉环境中表现出色，验证了对象中心世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing
Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP
scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple
problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art
results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不规则采样时间序列中的因果发现问题，因传统方法无法处理多尺度交互和缺失数据，而神经网络方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出ReTimeCausal，结合加性噪声模型和期望最大化算法，通过核稀疏回归和结构约束迭代优化缺失值和因果图。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，ReTimeCausal在挑战性条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal有效解决了不规则采样和缺失数据问题，为高风险领域提供了可解释的因果发现框架。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JAX缺乏对混合精度训练的强有力支持，而混合精度训练已成为提升神经网络训练效率的重要工具。

Method: MPX通过将输入和输出转换为半精度，并引入动态损失缩放机制，解决半精度计算中的梯度问题。它还继承了JAX的类型提升行为，确保操作在正确的精度下进行。

Result: MPX能够无缝集成到现有JAX训练流程中，并提供自动创建和管理混合精度梯度与优化器的功能。

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source
code, documentation, and usage examples are available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合分子结构和稀疏正则化，显著提高了药物性质预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Method: 利用统计自由度自动确定特征维度，并提出分层训练策略学习非线性特征。

Result: 在多个预训练Transformer上验证，性能优于基线且不增加推理成本。

Conclusion: 方法有效且提供了注意力机制复杂度演变的见解。

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness

of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Conclusion: $z$-变换方法是一种强大且多功能的工具，适用于分析优化算法的渐近行为。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency

large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and

to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合形状信息的混合方法能生成更鲁棒的分子表示，为分子机器学习任务开辟新途径。

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.

Conclusion: MAFG框架为科学数据的特征生成提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单有效的方法，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，适用于大规模神经网络优化。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world

Method: 使用紧凑草图将梯度投影到低维空间，并引入随机探测防止草图退化。

Result: 通信开销从d维降至k维，梯度近似误差为σ²k，满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私。

Conclusion: DOME框架有效降低了联邦学习中差分隐私的成本，同时保证了隐私和效率。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经正切核（GNTK）的层堆叠策略导致冗余计算，限制了实际应用的可扩展性。

Method: SGTK用连续$K$步聚合操作替代多层堆叠；SGNK通过建模无限宽图神经网络为高斯过程，直接确定核值。

Conclusion: SGTK和SGNK通过简化计算流程，有效解决了GNTK的计算复杂性问题，同时保持了表达能力。

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Result: 在CSP和DNG任务中，KLDM表现出与当前最先进模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: KLDM为晶体材料生成提供了一种有效的扩散模型方法，解决了对称性和多模态性问题。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，需要可靠的点预测和可解释的不确定性量化，以准确估计个体治疗效果。

Method: 采用因子化蒙特卡洛丢弃框架，将总预测方差分解为共享编码器中的表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和结果头中的预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。

Result: 在合成数据中，区间校准良好（ECE < 0.03），且满足方差分解关系；在真实数据中，表示不确定性在分布外样本中显著增加，成为主要误差预测指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源提供了实用的诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Conclusion: PEM-UDE为构建多尺度脑模型提供了新途径，连接了微观神经元动态与宏观脑活动。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Method: 通过实验分析输出概率分布、损失和梯度向量几何、逐层激活动态以及激活空间维度，研究微调对模型内部机制的影响。

Result: 发现微调不安全代码会引发内部变化，这些变化与模型的对齐性相冲突，并识别出一个共享的潜在维度，该维度在模型激活空间中对齐行为起关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM对齐性的脆弱性，并强调需要开发更鲁棒的微调策略，以确保模型在不同领域中的行为一致性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Conclusion: AI与CFA框架结合提供了可扩展、可靠且减少偏见的初创企业评估方案，解决了传统方法的限制。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Conclusion: FAROS通过多标准约束，在预训练模型中直接优化生成过程，有效提升了公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

TL;DR: IMPACT框架通过重要性感知的激活重建优化LLM压缩，在保持精度的同时显著减小模型尺寸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在资源受限环境中部署困难，传统低秩权重压缩假设不适用于LLMs，而激活的低秩结构更适合压缩。

Method: 提出IMPACT框架，基于重要性加权的激活协方差矩阵特征向量进行优化，考虑激活结构和梯度敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，IMPACT在多种模型和任务中实现高达48.6%的模型尺寸减小，精度与现有基线相当。

Conclusion: IMPACT通过重要性感知的激活重建，为LLM压缩提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架MatRL，用于自动发现计算矩阵函数的迭代算法，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索优化算法序列和步长，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代方法参数调优复杂且耗时，尤其是在现代计算环境中，需要一种自动化方法来优化算法设计。

Method: 将算法设计视为序列决策问题，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索规划混合迭代序列和步长，针对特定输入矩阵分布和计算环境进行优化。

Result: MatRL生成的算法在实验中优于文献中的多种基线方法，且理论证明其能泛化到相同分布的大矩阵。

Conclusion: MatRL为矩阵函数计算提供了一种高效、自动化的算法设计方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

Result: 在Alps超级计算机上，支持128至512个GPU，并行效率达87%，适用于3,000至190,000原子结构。

Conclusion: 分布式eGNN为大规模电子结构预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

TL;DR: 通过减少ICD-10代码的粒度，在OLS模型中实现正则化，提高系数稳定性，同时保持模型可解释性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维回归中ICD-10代码作为预测变量时系数不稳定的问题，同时避免丢弃重要预测变量。

Method: 将ICD-10代码从七字符截断为六字符或更少，降低回归问题的维度。

Result: 减少代码粒度提高了系数稳定性，同时保留了所有诊断代码类别的表示。

Conclusion: 解释了为什么现实世界中更倾向于使用较宽泛的诊断分组（如DRGs和HCC代码）而非高度细化的ICD-10代码。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that
detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs

Result: OrbitAll在预测带电、开壳层和溶剂化分子方面表现优异，并能泛化至远大于训练数据的分子，且仅需十分之一的训练数据即可达到化学精度，速度比密度泛函理论快10^3-10^4倍。

Conclusion: OrbitAll为复杂分子系统提供了一种高效、通用的表示和预测框架。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FxLMS方法在主动噪声控制中需要优化高维滤波器权重，而噪声源的空间区域信息未被充分利用。通过利用低维流形约束滤波器权重，可以提升性能。

Method: 使用自编码器对稳态自适应滤波器的权重进行训练，并在潜在空间中更新权重，通过解码器生成消噪滤波器。研究了不同神经网络约束和归一化技术的影响。

Result: 在特定条件下，Latent FxLMS比标准FxLMS收敛更快，且稳态均方误差相当。

Conclusion: Latent FxLMS通过低维流形约束滤波器权重，显著提升了收敛速度，为主动噪声控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动态联合建模的挑战。

Method: 第一阶段使用Koopman增强的图卷积网络（K-GCN）将高维动态嵌入近似线性的潜在空间；第二阶段用Transformer建模潜在空间中的时间依赖。

Result: 在心脏时空动态预测中，TK-GCN表现优于现有基线，预测准确性高。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态，适用于长程预测。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: 高阶PINNs模型在解决参数化ODE问题时具有显著优势，尤其在控制应用中表现出实用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Conclusion: 集成方法在多种物理系统中表现出鲁棒性，是传统求解器的高效准确替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和LLMs的方法有望改善健康行为干预的RL应用。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional

learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该算法在多种领域的在线和离线环境中均优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为风险敏感强化学习提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，能够根据风险偏好定制策略。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Motivation: 多模态数据常因传感器频率不一致或设备故障而不完整和对齐不良，现有方法未能有效填充不平衡和不对齐的数据。

Method: 提出自排斥贪婪锚点搜索模块（SRGASM）和一致性感知填充模块（CAPM），分别用于识别锚点和填充对齐数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了多模态数据融合的质量，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

Result: 在QM9数据集上实验表明，GNN模型学习性能良好，可推断含20个非氢原子的化学图。

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN框架在性能和灵活性上优于传统方法，适用于小分子推断。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MCST-Mamba的多通道时空模型，用于同时预测交通数据中的多个变量，解决了现有方法只能预测单一变量或需要多个模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测在智能交通系统中至关重要，但由于动态路况、不同地点的交通模式变化以及外部因素（如天气和事故）的影响，预测具有挑战性。现有方法通常只能预测单一变量或需要多个模型，无法捕捉多变量间的联合模式。

Method: 提出MCST-Mamba模型，基于Mamba选择性状态空间架构，整合自适应时空嵌入，并将时间序列和空间传感器交互建模分为两个独立的Mamba块。

Result: MCST-Mamba在所有交通特征上同时评估，相比基线模型，具有更强的预测性能和更低的参数量。

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba模型能够有效捕捉多变量间的联合模式，为交通预测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，GCAT性能优于规则方法，并与现有神经嵌入模型竞争或更优。

Conclusion: 注意力架构在捕捉复杂关系模式上具有优势，GCAT为知识图谱补全任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Motivation: 实验室传感器异常检测需要快速适应新液体或传感器，传统方法可能无法满足实时性和轻量级需求。

Method: 使用定制PCB捕获传感器数据，通过基于注意力的单类自编码器进行训练，模型仅需30分钟正常数据即可使用。

Result: 模型在小数据集上表现良好（F1=0.72，精度=0.89，召回率=0.61），并能在边缘设备上高效运行（延迟<2秒）。

Conclusion: 该管道快速适应新场景，适用于实时边缘部署。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer位置嵌入方法无法有效捕捉源代码的层次结构（如AST），因此需要一种新的方法来编码这些结构信息。

Method: 提出了一种树状位置嵌入方法，显式编码AST中的层次关系（如节点深度和兄弟索引），并将其集成到CodeBERTa模型中。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa在MLM预训练和克隆检测任务中均优于基线模型，各项指标（如损失、准确率、F1分数等）均有提升。

Conclusion: 显式编码源代码的层次结构信息对提升Transformer模型的性能至关重要。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Conclusion: 研究为城市建模提供了网络效应整合方法，对政策制定和规划具有指导意义。

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in
stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the

fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential
for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature
directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops
and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge
layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent
temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal
temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the
thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical

Result: 实验证明两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，适用于识别错误标签、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM提供了高效准确的数据影响评估工具，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD成为首个在10M步内超越人类专家性能的方法，并成功解锁所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD是一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Motivation: 现有DFKD方法假设教师模型可信，但忽略了来自不可信教师的安全性和鲁棒性问题。本文首次探讨了NTL教师对DFKD的影响。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，通过对抗鲁棒性将合成样本分为ID-like和OOD-like两组，分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD对NTL教师的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD提供了一种对抗NTL教师误导的新思路，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Result: TM概率评分与数据基础概率相关，且在训练数据域外预测时表现更谨慎。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化技术为TM模型提供了新见解，并指出了图像分类任务的改进方向。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a

Result: Extra Trees算法表现最佳，准确率77%；气象条件（温度、风速、湿度）是主要污染驱动因素；2014-2022年污染改善31%。

Conclusion: 智能预测系统可为城市规划者提供有力工具，改善空气质量管理，技术已具备应用条件。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

Result: 明确了正向过程噪声对学习预测器的贡献，提供了新的理论见解。

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型的结构提供了更深入的理论理解。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

Method: 利用生成模型在自身生成数据上训练导致分布崩溃的现象，部分触发崩溃以实现遗忘。

Result: 理论证明PMC能收敛到遗忘目标，实验表明其更有效移除隐私信息，克服现有方法局限。

Conclusion: PMC为更全面的遗忘方法迈出重要一步，符合实际隐私约束。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Motivation: 环肽具有线性肽不具备的几何约束，提供了解决未满足医疗需求的新机会，但目标特异性环肽设计因数据不足而受限。

Method: CP-Composer将复杂环化模式分解为单元约束，通过几何条件引入扩散模型，训练时学习线性肽的约束组合，推理时生成新环肽。

Result: 实验显示，模型能生成多样化的目标结合环肽，成功率在38%至84%之间。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了高效工具，填补了数据不足的空白。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

Result: 数值实验表明，TNIHT在合成数据、图像和视频数据上表现优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TNIHT为高维低秩张量恢复提供了有效方法，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中成本过高或过低，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Conclusion: ACTOR提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，平衡安全性与实用性。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects

diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging

features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Result: 在模拟环境中成功减少车辆气动阻力，并确定最优历史长度和控制策略架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为有限传感器信息的实际应用提供了可行的控制策略优化方案。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，原型分离效果更好，且通信效率高。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm是一种高效且适用于资源受限环境的联邦学习框架。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: TinyProto通过类原型稀疏化和自适应缩放，显著降低联邦学习的通信开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中通信效率低的问题，特别是在资源受限环境下。

Method: 采用类原型稀疏化（CPS）和自适应原型缩放技术，减少通信数据量。

Result: 实验显示TinyProto通信成本降低4倍，且性能不变。

Conclusion: TinyProto高效、无需额外计算开销，适用于资源受限的异构联邦学习。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Method: 提出了一种通用方法CLAGA（Consistent Labeling Across Group Assignments），可消除不一致性，适用于任何现有CATE估计算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CLAGA显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: CLAGA有效解决了CATE估计中的不一致性问题，并显著提高了算法性能。

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RLHF的效果，代码已开源，支持人机对齐研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于交互分析的特征选择或模型开发提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）的自监督学习任务忽视了农业景观的独特时间特性（如自然周期）。

Method: 提出三种农业特定的自监督学习任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF）。

Result: 在SICKLE数据集上，FF在作物分类任务中达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；FF在印度全国尺度的任务中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 农业特定的自监督学习任务显著提升了遥感基础模型在农业领域的性能。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Motivation: 传统恶意软件检测方法因特征提取效率低下，难以实时部署，需平衡准确性与效率。

Method: 将恶意软件分类建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用D3QN框架进行动态特征选择。

Result: 在Big2015和BODMAS数据集上，D3QN分别达到99.22%和98.83%的准确率，特征维度减少96.6%和97.6%，计算效率提升30.1倍和42.5倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习的自适应特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中表现出色，显著提升了准确性和效率。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Conclusion: 提出的因果层次强化学习方法在理论和实验上均优于现有工作。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率电路（PCs）在推理任务中表现出色，但在表示学习方面尚未充分探索。现有方法依赖外部神经嵌入或基于激活的编码，存在局限性。

Method: APCs通过联合建模数据和嵌入，利用PC的易处理性进行概率推理，并结合神经解码器构建端到端可训练架构。

Result: 实验表明，APCs在重建质量、嵌入生成和处理缺失数据方面优于现有PC自编码方法，且与神经自编码器相比更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: APCs展示了PCs在表示学习中的潜力，为鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏提供了新方向。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 研究动机是通过IRL方法从观察到的智能体行为中推断其潜在效用函数或决策模型，以理解智能体的决策机制。

Method: 第一章利用显示偏好理论（Afriat定理）重构效用函数；第二章研究贝叶斯IRL，分析理性疏忽的贝叶斯效用最大化者；第三章提出基于Langevin动力学的自适应IRL算法。

Result: 研究结果表明，IRL方法能有效重构智能体的效用函数，并识别其决策行为（如认知雷达、贝叶斯最优序列检测器）。

Conclusion: 结论是IRL方法在多种场景下均能有效推断智能体行为背后的决策模型，且自适应算法能实时跟踪时变效用函数。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Conclusion: 论文为无假设策略学习提供了理论框架和算法支持，并通过实验验证了关键假设的实用性。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估协议对准确评估和增强语言模型安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Conclusion: 该理论为迁移学习提供了新的视角，特别是在特征学习机制下，任务对齐和特征重用的重要性。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法计算成本高、内存需求大且训练不稳定，尤其在大型模型上。

Method: 使用进化策略（ES）结合低秩适应降低优化维度，实现高效对齐。

Result: ESSA在数学推理任务上收敛更快、数据效率更高，优于梯度方法如GRPO。

Conclusion: ES为梯度对齐提供了一种高效可扩展的替代方案，适用于大型语言模型的后训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM-based RAG系统提供了可靠且经济的解释性方法，填补了现有技术与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

*Xujia Wang. Yunjia Qi,Bin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoSiA是一种动态优化关键参数的PEFT方法，通过梯度稀疏分析定位子网络并优化，减少计算开销，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在领域专业化任务中计算效率低且性能不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出LoSiA，动态定位并优化关键子网络参数，减少矩阵乘法；LoSiA-Pro进一步降低训练延迟。

Result: LoSiA性能接近全微调，训练时间最短，且减少持续训练中的遗忘。

Conclusion: LoSiA在计算效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于领域专业化和常识推理任务。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异常检测任务中，上下文变量影响目标变量的正常性，但本身并非异常指标。现有方法未能充分建模不确定性，限制了检测的可靠性和适应性。

Method: 提出正常性评分（NS）框架，基于异方差高斯过程回归，将Z分数视为随机变量，提供反映异常评估可靠性的置信区间。

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学实际应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有方法。置信区间支持不确定性驱动的决策。

Conclusion: NS框架通过建模不确定性和提供置信区间，显著提升了上下文异常检测的性能和实用性，尤其适用于医疗等领域。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Result: DOTResize在多个LLM家族和规模上优于现有剪枝技术，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize为模型压缩提供了一种高效且性能保留的新方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线通信网络对频谱利用效率的需求日益增长，AMC在动态频谱分配和干扰抑制中起关键作用，但边缘设备资源有限，需要轻量级模型。

Method: 采用双路径深度残差收缩网络（DP-DRSN）结合Garrote阈值进行信号去噪，设计了一个仅含27,000参数的紧凑型CNN-LSTM混合架构。

Conclusion: 该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高效且准确的AMC，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and

Result: 实验显示30毫秒级推理延迟，并在多种配置下实现准确的信道响应预测。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实时适应性和可解释性，适用于无线数字孪生平台和6G网络规划。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习中样本效率低的问题源于探索效率不足，现有方法未能充分利用专家演示和模拟器重置功能。

Method: 通过选择合适的辅助初始状态分布（可能与真实分布不同），并利用安全性概念（如回合长度）指导分布选择。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的困难探索环境中实现了最先进的样本效率。

Conclusion: 辅助初始状态分布和安全性概念的结合显著提升了在线强化学习的样本效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large

compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上的实验表明，IGDS显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC情况下。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论指导的采样方法，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能，尤其在低IPC设置下表现突出。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Motivation: 传统网格搜索调整自编码器隐藏层大小耗时且计算量大，亟需更高效的方法。

Method: 引入基于物理概念的自组织稀疏自编码器（SOSAE），通过惩罚特征向量的幅度和位置索引，动态优化特征空间维度。

Result: 实验表明，SOSAE在保持性能的同时，将浮点运算量（FLOPs）降低至其他基线的1/130。

Conclusion: SOSAE提供了一种高效且性能优越的自编码器特征空间优化方法。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is

excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting
training data with 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4%

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Conclusion: SEED有效解决幻觉问题，提升模型性能，为大型视觉语言模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

TL;DR: 论文提出Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR)方法，防止神经网络权重无界增长，恢复网络可塑性，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中权重无界增长导致的可塑性丧失问题，避免重新初始化网络带来的信息丢失。

Method: 提出SWR方法，通过逐步缩放权重防止无界增长，理论证明其能限制权重幅度并平衡层间权重。

Result: 实验表明SWR在热启动学习、持续学习和单任务学习中均能提升标准图像分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: SWR是一种有效防止权重无界增长的方法，能恢复网络可塑性并提升学习性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合了KAN的非线性表达能力和MLP的高效性，通过FiLM机制和RBF激活函数改进KAN的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)在计算成本和分类任务性能上的不足。

Method: 提出MJKAN，整合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构。

Result: 在函数回归任务中表现优异，图像和文本分类中与MLP竞争，但需调整基函数数量以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KAN的理论优势，同时提升了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Motivation: 解决标准RLHF方法中奖励函数不透明的问题，实现更透明、可审计的偏好学习。

Method: 引入概念瓶颈奖励模型（CB-RM），结合基于预期信息增益的主动学习策略动态标注概念。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，CB-RM在可解释性和样本效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CB-RM为透明、可审计且与人类对齐的奖励模型提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Conclusion: 通用LLM在生成高性能计算代码方面具有潜力，尤其在优化方面表现良好。

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Result: 在多种复杂度的实际城市任务中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现未来城市环境中的通用LLM智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree
of communication across the spatial dimensions of an input tensor. We study a
toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs的科学推理能力提供了挑战性和诊断性框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 利用原型对抗学习统一特征空间，并通过协作学习增强类信息；结合全局原型和局部特征生成混合特征。

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上，FedPall表现出优越的分类性能。

Conclusion: FedPall有效解决了联邦学习中的特征漂移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Result: 方法在小规模、类别不平衡或含虚假特征的数据上，加速了模型收敛，提升了准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过结合解释信号，该方法在小数据集上实现了更可靠和高效的模型训练。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Result: 在公开数据集上，NTSFormer在冷启动节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自教学和Transformer框架，有效解决了冷启动节点的孤立性和模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

Result: 在六种Atari环境中验证，攻击效果与现有训练时攻击相当，且能避开两种主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前研究重点，呼吁更强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在预算约束下有效降低了标注成本，适用于高成本标注和地理空间约束的实际场景。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

TL;DR: EAMil是一种多实例深度学习框架，利用TCR测序数据高精度诊断SLE和RA，性能优异，并具有临床潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TCR库在自身免疫疾病中具有重要免疫学特征，但临床应用受限于序列稀疏性和低见证率。

Method: 结合PrimeSeq特征提取、ESMonehot编码和增强门注意力机制。

Result: 模型在SLE和RA诊断中AUC分别达98.95%和97.76%，并能有效识别疾病相关基因。

Conclusion: EAMil为自身免疫疾病检测和分类提供了可解释的新方法，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小规模、领域特定数据集的替代训练策略，以提升上下文学习模型的泛化能力，同时解决大规模数据集的存储、质量和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式依赖大规模非结构化数据集，存在存储成本高、质量评估难、隐私和伦理问题。

Method: 利用多个小规模、领域特定数据集，结合元学习在Meta-Album集合上训练上下文学习模型。

Result: 模型在训练域外表现出更强的泛化能力，性能与单一大规模数据集训练的模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于精选数据集训练的Transformer模型在上下文预测中仍能泛化，并具有模块化和可替换性优势。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Motivation: 理解神经网络性能扩展与计算成本关系的机制，填补对扩展行为内部动态理解的空白。

Method: 通过神经切线核（NTK）分析数据和模型规模扩展下的神经网络行为，研究性能扩展与内部动态的关系，并量化核驱动与特征驱动扩展的过渡。

Result: 发现性能扩展指数相似时内部动态可能相反，表明仅性能扩展不足以理解神经网络机制；确定了支持特征学习的最大模型宽度，远小于典型大语言模型宽度。

Conclusion: 性能扩展指数不能完全反映神经网络内部机制，需结合内部动态分析；特征学习在有限宽度模型中的过渡行为对理解扩展机制至关重要。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Conclusion: 通过状态工具的多轮交互格式化，能更高效地利用推理时的额外计算，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

Motivation: 高维数据回归中，正则化超参数调优对避免过拟合和保证变量选择至关重要，但现有方法在维度增加时性能下降。

Method: 通过假设数据分布满足特定条件（如子高斯分布），推导出泛化误差的分布依赖边界，并扩展到岭回归的变体。

Result: 在数据分布“良好”时，泛化误差边界不随维度增加而恶化，且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在高维数据下表现更优，为多任务回归中的正则化调优提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Result: 在nuPlan数据集上验证了模型能有效捕捉场景语义并形成有意义的分组，无需人工标签即可实现场景检索。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶测试提供了可扩展的场景选择基础，增强了测试效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注孤立成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义PPI网络的能力，而这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个高质量、多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种互补的评估范式：拓扑导向和功能导向任务。

Result: 实验表明，现有PPI模型在恢复网络结构和功能特性方面存在局限性，凸显了实际生物应用中的差距。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

TL;DR: DICE方法是一种生成建模方法，通过学习有限时间点样本群体的演化来捕捉平滑的群体动态，而非复杂个体轨迹。其损失函数具有不变性，训练稳定且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉群体动态的平滑性，且训练不稳定。DICE旨在解决这些问题，提供高效且稳定的建模方法。

Method: DICE通过设计不变性损失函数，直接学习群体动态的演化，避免复杂个体轨迹的影响。生成样本时直接在时间区间内演化，无需多步采样。

Result: DICE在训练稳定性和生成效率上优于其他方法，实验验证了其在随机波、Vlasov-Poisson不稳定性和高维混沌等问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: DICE是一种高效、稳定的生成建模方法，适用于捕捉群体动态，尤其在复杂系统中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Method: 提供基于最新理解的测试用例和实现方法，结合数学与代码进行讲解。

Result: 为初学者提供了更深入的理解和可靠的实现方法。

Conclusion: 本文旨在通过教程形式，帮助初学者更好地理解和应用KFAC。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合硬件/软件的框架，用于在资源受限的TinyML硬件上高效运行神经符号AI（NSAI），通过训练、压缩和部署确定性概率电路（PCs），显著减少了硬件资源需求并提高了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在嵌入式场景中的局限性（如不确定性和规则推理），同时克服符号模型在TinyML硬件上的计算挑战。

Method: 1. 训练硬件高效的确定性PCs；2. 使用n次根压缩技术压缩PCs；3. 在TinyML硬件上部署完整的NSAI模型。

Result: 相比64位精度基线，硬件资源显著减少（FPGA上FF减少82.3%，LUTs减少52.6%，Flash减少18.0%），ESP32微控制器上的推理速度平均提升4.67倍。

Conclusion: 通过硬件/软件协同设计，实现了在资源受限的TinyML硬件上高效运行NSAI，为嵌入式AI提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Conclusion: 世界模型的主要目标应是为有目的推理和行动模拟真实世界的所有可行可能性，新架构为实现这一目标提供了可能。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试的排名结果相互矛盾，导致模型选择和比较困难，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 该方法显著提高了排名一致性，增强了排名的外部有效性，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将“train-before-test”作为语言模型基准测试的默认组成部分。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的摘要对语言模型仍具挑战性，传统方法资源消耗大或效果不佳。

Method: 提出三种logits重加权技术：常量偏移、因子缩放和阈值选择，并在Gemma-2B和Llama-3-8B模型上评估。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术能有效增加主题相关词汇的使用，尤其是阈值选择法在不影响摘要质量的情况下提升了主题聚焦。

Conclusion: 直接重加权logits是一种实用且资源高效的替代微调方法，为精确控制生成文本的主题内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADS多关注预测问题，但实际部署中它们通过政策干预影响人群结果，需更全面的视角。

Method: 提出新问题框架，将预测视为决策支持和最终决策的一部分，结合现代统计工具研究ADS的设计与评估。

Result: 揭示了孤立预测任务的局限性，为干预导向的ADS开发和部署奠定基础。

Conclusion: 需转向干预范式，以更有效地设计和评估ADS在社会系统中的实际影响。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

Motivation: 当前混合推断工具仅针对均值或单一分位数，限制了其在关键领域的应用。

Result: 在经济学建模、民意调查和语言模型自动评估中验证了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: QuEst为基于分位数的分布度量提供了灵活且严谨的解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cascade的新型多方推理协议，通过序列维度分片提高隐私保护性能，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证以换取更高的性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM参数规模增大，计算资源需求增加，第三方推理服务普及，但引发用户数据隐私问题。现有安全方案如SMPC因计算和通信开销大，难以扩展到大模型。

Method: 提出Cascade协议，利用序列维度分片技术，在保持隐私的同时减少开销，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证。

Result: Cascade能抵抗近期攻击的泛化形式，并对基于学习的攻击具有抵抗力，性能比现有方案快几个数量级。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代LLM的安全部署提供了实用解决方案，平衡了隐私与性能。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GWAS常忽略非线性遗传相互作用，而现有深度学习方法存在特征选择或数据泄漏问题，且协变量可能干扰预测性能。

Method: 研究了不同深度学习架构，提出严格无泄漏条件下的优化方法，并扩展为多标签框架，联合建模五种疾病。

Result: 在37,000样本和五百万SNPs上，方法表现出色（AUC 0.68-0.96），具有可扩展性和生物学意义。

Conclusion: 该方法为多疾病GWAS分析提供了高效、无泄漏且生物学意义明确的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统填补方法在高缺失率（约50%或更高）时表现不佳，KZImputer旨在优化填补精度，提升时间序列数据质量。

Method: KZImputer采用混合策略，结合线性插值和局部统计量，根据缺失位置（起始、中间或末尾）和周围数据特性调整填补技术。

Result: 在系统评估中，KZImputer在高缺失率和高稀疏性场景下表现优异，优于传统方法，尤其在信号重建和统计指标上稳定。

Conclusion: KZImputer显著提升了时间序列数据的完整性，特别适用于高缺失率场景，为后续分析提供了更可靠的数据基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces KZImputer, a novel adaptive imputation method for
univariate time series designed for short to medium-sized missed points (gaps)
(1-5 points and beyond) with tailored strategies for segments at the start,
middle, or end of the series. KZImputer employs a hybrid strategy to handle
various missing data scenarios. Its core mechanism differentiates between gaps
at the beginning, middle, or end of the series, applying tailored techniques at
each position to optimize imputation accuracy. The method leverages linear
interpolation and localized statistical measures, adapting to the
characteristics of the surrounding data and the gap size. The performance of
KZImputer has been systematically evaluated against established imputation
techniques, demonstrating its potential to enhance data quality for subsequent
time series analysis. This paper describes the KZImputer methodology in detail
and discusses its effectiveness in improving the integrity of time series data.
Empirical analysis demonstrates that KZImputer achieves particularly strong
performance for datasets with high missingness rates (around 50% or more),
maintaining stable and competitive results across statistical and
signal-reconstruction metrics. The method proves especially effective in
high-sparsity regimes, where traditional approaches typically experience
accuracy degradation.

Motivation: 结合差分隐私与秩检验方法，解决传统方法在隐私保护方面的不足。

Method: 开发了RPST检验，通过秩变换和参数调整实现隐私保护与统计效力的平衡。

Result: RPST检验在保证差分隐私的同时，控制了I类错误，并通过模拟验证了其性能。

Conclusion: RPST检验在隐私保护与统计效力间取得平衡，并可扩展至其他检验方法。

Abstract: We develop a class of differentially private two-sample scale tests, called
the rank-transformed percentile-modified Siegel--Tukey tests, or RPST tests.
These RPST tests are inspired both by recent differentially private extensions
of some common rank tests and some older modifications to non-private rank
tests. We present the asymptotic distribution of the RPST test statistic under
the null hypothesis, under a very general condition on the rank transformation.
We also prove RPST tests are differentially private, and that their type I
error does not exceed the given level. We uncover that the growth rate of the
rank transformation presents a tradeoff between power and sensitivity. We do
extensive simulations to investigate the effects of the tuning parameters and
compare to a general private testing framework. Lastly, we show that our
techniques can also be used to improve the differentially private signed-rank
test.

Conclusion: Kullback-Leibler散度在梯度流方法中具有独特优势，适用于无需归一化常数的采样问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It
is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the
space of probability distribution in which we aim to minimise a divergence from
$\pi$. and The optimisation problem is normally solved through gradient flows
in the space of probability distribution with an appropriate metric. We show
that the Kullback--Leibler divergence is the only divergence in the family of
Bregman divergences whose gradient flow w.r.t. many popular metrics does not
require knowledge of the normalising constant of $\pi$.

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护环境下能有效替代传统定向方法，且效果显著优于直观基准策略。

Abstract: Major advertising platforms recently increased privacy protections by
limiting advertisers' access to individual-level data. Instead of providing
access to granular raw data, the platforms only allow a limited number of
aggregate queries to a dataset, which is further protected by adding
differentially private noise. This paper studies whether and how advertisers
can design effective targeting policies within these restrictive privacy
preserving data environments. To achieve this, I develop a probabilistic
machine learning method based on Bayesian optimization, which facilitates
dynamic data exploration. Since Bayesian optimization was designed to sample
points from a function to find its maximum, it is not applicable to aggregate
queries and to targeting. Therefore, I introduce two innovations: (i) integral
updating of posteriors which allows to select the best regions of the data to
query rather than individual points and (ii) a targeting-aware acquisition
function that dynamically selects the most informative regions for the
targeting task. I identify the conditions of the dataset and privacy
environment that necessitate the use of such a "smart" querying strategy. I
apply the strategic querying method to the Criteo AI Labs dataset for uplift
modeling (Diemert et al., 2018) that contains visit and conversion data from
14M users. I show that an intuitive benchmark strategy only achieves 33% of the
non-privacy-preserving targeting potential in some cases, while my strategic
querying method achieves 97-101% of that potential, and is statistically
indistinguishable from Causal Forest (Athey et al., 2019): a state-of-the-art
non-privacy-preserving machine learning targeting method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文学习（ICL）的方法，用于估计生成代码的功能正确性，尤其是在缺乏测试用例的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速应用开发中，需要评估LLM生成代码的功能正确性，但缺乏测试用例。类似于信息检索中的查询性能预测（QPP），需要评估生成代码的质量。

Method: 采用上下文学习（ICL）方法，通过提供少量功能正确的代码示例，提升现有QPP方法和零样本方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，提供少量功能正确的代码示例能显著提升代码质量估计的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文学习方法能有效提升生成代码的质量评估，尤其在缺乏测试用例的场景下。

Abstract: When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that
follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes
necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the
absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked
list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to
choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of
alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies
that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance"
for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative
software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional
correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based
approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing
few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the
performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach
for code quality estimation.

Motivation: 解决人工设计提示的低效问题，探索程序化优化提示的潜力。

Method: 使用DSPy框架在五个用例中优化提示，评估性能变化。

Result: 部分用例性能显著提升（如提示评估任务准确率从46.2%升至64.0%），但效果因任务不同。

Conclusion: DSPy的系统化提示优化能提升LLM性能，但需结合具体任务评估。

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This
study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization
framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five
use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code
generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how
prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases
demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use
case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed
notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a
substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the
router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and
of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was
explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,
using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.
Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt
optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning
and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by
task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt
optimization research.

Motivation: 间歇性任务失败（如不稳定测试或基础设施问题）是CI中的主要挑战，现有方法依赖大量手动标签或启发式方法，但效果有限且易误标。

Method: 通过少样本学习（FSL）微调小型语言模型，生成丰富的嵌入表示，用于训练机器学习分类器。

Result: 在仅使用12个样本的情况下，FSL方法在多个项目中达到70-88%的F1分数，显著优于现有方法（34-52%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明数据质量比数量更重要，并提供了一种更高效、实用的间歇性任务失败检测框架。

Abstract: One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous
integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job
failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky
tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such
as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large
datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or
regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on
non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job
failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not
an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In
fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1
open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job
failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using
few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model
using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich
embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based
approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,
outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4
projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over
quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the
detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.

Conclusion: 结论指出未来需更多综合评估和团队研究，以填补现有研究空白。

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to
transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these
tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and
design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how
LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we
present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published
between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis
reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical
risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated
development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,
studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team
collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of
studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two
SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer
productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial
room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency
are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and
Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and
methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.

use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like
BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular
for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop
word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising
after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software
projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug
localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on
specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation
metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold
cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust
statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to
provide useful insights for practitioners.

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a

positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the
growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence.
Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust,
data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through
comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the
logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of
determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time
series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the
Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high
computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning
algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for
practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening
new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time
series data are available.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ZettaLith是一种新型计算架构，旨在将AI推理的成本和功耗降低1000倍以上，相比当前GPU系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的高计算成本和功耗限制了其广泛部署和扩展，现有硬件面临效率瓶颈。

Method: ZettaLith通过放弃通用GPU应用，采用多重新设计的架构创新，基于成熟的数字电子技术实现高效能。

Result: 预计到2027年，单个ZettaLith机架可实现1.507 zettaFLOPS，性能提升1047倍，能效提升1490倍，成本效益提升2325倍。

Conclusion: ZettaLith为AI推理提供了一种高效、低成本且可扩展的解决方案，适用于从桌面到移动设备的多种规模。

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated
AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further
scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This
paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to
reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current
GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections,
a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 -
representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x
better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current
leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture
achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via
the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations
using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper.
ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS
desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x
advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the
complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively
for AI inference and is not applicable for AI training.

TL;DR: Symbiosis提出了一种高效的PEFT框架，解决了现有框架在多适配器推理和微调中的资源浪费和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT框架在多适配器推理和微调中存在资源浪费、灵活性不足和隐私问题。

Method: Symbiosis通过共享基础模型层和分离执行技术，实现资源高效利用和用户隐私保护。

Result: 在Llama2-13B上，Symbiosis在相同GPU和时间下可微调4倍多的适配器。

Conclusion: Symbiosis显著提升了PEFT的资源利用率和灵活性，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the
task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the
original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to
creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or
fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,
each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in
excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular
inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow
independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They
cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and
fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to
expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we
address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.
The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning
processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of
client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering
them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,
to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and
works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our
evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can
fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Method: 结合基于分数的扩散模型和Transformer架构，进行参数估计和贝叶斯模型比较。

Result: COMPASS验证了NuGrid的AGB产率和IllustrisTNG的SN产率，推断出陡峭的高质量IMF斜率和较高的SN Ia标准化。

Conclusion: 现代SBI方法能有效约束天体物理模拟中的不确定性，支持复杂数据的模型选择。

Abstract: We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework
that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to
jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across
competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles
high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. %
Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS}
evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly
favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields
used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior
probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope
and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar
neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference.
% Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain
uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model
selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

Motivation: 解决基于能量的概率模型因配分函数难以处理而受限的问题，探索伪似然最大化方法的潜力。

Method: 通过最大化伪似然替代全局归一化，研究其在零温度极限下的行为，并在多种数据集上验证其性能。

Result: 伪似然最大化在零温度极限下实现关联记忆，且在小训练集上表现出优于经典Hopfield规则的吸引域。随着训练数据增加，网络展现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: 伪似然不仅是一种高效推理工具，还能作为记忆和泛化的机制。

Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the
data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used
workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global
normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the
zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood
naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small,
patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those
of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on
uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured
datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics
(spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples
increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful
attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the
ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works
both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory
and generalization.

Method: 比较语音转录与字典参考转录以量化重音强度，利用自监督学习技术估计发音特征，分析英美英语发音者的语料库。

Result: 舌位模式能区分两种方言，尤其在rhotic和低后元音上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果为自动化重音分析和发音建模提供了贡献。

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory
features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare
phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based
references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength.
The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory
inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of
read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines
correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength
proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent
strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two
dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back
vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory
modeling for speech processing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非侵入式评估模型仅预测语音的单一平均意见分数（MOS），无法泛化到其他音频领域，且合并了多种感知因素。

Method: MMMOS融合了三个预训练编码器（WavLM、MuQ和M2D）的帧级嵌入，并评估了三种聚合策略和四种损失函数。通过集成前八名模型，显著提升了性能。

Result: MMMOS在均方误差上减少了20-30%，Kendall's τ提高了4-5%，在八项生产复杂性指标中六项排名第一，32项挑战指标中17项排名前三。

Conclusion: MMMOS在多领域音频质量评估中表现出色，显著优于基线模型。

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating
audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive
assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging
diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose
MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that
estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity,
Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and
environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained
encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with
four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30%
reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus
baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and
ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Result: 音频和视听系统在开发集上显著超越基线，模型集成和视觉后处理进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 未来将研究各模态的贡献和架构变体以进一步提升结果。

Abstract: This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual
tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and
Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines
temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning
across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the
most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel
input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to
data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate
autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We
pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and
apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the
training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially
outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model
ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future
work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore
architectural variants to further enhance results.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态剪枝方法，应用于DEMUCS语音增强架构，使其能够根据输入自适应调整计算资源，实现性能与效率的动态平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的设备上部署语音增强系统时，通常需要在性能和计算效率之间静态权衡。本文旨在通过动态剪枝技术解决这一问题。

Method: 通过动态剪枝技术，使模型能够在不同利用率因子（UF）下运行，每个UF对应不同的性能/效率权衡。同时，通过路由器子网为当前输入选择最优UF。

Result: 动态剪枝模型在平均使用10%容量的情况下，语音质量与静态25%利用率相当或更好，同时减少了29%的乘法累加运算（MACs）。

Conclusion: 动态路由的引入使模型能够高效地自适应调整资源使用，实现了性能和计算效率的帕累托最优。

Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) enables robust speech recognition, real-time
communication, hearing aids, and other applications where speech quality is
crucial. However, deploying such systems on resource-constrained devices
involves choosing a static trade-off between performance and computational
efficiency. In this paper, we introduce dynamic slimming to DEMUCS, a popular
SE architecture, making it scalable and input-adaptive. Slimming lets the model
operate at different utilization factors (UF), each corresponding to a
different performance/efficiency trade-off, effectively mimicking multiple
model sizes without the extra storage costs. In addition, a router subnet,
trained end-to-end with the backbone, determines the optimal UF for the current
input. Thus, the system saves resources by adaptively selecting smaller UFs
when additional complexity is unnecessary. We show that our solution is
Pareto-optimal against individual UFs, confirming the benefits of dynamic
routing. When training the proposed dynamically-slimmable model to use 10% of
its capacity on average, we obtain the same or better speech quality as the
equivalent static 25% utilization while reducing MACs by 29%.

Conclusion: 该研究为PEM电解槽膜降解提供了一种新颖的混合建模方法，为电化学系统诊断的预测工具奠定基础。

Abstract: Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are pivotal for sustainable
hydrogen production, yet their long-term performance is hindered by membrane
degradation, which poses reliability and safety challenges. Therefore, accurate
modeling of this degradation is essential for optimizing durability and
performance. To address these concerns, traditional physics-based models have
been developed, offering interpretability but requiring numerous parameters
that are often difficult to measure and calibrate. Conversely, data-driven
approaches, such as machine learning, offer flexibility but may lack physical
consistency and generalizability. To address these limitations, this study
presents the first application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to
model membrane degradation in PEM electrolyzers. The proposed PINN framework
couples two ordinary differential equations, one modeling membrane thinning via
a first-order degradation law and another governing the time evolution of the
cell voltage under membrane degradation. Results demonstrate that the PINN
accurately captures the long-term system's degradation dynamics while
preserving physical interpretability with limited noisy data. Consequently,
this work introduces a novel hybrid modeling approach for estimating and
understanding membrane degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers, offering a
foundation for more robust predictive tools in electrochemical system
diagnostics.

Motivation: 现有解释性AI方法无法处理TCR-pMHC建模中的编码器-解码器transformer，限制了对其机制的深入理解。

Method: 提出QCAI方法，专注于解码器的交叉注意力机制解释，并使用TCR-XAI基准（包含274个实验确定的TCR-pMHC结构）进行定量评估。

Result: QCAI在解释性和预测准确性上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: QCAI填补了现有方法的空白，为T细胞响应的机制研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the
adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major
Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs).
Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to
understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in
developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have
achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature
precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding
of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are
confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and
cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To
address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a
new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in
transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods;
we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally
determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using
these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid
residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method
and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the
dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.

Result: CPNN在水力学预测中R2>0.8的占比95.2%，PM预测中R2>0.8的占比72.6%。

Conclusion: CPNN框架为雨水基础设施的长期性能评估提供了潜力，支持气候适应性规划。

Abstract: Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems
that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic
rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment
performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional
lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are
computationally efficient but oversimplify transport and reaction processes,
limiting predictive accuracy and insight. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
resolves detailed turbulent transport and pollutant fate physics but incurs
prohibitive computational cost for unsteady and long-term simulations. To
address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based
neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator
learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and
particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated
on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results
indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 > 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of
test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 > 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and
0.4 < R2 < 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing
dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution
to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of
the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on
PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous,
long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed,
marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation.

Motivation: 探讨为何美国股市收益主要来自隔夜交易，而非日内交易。

Method: 使用240万篇新闻文章，采用监督主题分析技术，选择能解释市场收益的新闻主题。

Result: 新闻主题的流行度和市场对新闻的反应差异共同解释了隔夜与日内收益的差异。方法还能预测哪些股票隔夜表现好、日内表现差。

Conclusion: 新闻是解释隔夜收益的重要机制，与其他文献提出的机制形成对比。

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have
been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or
flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through
features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4
million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis
that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous
market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics
and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the
difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our
approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and
particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of
continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the
effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain
overnight returns.

Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary
on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano
performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical
expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation
that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based
architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the
traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in
continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous
values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal
usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions
with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the
influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic
dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with
different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new
environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two
baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical
analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and
introduces an overestimation bias.

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a
recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations
of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data.
Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent
representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw
audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch
masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a
straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still
show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than
one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code
and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）影响全球超过1000万人，语音障碍常早于运动症状出现，因此语音成为早期非侵入性检测的重要方式。现有深度学习模型虽准确率高，但缺乏临床所需的可解释性。

Method: 提出RECA-PD，结合可解释语音特征与自监督表示，通过跨注意力架构实现高性能和可解释性。此外，通过分段长录音缓解某些语音任务（如独白）的性能下降。

Result: RECA-PD在语音PD检测中达到最先进性能，同时提供更一致且临床意义更强的解释。

Conclusion: 性能和可解释性并非互斥。未来工作将提升解释对非专家的可用性，并探索严重性估计以增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

### [484] [Toward Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition via Spectral Learning and Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03251)
*HyeYoung Lee,Muhammad Nadeem*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于1D-CNN和注意力机制的语音情感识别方法，通过MFCC特征和数据增强技术显著提升了模型性能，并在多个数据集上取得了领先的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音情感识别方法难以捕捉细微情感变化且泛化能力不足，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 使用MFCC作为频谱特征，结合数据增强技术和1D-CNN架构，引入通道与空间注意力机制以突出关键情感模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得高准确率（如SAVEE 97.49%、RAVDESS 99.23%等），证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度学习技术显著提升了语音情感识别的泛化能力和精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data
analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different
methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle
emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article,
we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to
bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory
perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a
novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques.
MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and
spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to
highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle
variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge
performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS,
89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO.
Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high
precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep
Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse
datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment
in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

Motivation: 解决音乐生成AI中的伦理挑战，如透明度和责任问题，并推动开放模型的透明和负责任发展。

Method: 通过MIR社区的110名参与者调查，调整LLM开放性框架为音乐领域，形成MusGO框架。

Result: 评估了16个模型，提供了开放性排行榜，促进公众监督和社区贡献。

Conclusion: 旨在明确音乐生成AI的开放性概念，推动其透明和负责任发展。

Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite
significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical
ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along
with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the
importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI
Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled
as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In
this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for
assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of
110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we
refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13
openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is
fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work,
we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote
its transparent and responsible development.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Dutch archival television broadcast data for
self-supervised learning of speech foundation models, specifically wav2vec 2.0.
We first study data quality assumptions for pre-training, and show how music,
noise and speaker overlap affect SSL convergence and downstream fine-tuning
performance. Secondly, we explore effectively pre-processing strategies to
convert the noisy broadcast dataset into a qualitative dataset for
pre-training, by using Whisper and WhisperX., Thirdly, we compare mono-lingual

mono-lingual pre-training is more robust to out-of-domain data. Lastly, we
achieve a state-of-the-art LARGE wav2vec 2.0 model for the Dutch language, by a
continuation of pre-training a wav2vec 2.0 XLS-R model checkpoint with our 55k

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决符号音乐理解任务中预训练模型性能不足的问题，通过设计新的预训练目标提升模型对音乐知识的掌握。

Method: 设计了两种预训练目标：1）标记校正（对噪声标记进行去噪）；2）钢琴卷预测（从噪声标记预测钢琴卷表示）。

Result: 在包含12个下游任务的基准测试中表现优异，验证了预训练目标的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的预训练目标能有效提升模型在符号音乐理解任务中的性能。

Abstract: We propose a pre-trained BERT-like model for symbolic music understanding
that achieves competitive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks.
To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely
token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note
tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the
model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to
predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the
corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better
learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we
propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord
estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲-巴西Maracatu传统音乐的复杂节奏模式对传统模型提出了挑战，需要更高效的检测方法。

Method: 采用两种预训练的时态卷积网络架构（起始点检测和节拍跟踪），通过分层再训练策略对五种传统打击乐器进行微调。

Result: 在最佳情况下，F1分数达到0.998，性能提升超过50个百分点，跨任务适应尤其适用于时间保持乐器。

Conclusion: 该方法为代表性不足的音乐传统提供了高效解决方案，推动了更包容的音乐信息检索工具的发展。

Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the
Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns
that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network
architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for
beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per
instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies
for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up
to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage
points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly
effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat
positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument,
highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This
approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions,
offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation
effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive
music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音转换中的基频、时长和语速等特征的精确控制仍具挑战性，传统方法依赖声码器，而本研究旨在提供更直观的控制手段。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络，显式条件化基频、音素序列、强度和说话人身份，生成梅尔频谱图，再通过通用神经声码器转换为波形。

Result: 在说话人转换和情感语音任务中，该方法表现出高灵活性和良好的可懂度及说话人相似性。

Conclusion: 该方法为语音转换提供了直观且灵活的控制方式，同时保持了高质量的语音输出。

Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and
speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion.
The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an
important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used
independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically
addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that
aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme
sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on
disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these
factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms
using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours,
phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for
intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks
using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the
proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high
intelligibility and speaker similarity.

Result: Boomerang采样能保留节奏结构，在有限训练数据下提升节拍跟踪器性能，并实现单音输入的文本乐器替换。

Conclusion: Boomerang采样在音频数据增强和内容编辑中具有潜力，未来可探索更多应用场景。

Abstract: Generative models of music audio are typically used to generate output based
solely on a text prompt or melody. Boomerang sampling, recently proposed for
the image domain, allows generating output close to an existing example, using
any pretrained diffusion model. In this work, we explore its application in the
audio domain as a tool for data augmentation or content manipulation.
Specifically, implementing Boomerang sampling for Stable Audio Open, we augment
training data for a state-of-the-art beat tracker, and attempt to replace
musical instruments in recordings. Our results show that the rhythmic structure
of existing examples is mostly preserved, that it improves performance of the
beat tracker, but only in scenarios of limited training data, and that it can
accomplish text-based instrument replacement on monophonic inputs. We publish
our implementation to invite experiments on data augmentation in other tasks
and explore further applications.

Conclusion: Expotion通过多模态控制和文本提示显著提升了音乐生成质量，并提供了一个新的数据集，为未来多模态和交互式音乐生成研究提供了潜力。

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal
Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls -
specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a
novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing
expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and
interactive music generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前歌唱语音合成（SVS）在捕捉声乐风格、特定流派的音高变化和语言依赖特征方面仍面临挑战，尤其是在低资源场景下。

Method: 提出LAPS-Diff模型，整合语言感知嵌入和风格编码器，利用预训练语言模型提取歌词表示，并结合音高提取模型优化声学特征生成。

Result: 通过主客观评估，LAPS-Diff在低资源数据集上的表现显著优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: LAPS-Diff在低资源场景下有效提升了歌唱语音合成的自然度和表现力。

Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements
in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches.
However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and
language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in
low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion
model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided
learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We
curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract
word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation.
Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to
compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness
and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal
style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec
models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional
priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on
objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff
significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the
considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is
typical of the low resource scenario.

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural
variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex
scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce
AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable
generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines
a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics
system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned
distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code
generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The
system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering
ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular
genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration
reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export.
We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user
study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

Motivation: 早期药物发现中，基因表达响应的分布预测对理解基因功能和靶点识别至关重要，现有方法仅预测均值变化，忽略了单细胞数据的随机性。

Method: 通过建模表达分布预测基因水平直方图，结合大型语言模型（LLM）的基因嵌入知识，泛化到未见过的扰动。

Result: 模型在捕获高阶统计量（如方差、偏度和峰度）上优于基线，同时保持对均值变化的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为更丰富、更具生物学意义的扰动效应模型提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: We train a neural network to predict distributional responses in gene
expression following genetic perturbations. This is an essential task in
early-stage drug discovery, where such responses can offer insights into gene
function and inform target identification. Existing methods only predict
changes in the mean expression, overlooking stochasticity inherent in
single-cell data. In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular
responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level
histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing
higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a
fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we
incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models
(LLMs). While modeling a richer output space, the method remains competitive in
predicting mean expression changes. This work offers a practical step towards
more expressive and biologically informative models of perturbation effects.

Motivation: 研究Bittensor是否具备类似比特币的去中心化AI潜力，并解决其激励和安全问题。

Method: 利用64个活跃Bittensor子网的链上数据，分析权益和奖励分布，提出协议级干预措施。

Result: 发现权益和奖励高度集中，激励与质量不匹配，提出的改进方案（如绩效加权分配、权益上限）能有效提升安全性。

Conclusion: Bittensor目前存在激励和安全问题，但通过协议改进可实现更健康的生态系统。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of
decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics,
decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure
against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor
subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and
rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake,
highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a
remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions.
For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted
emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for
mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and
empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the
median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust
across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Motivation: 探讨多轮越狱攻击对安全对齐LLMs的影响，揭示其绕过防御的机制。

Method: 通过分析Crescendo多轮越狱攻击在模型中间表示层面的表现，研究其如何逐步引导模型输出。

Result: Crescendo攻击使模型将有害请求表示为无害，尤其在多轮对话中更明显，导致单轮防御失效。

Conclusion: 需开发针对多轮攻击的防御措施，弥补单轮防御的不足。

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses
remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only
closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a
significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We
study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of
intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often
represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the
number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each
turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of
representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful
requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses
like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks,
motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling
samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least
certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can
provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior
distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by
posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel
active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to
different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA
combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM,
SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural
Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning
approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular
task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in

TL;DR: 研究探索了交互式图可视化在隐私政策分析中的应用，通过结构化图模型和图形挖掘算法提升用户理解和识别潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私政策文件冗长复杂，非专业用户难以理解，导致个人数据处理透明度不足，需自动化工具提升透明度和风险识别。

Method: 采用交互式图可视化表示政策条款，结合图形挖掘算法（如t-SNE和PCA）识别关键主题并评估聚类效果。

Result: 基于图的聚类提高了政策内容的可解释性，揭示了用户跟踪和数据共享模式，支持法务调查和监管合规性识别。

Conclusion: 研究通过结合交互式可视化和图形挖掘，推动了AI驱动的隐私政策审计工具发展，增强了透明度和信任。

Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for
non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the
collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online
privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing
privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the
potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of
privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This
approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make
informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining
algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device
Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to
assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based
clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in
user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and
identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools
for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with
graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力参数矩阵标准差分布的鲁棒指纹方法，用于识别大语言模型的来源，并揭示了华为Pangu Pro MoE模型可能源自Qwen-2.5 14B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型训练成本增加和模型重用普及，版权和知识产权保护面临挑战，现有水印技术对持续训练的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 通过分析不同层注意力参数矩阵的标准差分布，发现其独特且稳定的模式，可作为模型指纹。

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性，并发现华为Pangu Pro MoE模型可能通过升级技术而非从头训练衍生自Qwen-2.5 14B模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模模型开发中的知识产权保护提供了鲁棒指纹技术，强调持续训练无法完全掩盖模型来源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant copyright and intellectual
property challenges as the cost of training increases and model reuse becomes
prevalent. While watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect model
ownership, they may not be robust to continue training and development, posing
serious threats to model attribution and copyright protection. This work
introduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based
on intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation
distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit
distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued
training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints
that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright
infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication. Notably,
our investigation uncovers evidence that a recently Pangu Pro MoE model
released by Huawei is derived from Qwen-2.5 14B model through upcycling
techniques rather than training from scratch, highlighting potential cases of
model plagiarism, copyright violation, and information fabrication. These
findings underscore the critical importance of developing robust fingerprinting
methods for protecting intellectual property in large-scale model development
and emphasize that deliberate continued training alone is insufficient to
completely obscure model origins.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过强化学习（RL）微调大型语言模型（LLMs）以改进其在软件漏洞检测中的表现，提出了一种基于Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）的方法，并通过实验验证了其优于传统监督微调（SFT）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在漏洞检测中存在局限性，如对某些漏洞类型过度预测而忽略其他类型，因此需要改进其训练动态和推理能力。

Method: 采用GRPO方法，通过结构化、基于规则的奖励信号重新定义优势函数和奖励信号，并利用BigVul、DiverseVul和CleanVul数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO在泛化能力、推理能力和性能上均优于传统的SFT方法。

Conclusion: RL-based训练方法（如GRPO）在提升LLMs的漏洞检测性能和推理能力方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based
security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we
present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning
techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as
their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing
to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for
guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its
application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage
functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the
field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing
multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization,
reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised
finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of
RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of
LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临时IoT环境中设备协作的安全性和易用性问题，特别是非专家用户难以手动实现细粒度访问控制策略的挑战。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的方法生成访问控制策略，基于能力授权和轻量级代理实现策略执行，提供硬件无关的抽象。

Result: LLM策略生成准确率达100%，新设备配置时间约150毫秒，网络和控制开销分别低于2毫秒和0.3毫秒。

Conclusion: CollabIoT在临时IoT环境中实现了高效、安全的设备协作，验证了其可行性和性能优势。

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and
actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services,
enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling
such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact
with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,
fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure
interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for
non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically
configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.
Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and
seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs
a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level
intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless
device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for
authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing
hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto
configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in
large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation
pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%
accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new
devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of
up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLM）在越狱攻击中的普遍现象——注意力滑移（Attention Slipping），并提出了一种新的防御方法——注意力锐化（Attention Sharpening），有效抵抗攻击且不影响正常任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会和技术中的重要性增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要。越狱攻击利用漏洞绕过安全防护，但相关机制尚不明确。

Method: 研究发现注意力滑移现象，并提出注意力锐化防御方法，通过温度缩放直接调整注意力分数分布。

Result: 实验表明，注意力锐化能有效抵抗多种越狱攻击，且在正常任务上保持性能，无额外计算或内存开销。

Conclusion: 注意力锐化为LLM安全提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and
technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit
vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.
However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this
paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:
Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the
attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack
process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is
consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token
replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.
Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token
Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention
Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of
mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,
a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the
attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four
leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)
show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while
maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention
Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it
an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了低精度量化对语言模型安全性的影响，提出了梯度引导攻击方法，发现不同量化方案对攻击成功率有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的安全性对齐至关重要，但直接参数操纵攻击（如故障注入）可能威胁其完整性。低精度量化的普及促使研究其对攻击效果的影响。

Method: 提出梯度引导攻击，包括渐进位级搜索算法和单词级攻击，评估了不同量化方案（FP16、FP8、INT8、INT4）下的攻击效果。

Result: FP16模型攻击成功率高（>80%），而FP8和INT8模型攻击成功率较低（<20%和50%）。INT4模型攻击成功率显著下降。量化后攻击的转移性也有所不同。

Conclusion: 常见量化方案（尤其是FP8）增加了攻击难度，但漏洞仍存在，特别是在量化后攻击转移时。

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet
their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks,
such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly
deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper
investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across
different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a
tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a
comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on
Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and
weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization
significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high
success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack
budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and
50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8
models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to
INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation
locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,
with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,
jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent
FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced
transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common
quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct
parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist,
especially through post-attack quantization.

Conclusion: AttackBench通过标准化评估条件，提高了对抗攻击评估的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion
attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often
remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched
models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can
lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness
claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a
false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation
reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess
the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible
conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack
implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers
and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in
subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing
conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for
robustness verification.

Motivation: 评估LLM和代理框架在真实开发环境中生成补丁的安全性，填补现有研究在现实场景中的空白。

Method: 使用SWE-bench数据集中的20,000多个问题，比较独立LLM（Llama 3.3）和开发者编写的补丁，并评估三种代理框架（OpenHands、AutoCodeRover、HoneyComb）生成的补丁安全性。

Result: 独立LLM引入的漏洞比开发者多9倍，代理框架在自主权较高时也易产生漏洞。漏洞多发生在涉及更多文件、代码行数较多或缺乏具体代码片段的问题中。

Conclusion: 上下文因素对生成代码的安全性至关重要，需开发主动风险评估方法，结合代码和问题信息以补充现有漏洞检测工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly
adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and
program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated
code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving
open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development
contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of
LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We
evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to
developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by
three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb)
on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and
project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents
are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the
standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,
with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.
Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,
particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the
likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find
that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a
higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that
lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and
steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a
critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need
for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and
issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.

<details>

Motivation: 准确的家族分类有助于自动化样本标记和理解，尤其是在VirusTotal和MalwareBazaar等平台上。

Method: 研究使用家族特定字符串（FSS）特征，类似RAG方法，开发了一个评估框架，涵盖67个家族的4,347个样本，分析了超过2500万字符串。

Result: 通过详细的消融研究，评估了四个主要模块中不同设计选择的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，传统字符串特征在LLMs和RAG时代仍可用于MFC，但需优化设计。

Abstract: Malware Family Classification (MFC) aims to identify the fine-grained family
(e.g., GuLoader or BitRAT) to which a potential malware sample belongs, in
contrast to malware detection or sample classification that predicts only an
Yes/No. Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample
labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as
VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In
this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary
string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how
Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to
RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework
covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25
million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of
different design choices in four major modules.

Motivation: 由于Transformer模型在安全关键领域的广泛应用及其高价值性，保护其推理过程中的数据和模型安全成为重要需求。现有TEE方案性能不足，而混合方案无法安全卸载关键操作。

Method: 提出TwinShield框架，支持在异构TEE和加速器系统中安全卸载Transformer推理的关键操作（如Attention和SoftMax），实现数据和模型的双重保护。

Result: TwinShield将约87%的计算卸载到GPU，性能提升4.0x - 6.1x，适用于多种Transformer模型。

Conclusion: TwinShield为安全高效的Transformer推理提供了可行方案，解决了现有方法的性能和安全限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer models, e.g., large language models (LLMs),
have brought tremendous breakthroughs in various artificial intelligence (AI)
tasks, leading to their wide applications in many security-critical domains.
Due to their unprecedented scale and prohibitively high development cost, these
models have become highly valuable intellectual property for AI stakeholders
and are increasingly deployed via machine learning as a service (MLaaS).
However, MLaaS often runs on untrusted cloud infrastructure, exposing data and
models to potential breaches. Mainstream protection mechanisms leverage trusted
execution environments (TEEs) where confidentiality and integrity for secretive
data are shielded using hardware-based encryption and integrity checking.
Unfortunately, running model inference entirely within TEEs is subject to
non-trivial slowdown, which is further exacerbated in LLMs due to the
substantial computation and memory footprint involved. Recent studies reveal
that the hybrid TEE-based scheme offloading partial model inference operations
to the untrusted accelerators (e.g., GPU) is a promising solution. However,
prior offloading schemes fail to ensure dual protection of data and model in
Transformer inference, as they cannot securely offload critical operations,
i.e., Attention and SoftMax, forcing these computations to remain confined
within TEEs. To address these challenges, we propose TwinShield, a framework
enabling secure Transformer inference in heterogeneous TEE and accelerator
systems with dual protection for both model and data. TwinShield offloads ~87%
of computation to GPUs and delivers 4.0x - 6.1x speedups over previous
approaches across various Transformer models.

Conclusion: 论文提出了防御框架和基于任务向量的检测方法，为CL安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data
poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional
manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning
models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While
existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we
propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP)
threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP
adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous
and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task
within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent
conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image
corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole
continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on
past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm.
Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison
task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at
https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .

Conclusion: 论文揭示了移动GUI代理的安全隐患，并探讨了提升其鲁棒性的挑战与机遇。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are designed to autonomously execute diverse device-control
tasks by interpreting and interacting with mobile screens. Despite notable
advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may
be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely
unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are
vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of
mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework
AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen
content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution
environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling
over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58
reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content,
while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14
popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to
be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile
GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings
reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading
third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted
attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the
employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess
training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and
opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and
data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.

Abstract: The persistent threat of Android malware presents a serious challenge to the
security of millions of users globally. While many machine learning-based
methods have been developed to detect these threats, their reliance on large
labeled datasets limits their effectiveness against emerging, previously unseen
malware families, for which labeled data is scarce or nonexistent.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a novel zero-shot learning framework
that combines Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) with Siamese Neural
Networks (SNN) to identify malware without needing prior examples of specific
malware families. Our approach leverages graph-based representations of Android
applications, enabling the model to detect subtle structural differences
between benign and malicious software, even in the absence of labeled data for
new threats.
  Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
MaMaDroid, especially in zero-day malware detection. Our model achieves 96.24%
accuracy and 95.20% recall for unknown malware families, highlighting its
robustness against evolving Android threats.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality malware datasets that
support advanced analysis techniques, particularly machine learning and agentic
AI frameworks. Existing datasets often lack diversity, comprehensive labelling,
and the complexity necessary for effective machine learning and agent-based AI
training. To fill this gap, we developed a systematic approach for generating a
dataset that combines automated malware execution in controlled virtual
environments with dynamic monitoring tools. The resulting dataset comprises
clean and infected memory snapshots across multiple malware families and
operating systems, capturing detailed behavioural and environmental features.
Key design decisions include applying ethical and legal compliance, thorough
validation using both automated and manual methods, and comprehensive
documentation to ensure replicability and integrity. The dataset's distinctive
features enable modelling system states and transitions, facilitating RL-based
malware detection and response strategies. This resource is significant for
advancing adaptive cybersecurity defences and digital forensic research. Its
scope supports diverse malware scenarios and offers potential for broader
applications in incident response and automated threat mitigation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EUPG的高效机器学习遗忘框架，结合隐私模型提供正式隐私保障，同时降低计算和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR等隐私保护法要求从机器学习模型中删除个人数据，现有方法要么成本高，要么缺乏隐私保障。

Method: EUPG通过预训练基于隐私模型保护的数据，实现高效遗忘并保留隐私保障。

Result: 在四种数据集上的实验表明，EUPG在效用和遗忘效果上与精确遗忘方法相当，但成本显著降低。

Conclusion: EUPG是一种高效且具有隐私保障的机器学习遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Privacy protection laws, such as the GDPR, grant individuals the right to
request the forgetting of their personal data not only from databases but also
from machine learning (ML) models trained on them. Machine unlearning has
emerged as a practical means to facilitate model forgetting of data instances
seen during training. Although some existing machine unlearning methods
guarantee exact forgetting, they are typically costly in computational terms.
On the other hand, more affordable methods do not offer forgetting guarantees
and are applicable only to specific ML models. In this paper, we present
\emph{efficient unlearning with privacy guarantees} (EUPG), a novel machine
unlearning framework that offers formal privacy guarantees to individuals whose
data are being unlearned. EUPG involves pre-training ML models on data
protected using privacy models, and it enables {\em efficient unlearning with
the privacy guarantees offered by the privacy models in use}. Through empirical
evaluation on four heterogeneous data sets protected with $k$-anonymity and
$\epsilon$-differential privacy as privacy models, our approach demonstrates
utility and forgetting effectiveness comparable to those of exact unlearning
methods, while significantly reducing computational and storage costs. Our code
is available at https://github.com/najeebjebreel/EUPG.

Method: 研究结合LLMs作为处理器、检测器和解释器，构建AI驱动的NIDS流程，并提出LLM为中心的控制器概念。

Result: LLMs能够提升NIDS的上下文推理、可解释决策和自动化响应能力，优化系统性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在下一代网络安全系统中具有变革潜力，有望推动可靠、自适应和可解释NIDS的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their
exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating
human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges,
methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a
foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling
technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in
AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep
learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack
contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate
LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper
contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for
intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting
LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven
NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is
proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection
workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this
paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster
innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By
presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire
advancement in next-generation network security systems.

Result: 大规模实验揭示了攻击与防御在实际条件下的未知局限性和失败模式。

Conclusion: BackFed为研究者提供了可靠评估工具，并为提升联邦学习安全性提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model
updates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and
defenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and
unrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce
BackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline,
and reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on
practical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its
multi-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation
and the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via
well-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed
as a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably
evaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale
studies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer
Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures
and experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of
proposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of
failures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable
guidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of
FL systems. Our framework is openly available at

Method: 提出9种知识中毒攻击分类和两种新型威胁向量（内容混淆和内容注入），开发自动化工具包测试5种数据加载器和6种端到端RAG系统。

Result: 实验结果显示攻击成功率为74.4%，验证了RAG系统在文档加载阶段的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 强调了保护RAG系统文档加载过程免受隐蔽内容操纵的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since
ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a
key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge.
However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new
vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading
stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by
exploiting document ingestion.
  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce
two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection --
targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit
implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data
loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further
validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box
pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants --
demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass
filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the
urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against
covert content manipulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OEE是制造业的关键绩效指标，但其波动性使得短期预测复杂化，需要更精确的方法。

Method: 将OEE数据分解为趋势、季节性和残差成分，用SARIMAX建模残差，并结合统计描述和拓扑特征。采用混合特征选择策略优化输入空间。

Result: 模型在多个生产系统中表现优于传统时间序列模型和基于Transformer的方法，误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 结合经典预测和拓扑数据分析显著提升了OEE预测精度，有助于主动维护和生产决策。

Abstract: Purpose: Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is a key manufacturing KPI, but
its volatile nature complicates short-term forecasting. This study presents a
novel framework combining time series decomposition and topological data
analysis to improve OEE prediction across various equipment, such as hydraulic
press systems.
  Methods: The approach begins by decomposing hourly OEE data into trend,
seasonal, and residual components. The residual, capturing short-term
variability, is modeled using a seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables
(SARIMAX). These exogenous features include statistical descriptors and
topological summaries from related time series. To manage the high-dimensional
input space, we propose a hybrid feature selection strategy using recursive
feature elimination based on statistically significant SARIMAX predictors,
coupled with BIC-guided particle swarm optimization. The framework is evaluated
on real-world datasets from multiple production systems.
  Results: The proposed model consistently outperforms conventional time series
models and advanced transformer-based approaches, achieving significantly lower
mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error.
  Conclusion: Integrating classical forecasting with topological data analysis
enhances OEE prediction accuracy, enabling proactive maintenance and informed
production decisions in complex manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种高效量子核方法，显著减少处理高维数据所需的量子比特和纠缠门数量，提升计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子核方法在处理高维数据时，因纠缠门数量随数据维度二次增长而不实用，需改进以适配实际量子设备。

Method: 设计新型量子核，减少量子比特和纠缠操作，保留数据特征，通过数值模拟和实验验证其性能。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有量子特征映射，计算资源需求更低，且在噪声环境下仍有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子机器学习在近未来量子计算平台上的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional
data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or
feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently
impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the
dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a
quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly
reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves
essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as
evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a
marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to
state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined
with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function
within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through
numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting
circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on
par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our
findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum
machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将量子算法应用于资源约束的赌博机模型，为运筹学提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines
aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical
algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret
bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In
this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum
computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via
quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent
regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we
demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a
factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget
constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of
a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent
setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear
programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of
the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time
complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared
to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is
the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed
light on operations research.

Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical
and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and
quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common
linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural
language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and
cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and
drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a
small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning
about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide
normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical
notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we
discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,
and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form
methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to
additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple
counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We
also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility
relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such
as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the
architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and
syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of
logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the
qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical
findings in cognitive science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构预测的基准测试在评估模型在生物挑战性环境（如内在无序区域）中的表现不足，限制了其在药物发现等应用中的实用性。

Method: DisProtBench通过三个关键维度（数据复杂性、任务多样性和可解释性）评估12种领先的蛋白质结构预测模型。

Result: 结果显示模型在无序条件下的表现存在显著差异，全局准确性指标在无序环境中无法预测任务性能。

Conclusion: DisProtBench为下一代蛋白质结构预测模型提供了一个可重复、可扩展且基于生物学的评估框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction have achieved near-atomic
accuracy for well-folded proteins. However, current benchmarks inadequately
assess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those
involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in
applications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and
protein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural
disorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:
(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking
twelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,
regression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the
DisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error
analyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under
disorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.
Notably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in
disordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.
DisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded
framework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决TNOs颜色起源的争议，探讨其是否反映形成条件或后续碰撞演化。

Method: 采用模型无关、数据驱动的因果图方法，无需轨道建模或物理假设。

Result: 模型预测TNOs颜色是其倾角分布的根源，且颜色主要为原始特征，排除了后续辐射显著改变颜色的假说。

Conclusion: TNOs的颜色主要反映其原始形成位置，而非后续演化过程。

Abstract: The origins of the colors of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a
crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar
System. Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the
eccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the
long-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO
formation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address
this question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven
approach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how
our model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical
history, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.
In fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)
predicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then
show how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is
the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way
around. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying
dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal
model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification
by subsequent irradiation. We therefore conclude that the colors of TNOs are
predominantly primordial.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Matrix Tile Extension (MTE)，一种新型矩阵指令集架构，解决了现有矩阵ISA在运行GEMM时的性能不足问题，并实现了1.35倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矩阵ISA在运行GEMM时性能不足，尤其是对小、高或瘦矩阵的处理不够灵活，无法动态适应应用特定需求。

Method: 提出MTE，通过完全解耦指令集架构与微架构，并引入少量额外指令和64位CSR，实现三维向量化GEMM和灵活的瓦片形状。

Result: MTE在运行常见卷积和Transformer模型时，性能优于现有矩阵ISA，加速比为1.35倍。

Conclusion: MTE是一种高效且灵活的矩阵ISA，显著提升了GEMM性能，同时实现简单。

Abstract: GEneral Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) are recurrent in high-performance
computing and deep learning workloads. Typically, high-end CPUs accelerate GEMM
workloads with Single-Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) or vector Instruction
Set Architectures (ISAs). Since these ISAs face significant issues when running
GEMM workloads, particularly when dealing with small, tall, or skinny matrices,
matrix ISAs have been proposed and implemented by major hardware vendors in the
last years. Although these matrix ISAs deliver larger throughput when running
GEMMs than their SIMD/vector counterparts, they are rigid solutions unable to
dynamically adapt themselves to application-specific aspects like the data
format. This paper demonstrates that the state-of-the-art matrix ISAs deliver
suboptimal performance when running the most commonly used convolution and
transformer models.
  This paper proposes the Matrix Tile Extension (MTE), the first matrix ISA
that completely decouples the instruction set architecture from the
microarchitecture and seamlessly interacts with existing vector ISAs. MTE
incurs minimal implementation overhead since it only requires a few additional
instructions and a 64-bit Control Status Register (CSR) to keep its state.
Specifically, MTE can i) vectorize GEMMs across the three dimensions M, N, and
K; ii) leverage the capacity of the existing vector register file; and iii)
decouple the tile shape from the underlying microarchitecture. MTE achieves
speed-ups of 1.35x over the best state-of-the-art matrix ISA.

Motivation: 在CERN大型强子对撞机等需要微秒级延迟的神经网络部署中，面积占用是关键瓶颈，尤其是CMVM操作。

Method: 采用分布式算术（DA）在FPGA上实现CMVM，优化面积和延迟，算法开源并集成到hls4ml库中。

Result: 算法在高度量化神经网络中减少片上资源达三分之一，同时降低延迟，实现之前不可行的网络部署。

Conclusion: 该算法显著提升了FPGA上神经网络的部署效率，为高延迟要求的应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Neural networks with a latency requirement on the order of microseconds, like
the ones used at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, are typically deployed on
FPGAs fully unrolled and pipelined. A bottleneck for the deployment of such
neural networks is area utilization, which is directly related to the required
constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) operations. In this work, we
propose an efficient algorithm for implementing CMVM operations with
distributed arithmetic (DA) on FPGAs that simultaneously optimizes for area
consumption and latency. The algorithm achieves resource reduction similar to
state-of-the-art algorithms while being significantly faster to compute. The
proposed algorithm is open-sourced and integrated into the \texttt{hls4ml}
library, a free and open-source library for running real-time neural network
inference on FPGAs. We show that the proposed algorithm can reduce on-chip
resources by up to a third for realistic, highly quantized neural networks
while simultaneously reducing latency, enabling the implementation of
previously infeasible networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高假设检验的可复现性以增强信任，并与算法稳定性、泛化和隐私性建立联系。

Method: 构建通用工具证明样本复杂度的上下界，规范化算法性质，优化基于测试统计量的设计策略。

Result: 改进了均匀性、同一性和接近性检验的下界，实现了硬币检验和接近性检验的常数因子最优界，并在多项式时间内完成了高斯均值检验。

Conclusion: 通过规范化性质和优化设计策略，可复现算法在多种检验问题中实现了高效和性能提升。

Abstract: A hypothesis testing algorithm is replicable if, when run on two different
samples from the same distribution, it produces the same output with high
probability. This notion, defined by by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorell
[STOC'22], can increase trust in testing procedures and is deeply related to
algorithmic stability, generalization, and privacy. We build general tools to
prove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers,
unifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.
  We identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable
testing algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening
accuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a
deterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds
against a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in
which the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,''
then the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,
resolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower
bounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case
where the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.
  We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm
design based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.
Our framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the
non-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead. As direct
applications of our framework, we obtain constant-factor optimal bounds for
coin testing and closeness testing and get replicability for free in a large
parameter regime for uniformity testing.
  We also give state-of-the-art bounds for replicable Gaussian mean testing,
and, unlike prior work, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.

Motivation: 物联网设备分布广泛且易受攻击，需要频繁认证，但传统方法效率低且影响网络性能。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）优化无人机的飞行轨迹、设备选择和充电计划。

Result: 仿真结果显示，平均信任年龄降低88%，认证导致的吞吐量损失减少30%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了物联网设备认证中的效率与性能平衡问题。

Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across
vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications.
Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and
motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and
study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in
IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is
optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as
possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are
offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another
challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy
arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the
UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices
to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our
solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to
attestation by 30%.

Abstract: Many e-learning platforms assert their ability or potential to improve
students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected
nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for
representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply
SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students'
SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the
causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that
these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further
research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.

Method: 使用201个大学STEM问题数据集，标注多种特征，评估四种AI模型家族和五种提示策略，并与546名学生回答对比。

Result: 最佳AI模型平均正确率58.5%，但人类在视觉问题上表现更优；AI表现受学科和问题特征影响，而人类表现稳定。

Conclusion: 通过优化问题设计，可以在不增加学生负担的情况下挑战AI，提升学术诚信。

Abstract: Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input
capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these
advancements could influence assessment design and question answering,
presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we
introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions,
manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity,
and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI
performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five
prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses
per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of
the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently
outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human
performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject,
whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question
features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating
how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that
challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for
students.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various
domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising
questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This
study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)
dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science
competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived
such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for
others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The
Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical
programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current
LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),
providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition
settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding
educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM
usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and
policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly
available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational
application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using
the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨英国如何在促进AI创新与管控风险之间找到平衡，以展示民主社会如何利用AI的益处并管理其风险。

Method: 分析英国AI监管的历史演变，提出设立原则性监管机构、更新法律框架等具体建议。

Result: 英国在AI监管上取得一定进展，但仍需填补前沿AI开发监管的空白，并应对新兴风险。

Conclusion: 英国若成功制定合适的AI监管框架，可为民主社会在AI时代的发展提供示范。

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than
the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a
global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from
companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about
catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time
focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved
into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing
regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but
avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived
in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The
UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and
hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -
refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new
government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the
time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:
harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating
risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based
regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures
against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more
technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated
misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,
discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but
important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic
societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.

Method: 分析研究员电脑中的文本数据（如文章、邮件、草稿），估计约100万字的训练数据，用于微调GPT-4等模型。

Result: 研究表明，AI可以高保真地复制研究员的写作风格、专业知识和修辞特点，并可通过非文本数据进一步丰富。

Conclusion: AI驱动的“电子副本”为智力遗产保存提供了新机会，但需重视所有权和安全等伦理问题。

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a
deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored
in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited
researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and
drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for
AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained
models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise,
and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential
enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the
AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include
communication between living researchers and their electronic copies,
collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and
interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information
access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership
and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for
responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for
AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆的定义和能力存在概念性差距，无法涵盖未来以人为中心的移动系统所需的认知和社交能力。

Method: 提出系统级框架，结合代理AI、机器人技术、多智能体系统和人机交互，分析AgVs的认知与通信层。

Result: 框架展示了代理AI如何作为交互代理嵌入移动生态系统，而不仅是计算工具。

Conclusion: 开发AgVs面临安全、实时控制、公众接受度、伦理对齐和监管框架等关键挑战。

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity
to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly,
autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their
environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.
However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase
vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE
levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,
contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly
with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.
These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the
broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered
mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles
(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and
interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level
framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative
layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant
advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine
interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and
tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive
agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key
challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety,
real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory
frameworks.

Method: 整合街道网络、街景图像和社交媒体数据，利用SHAP分析分类街道剥夺模式。

Result: 老城区以基础设施限制为主，新开发区则存在体验性剥夺；模拟显示针对性改进可提升14%的运动支持性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅将Lefebvre理论操作化，还为空间正义和城市健康公平提供了行动指南。

Abstract: Urban streets are essential public spaces that facilitate everyday physical
activity and promote health equity. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's spatial triad,
this study proposes a conceptual and methodological framework to quantify
street-level exercise deprivation through the dimensions of conceived (planning
and structure), perceived (visual and sensory), and lived (practice and
experiential) urban spaces. We integrate multi-source spatial data-including
street networks, street-view imagery, and social media-using explainable
machine learning (SHAP analysis) to classify streets by their dominant
deprivation modes, forming a novel typology of spatial inequity. Results
highlight significant differences across urban contexts: older city cores
predominantly experience infrastructural constraints (conceived space), whereas
new development areas suffer from experiential disengagement (lived space).
Furthermore, by identifying spatial mismatches between population distribution
and exercise intensity, our study reveals localized clusters of latent
deprivation. Simulation experiments demonstrate that targeted improvements
across spatial dimensions can yield up to 14% increases in exercise
supportiveness. This research not only operationalizes Lefebvre's spatial
theory at the street scale but also provides actionable insights and
intervention guidelines, contributing to the broader goals of spatial justice
and urban health equity.

Motivation: 随着AI热潮持续，企业面临夸大或淡化AI使用的压力，研究旨在揭示这种虚假宣传对消费者的影响及其伦理意义。

Method: 采用2x2实验设计（N=401），分析虚假夸大和虚假否认对消费者态度和购买意图的影响，并通过感知背叛中介效应解释结果。

Result: 虚假否认比诚实否认引发更负面的道德判断，而虚假夸大无显著影响；感知背叛是中介因素。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI-washing如何侵蚀信任，为政策制定者、营销人员和研究者提供了透明化的伦理启示。

Abstract: As AI hype continues to grow, organizations face pressure to broadcast or
downplay purported AI initiatives - even when contrary to truth. This paper
introduces AI-washing as overstating (deceptive boasting) or understating
(deceptive denial) a company's real AI usage. A 2x2 experiment (N = 401)
examines how these false claims affect consumer attitudes and purchase
intentions. Results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: deceptive denial evokes more
negative moral judgments than honest negation, while deceptive boasting has no
effects. We show that perceived betrayal mediates these outcomes. By clarifying
how AI-washing erodes trust, the study highlights clear ethical implications
for policymakers, marketers, and researchers striving for transparency.

Abstract: Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI
agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial
intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this
growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine,
psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest
sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four
sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two
theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new
insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook
sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic
discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines
individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional
dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory,
fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of
chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by
leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to
cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance
communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value
of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot
interaction and developing chatbots for social good.

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by
human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in
tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating
human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and
aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA
fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert
AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D
printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA
fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic
preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic
appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration
in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human
feedback into AI design processes.

### [545] [Preference-Optimal Multi-Metric Weighting for Parallel Coordinate Plots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02905)
*Chisa Mori,Shuhei Watanabe,Masaki Onishi,Takayuki Itoh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户偏好的多指标平行坐标图（PCPs）优化权重计算方法，并通过雷达图和UMAP降维实现直观可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCPs仅能基于单一指标进行颜色渐变，无法有效处理多指标情况，且线性加权方法对用户不透明。

Method: 提出一种基于特定偏好指标组合的优化权重计算方法，使用雷达图和UMAP降维在二维平面上直观展示指标权衡。

Result: 在行人流引导规划中，该方法成功识别了不同用户偏好下控制参数的重要性模式。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多指标PCPs的权重计算和可视化问题，提升了用户对参数与指标关系的理解。

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the
relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an
interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is
challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present.
Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly
weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this
problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal
weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can
simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric
problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them
to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to
visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the
analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique
patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 大多数参与者认为该系统支持患者风险评估和推荐。

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate
AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key
limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific
evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines
interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk
assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned
language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models
(LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI
explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to
support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a
mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the
conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear
understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific
evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported
that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字人类创建的瓶颈在于生成与文本或语音输入自然对应的角色动作，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，结合快速文本转录作为语义条件，实现情感引导的无分类器扩散，并使用轻量级Transformer架构融合多模态特征。

Result: 在ZeroEGGS数据集上评估，DeepGesture在手势的人类相似度和上下文适当性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepGesture在情感状态插值和泛化能力上表现出色，推动了多模态情感感知数字人类的发展。

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware
digital humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过界面设计鼓励用户为AI助手生成更长提示，以增强用户对生成内容的所有权感。

Method: 采用两种交互技术（长按提交按钮和滑动滑块）进行实验，并进一步测试AI生成扩展建议的效果。

Result: 实验显示这些技术显著增加提示长度并提升心理所有权，但AI建议仅增加长度，未提升所有权感。

Conclusion: 简单界面修改可有效促使用户输入更多内容并增强心理所有权。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of large language models
(LLMs) in UI/UX design, synthesizing findings from 38 peer-reviewed studies
published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4,
Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from
ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering,
human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping
design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and
limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging
collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive,
and effective integration of these technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在心理学研究中广泛应用，但测量不可靠性（如人格评估崩溃、道德偏好反转等）威胁研究有效性。

Method: 基于双效度框架，提出六阶段工作流程，包括明确研究目标、验证计算工具、控制实验设计、透明执行、适当数据分析及结果报告。

Result: 通过系统验证，工作流程能区分真实计算现象与测量伪影，为AI心理学研究提供稳健基础。

Conclusion: 该工作流程通过建立验证工具和透明实践，为LLMs在心理学研究中的有效应用提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through
an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic
validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement
artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent
practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical
foundation for AI psychology research.

TL;DR: Reverger是一款AI驱动的创意支持工具，通过灵活迭代发散和收敛过程，帮助用户生成故事修改的多样化概念方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI创意工具缺乏对发散和收敛过程的复杂协调支持，而人类创意构思需要这两者的结合。

Method: Reverger通过递归探索故事修改的高层方向（发散）和将这些方向合成为具体变体（收敛），支持用户迭代操作。

Result: 研究表明，Reverger用户能探索更多意外且多样化的方向，并感到有更精细的控制和更有价值的成果。

Conclusion: Reverger通过支持灵活的发散和收敛迭代，提升了创意构思的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas
(divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent
combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are
often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools
(CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and
convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate
variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding
flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool
enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for
modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows
users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into
concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence
until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that
Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse
high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that
they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育工具中的普及，研究其交互方式对用户表现的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，15名高中生在不同交互风格下完成编程任务，并进行定量分析。

Result: 协作交互风格显著优于被动和主动风格，任务完成时间更短，用户满意度更高。

Conclusion: LLM的交互设计应注重互动性和用户中心化，尤其是对新手程序员。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and
programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should
interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles
with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance
on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where
fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under
three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a
specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions
automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative
analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly
improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions.
Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when
working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an
LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact
learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing
LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive,
adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.

Motivation: 探讨社交机器人在与人类互动中面临的挑战，强调以人为本的设计理念。

Method: 基于以人为本的AI原则，提出“双金字塔”框架，分类人类与机器人互动的需求。

Result: “双金字塔”框架首次全面涵盖从微观到宏观的人类需求，包括机器人效能和社会可持续发展目标。

Conclusion: 社交机器人需以人为本，新框架为设计提供了全面指导。

Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from
the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the
Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the
introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0),
challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading
researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots
must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims
to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from
short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level
needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI,
this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs
called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of
human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot
effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with
robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏对用户和社区价值的充分考虑，导致信任危机和合法性缺失，需要一种新方法来支持价值多元化和用户代理。

Method: 提出Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP)框架，通过社区定义的价值配置和动态生态系统实现价值协商，用户保留对AI行为的最终控制权。

Result: CDAVP框架能够支持多元价值、增强用户代理，并通过透明性和民主化规则提升AI系统的合法性和信任度。

Conclusion: 通过CDAVP框架，可以实现更具包容性和动态性的AI系统设计，为算法问责和以人为本的AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
(CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value
pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,
top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This
leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded
in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy
and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),
a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design
problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic
ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables
diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value
profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only
preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are
then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control
(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,
are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,
adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The
designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect
of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a
necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and
genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讨价还价游戏是研究经济行为的重要工具，但现有算法收敛性研究不足，尤其是在简单案例（如最后通牒游戏）中。

Method: 使用FTRL算法，分析其在最后通牒游戏中的收敛性，并通过实验验证多轮讨价还价游戏中的结果。

Result: FTRL在最后通牒游戏中近似收敛到纳什均衡，且实验表明其在多种初始条件下均有效。

Conclusion: FTRL算法在更广泛的游戏中收敛，揭示了简单学习算法能产生复杂经济行为。

Abstract: Bargaining games, where agents attempt to agree on how to split utility, are
an important class of games used to study economic behavior, which motivates a
study of online learning algorithms in these games. In this work, we tackle
when no-regret learning algorithms converge to Nash equilibria in bargaining
games. Recent results have shown that online algorithms related to Follow the
Regularized Leader (FTRL) converge to Nash equilibria (NE) in the last iterate
in a wide variety of games, including zero-sum games. However, bargaining games
do not have the properties used previously to established convergence
guarantees, even in the simplest case of the ultimatum game, which features a
single take-it-or-leave-it offer. Nonetheless, we establish that FTRL (without
the modifications necessary for zero-sum games) achieves last-iterate
convergence to an approximate NE in the ultimatum game along with a bound on
convergence time under mild assumptions. Further, we provide experimental
results to demonstrate that convergence to NE, including NE with asymmetric
payoffs, occurs under a broad range of initial conditions, both in the
ultimatum game and in bargaining games with multiple rounds. This work
demonstrates how complex economic behavior (e.g. learning to use threats and
the existence of many possible equilibrium outcomes) can result from using a
simple learning algorithm, and that FTRL can converge to equilibria in a more
diverse set of games than previously known.

TL;DR: LLM-SAEA提出了一种基于大语言模型的动态选择策略，用于优化代理辅助进化算法中的代理模型和填充采样标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有效的动态选择策略需要大量领域知识和人工努力，LLM-SAEA旨在通过大语言模型自动完成这一过程。

Method: 采用协作专家框架，一个LLM负责评分（LLM-SE），另一个LLM负责决策（LLM-DE），动态选择最优配置。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-SAEA在标准测试案例中优于多种先进算法。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA通过集成大语言模型，显著提升了代理辅助进化算法的效率和性能。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds
of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic
field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training
algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric
recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic
field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated
system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial
conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional
viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can
obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field,
without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or
massive training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的剪枝方法无法直接以动态变化的SynOps为约束，导致最终网络可能违反预期目标。

Method: 提出SPEAR框架，结合LRE机制预测SynOps，并通过TAR奖励稳定搜索过程。

Conclusion: SPEAR为资源受限的神经形态硬件部署提供了一种高效的SNN剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种历史动态不应期（HDRP）模型，用于低延迟脉冲神经网络（SNN），通过动态调整不应期时长和阈值依赖性核来提升噪声抵抗力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不应期机制在低延迟SNN中效果不佳，可能导致神经元过度激活和系统对噪声的鲁棒性降低。

Method: 提出HDRP模型，利用膜电位导数和历史不应期估计初始不应期，并动态调整其时长；引入阈值依赖性核以减少神经元状态积累。

Result: HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余脉冲，在静态和神经形态数据集上达到SOTA准确率，噪声抵抗力优于传统SNN和人工神经网络（ANN）。

Conclusion: HDRP机制对提升低延迟SNN性能至关重要。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SESLR的新型在线持续学习方法，结合睡眠增强的潜在重放方案和脉冲神经网络（SNNs），显著降低内存开销并减少对新任务的分类偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算场景需要硬件高效的在线持续学习算法以适应动态环境，但现有算法存在内存开销高和对新任务偏差的问题。

Method: SESLR利用SNNs的二进制脉冲特性将重放特征存储为单比特，并通过噪声增强的睡眠阶段训练重放样本以减少偏差。

Result: 在Split CIFAR10上，SESLR的平均准确率提高了近30%，内存消耗仅为基线方法的三分之一；在Split CIFAR10-DVS上，准确率提高约10%，内存开销减少32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR是一种在资源受限的边缘计算场景中有效的在线持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（如GPT-4-mini）在算法发现中的潜力，理解其生成的优化算法在行为空间中的动态特性。

Method: 使用LLaMEA框架，通过不同变异提示策略生成六种算法变体，并在BBOB基准测试中评估其性能，结合行为指标和可视化工具进行分析。

Result: 采用代码简化和随机扰动提示的变体表现最佳，表现出更强的开发行为和更快收敛。行为空间分析揭示了算法性能差异的原因。

Conclusion: 行为空间分析为未来设计自适应LLM驱动的算法生成器提供了指导，展示了LLM在复杂算法搜索空间中的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms
automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery
methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework
with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation
heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA
variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and
analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration,
exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse
these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis
combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features,
performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks.
The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm
structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both
a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist
evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over
the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that
higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and
faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how
behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics
outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the
open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide
insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm
generators.

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working
mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under
the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to
understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what
role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to
address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a
handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a
promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the
results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a
model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large
context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per
query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the
experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim
was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do
mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do
mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject
matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a
large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further
use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first
PMP study making extensive use of LLM methods, it also seeks to begin a
conversation about these methods as research tools in practice-oriented
philosophy and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current models for
such work.

TL;DR: 研究开发了可解释的深度学习模型，结合临床数据和影像学特征，预测大血管闭塞中风患者的功能性结果和个体化治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机械取栓已成为大血管闭塞中风的标准治疗，但仅50%成功治疗患者预后良好。研究旨在通过深度学习模型提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用449名患者的临床数据和影像学特征（NCCT和CTA），结合新型基础模型，开发深度学习模型。

Result: 临床变量对预测功能性结果有较好效果（AUC 0.719），加入CTA影像后略有提升（AUC 0.737）。NCCT或联合影像未带来额外提升。个体化治疗效果预测能力有限。

Conclusion: 模型整合了影像和临床数据，实现了先进的预测性能，但个体化治疗效果估计仍需改进。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.

TL;DR: EdgeSRIE是一种轻量级深度学习框架，用于便携式超声成像中的实时斑点抑制和图像增强，具有高效的计算性能和实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像中的斑点模式会掩盖解剖细节，导致诊断不确定性。现有深度学习方法计算成本高，难以在低资源设备上应用。

Method: EdgeSRIE包含两个分支：无监督去斑点分支和去模糊分支，网络量化后部署在低功耗SoC上。

Result: 在性能评估中，EdgeSRIE在CNR和AGM上优于其他基线方法，并实现60帧/秒的实时推理。

Conclusion: EdgeSRIE在资源有限的环境中实现了高质量的实时超声成像。

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details,
leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based
techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their
high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as
portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a
lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image
enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed
framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch,
which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a
deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware
implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and
deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption.
In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE
achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient
magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based
methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time
inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational
requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These
results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality
ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典匹配在MRF中计算和内存成本随参数增加呈指数增长，限制了多参数映射的可扩展性。

Method: 提出GAST-Mamba框架，结合双Mamba编码器和GAST处理器，利用结构化状态空间模型高效捕获长程空间依赖。

Result: 在5倍加速模拟MRF数据上，T1 PSNR达33.12 dB，优于SCQ；T2映射PSNR为30.62 dB，SSIM为0.9124。体内实验显示解剖细节改进和伪影减少。

Conclusion: GAST-Mamba为高欠采样MRF提供准确、鲁棒的重建，是可扩展的传统字典匹配替代方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging by
matching signal evolutions to a predefined dictionary. However, conventional
dictionary matching suffers from exponential growth in computational cost and
memory usage as the number of parameters increases, limiting its scalability to
multi-parametric mapping. To address this, recent work has explored deep
learning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an
end-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware
Spatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our
architecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear
complexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba
achieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping,
it reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further
demonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies
confirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module
being particularly important under strong undersampling. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust
reconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable
alternative to traditional DM-based methods.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶叠层成像通过改变照明角度或相机位置引入多样性，但成本高且复杂。

Method: 通过目标运动生成测量多样性，并提出基于学习的方法从双平面强度测量估计k空间坐标。

Result: 在仿真和桌面光学系统中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了测量过程，同时保持了成像性能。

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture
imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide
field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of
low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is
introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the
camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's
spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and
complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes
changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates
measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a
novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane
intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without
knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in
simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

Thus, the diagnosis of COVID using CT scans has been effective in assisting
with RT-PCR diagnosis and severity classifications. In this paper, we proposed
a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on

Method: 提出Surg-SegFormer，一种无需用户提示的新型模型，优于现有技术。

Result: 在EndoVis2018和EndoVis2017数据集上分别达到0.80和0.54的mIoU。

Conclusion: Surg-SegFormer能自动理解复杂手术场景，提升住院医师的独立学习能力。

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables
surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools,
and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm
intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide
detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This
challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to
trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones
inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a
solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.
However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,
rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an
hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel
prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.
Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the
EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust
and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces
the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for
patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated
during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training
sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive
language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for
surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves
reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement
of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has
shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions,
texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.
CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic
context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL
module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through
iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018
and EndoVis 2017 datasets. CLIP-RL achieved a mean IoU of 81%, outperforming
state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This
superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive
learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.

Motivation: 解决全切片图像（WSI）因尺寸过大而计算不可行的问题，同时减少专家细粒度标注的需求。

Method: 结合轻量级分层注意力多实例学习（MIL）模型学习特征，并通过强化学习智能采样高分辨率区域。

Result: SASHA在计算和内存成本显著降低的情况下，性能与全高分辨率分析方法相当，优于稀疏采样方法。

Conclusion: SASHA为医学图像自动诊断提供了一种高效的智能采样解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology.
Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering
it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution.
Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert
annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive.
Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small
fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full
resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based
{\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep
reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological
images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight
hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second,
SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction
(10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show
that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at
high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs.
In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods.
We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging
challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images
containing sparsely informative features.

Result: 揭示了‘可检测性与耐久性之间的权衡’，并通过SwaGen生成了优化这一权衡的新型空间配置。

Conclusion: SwaGen模型可用于设计鲁棒的人工群体，并加深对自然群体动态的理解。

Abstract: Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both
natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social
interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as
environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting
swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by
modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to
analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we
uncover a "detectability-durability trade-off", demonstrating a tension between
a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once
detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off,
explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward
task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural
network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation
by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting
trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial
configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can
guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of
natural swarm dynamics.

Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle
(LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based
therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of
machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular
structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead
identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data
quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor
generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection
Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection
efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse
set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for
transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with
chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints,
outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings,
such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a
combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest
performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE
($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN
consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus,
LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction
and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems
design.

TL;DR: SPATIA是一个多尺度生成和预测模型，用于空间转录组学，通过融合细胞形态和基因表达数据，学习统一的、空间感知的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解细胞形态、基因表达和空间组织如何共同影响组织功能是生物学中的核心挑战。现有方法通常孤立分析这些模态或分辨率有限。

Method: SPATIA通过交叉注意力融合图像衍生的形态标记和转录组向量标记，生成细胞级嵌入，并使用Transformer模块在生态位和组织水平上聚合这些嵌入以捕捉空间依赖性。

Result: SPATIA在12个任务中优于13个现有模型，并能生成反映转录组扰动的高分辨率细胞图像。

Conclusion: SPATIA为空间转录组学提供了一种统一的多尺度建模方法，显著提升了性能并实现了跨模态的高分辨率生成。

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSciML的性能依赖于测试函数的选择，现有方法（如多尺度全局正交测试函数）效率不足，需改进。

Method: 提出数据驱动方法构造单尺度局部参考函数，通过数值逼近积分误差确定最优支持大小。

Result: 实验表明，所选支持区域与参数估计误差最小区域一致，计算效率优于多尺度全局方法。

Conclusion: 单尺度局部参考函数方法在噪声鲁棒性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Weak form Scientific Machine Learning (WSciML) is a recently developed
framework for data-driven modeling and scientific discovery. It leverages the
weak form of equation error residuals to provide enhanced noise robustness in
system identification via convolving model equations with test functions,
reformulating the problem to avoid direct differentiation of data. The
performance, however, relies on wisely choosing a set of compactly supported
test functions.
  In this work, we mathematically motivate a novel data-driven method for
constructing Single-scale-Local reference functions for creating the set of
test functions. Our approach numerically approximates the integration error
introduced by the quadrature and identifies the support size for which the
error is minimal, without requiring access to the model parameter values.
Through numerical experiments across various models, noise levels, and temporal
resolutions, we demonstrate that the selected supports consistently align with
regions of minimal parameter estimation error. We also compare the proposed
method against the strategy for constructing Multi-scale-Global (and
orthogonal) test functions introduced in our prior work, demonstrating the
improved computational efficiency.

Result: 结果表明，模型能够成功重建复杂物理动态，包括2D Kármán涡街的CFD数据集。

Conclusion: 结论是紧凑潜在表示与时间动态学习的结合在模拟物理系统中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with
learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on
concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains
why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating
to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics
datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a
reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the
next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing
complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through
simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale
generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety
of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the
chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street
around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the

Conclusion: 该方法通过机器学习简化了多材料流动模拟，提高了计算效率和准确性，适用于复杂界面问题。

Abstract: We present a machine-learning based Volume Of Fluid method to simulate
multi-material flows on three-dimensional domains. One of the novelties of the
method is that the flux fraction is computed by evaluating a previously trained
neural network and without explicitly reconstructing any local interface
approximating the exact one. The network is trained on a purely synthetic
dataset generated by randomly sampling numerous local interfaces and which can
be adapted to improve the scheme on less regular interfaces when needed.
Several strategies to ensure the efficiency of the method and the satisfaction
of physical constraints and properties are suggested and formalized. Numerical
results on the advection equation are provided to show the performance of the
method. We observe numerical convergence as the size of the mesh tends to zero
$h=1/N_h\searrow 0$, with a better rate than two reference schemes.

Abstract: Fine, regular, and star triangulations (FRSTs) of four-dimensional reflexive
polytopes give rise to toric varieties, within which generic anticanonical
hypersurfaces yield smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds. We employ transformers --
deep learning models originally developed for language modeling -- to generate
FRSTs across a range of polytope sizes. Our models exhibit efficient and
unbiased sampling, and can self-improve through retraining on their own output.
These results lay the foundation for AICY: a community-driven platform that
combines self-improving machine learning models with a continuously expanding

Motivation: 评估DL模型在模拟训练范围外的极端气候事件（如热浪和寒潮）的能力。

Method: 比较混合神经全球环流模型（NGCM）和纯数据驱动的深度学习地球系统模型（DLESyM）与传统高分辨率模型（HiRAM）在1900-1960年间的表现。

Result: DL模型在大多数地区能成功模拟极端事件，但在北美和北亚表现较差；DLESyM因温度自相关性高估频率，而NGCM表现更接近HiRAM。

Conclusion: DL模型在模拟极端气候事件方面具有潜力，但需进一步优化以减少区域偏差和自相关性问题。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as
fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their
training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid
Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning
Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution
land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All
models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over
1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960).
Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly
reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events
during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions
of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during
1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends
to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL
hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于土地利用类型（LUT）的机器学习方法，用于快速预测城市热岛效应（UHI）中的地面和空气温度，并通过分类驱动因素提高了模型的解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热岛效应（UHIs）在热浪期间加剧，对公共健康构成威胁。为了缓解UHIs，需要理解不同土地利用类型（LUTs）和驱动因素对城市热的影响。

Method: 研究使用随机森林（RFs）和极端梯度提升（XGB）训练WRF-SLUCM模型输出数据，提出了一种基于LUT的分类模型（LB），将驱动因素分为驱动（D）、城市（U）和局部（L）特征。

Result: LB模型在预测温度时显著优于非LB模型，尤其是当训练数据中包含更多热浪数据时。关键的小尺度驱动因素包括表面发射率、反照率和叶面积指数（LAI）。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市规划者提供了一个直接框架，用于评估UHI缓解措施的可行性，尽管仍需减少统计不确定性并在其他城市测试。

Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and
pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first
estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and
drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to
small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify
these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features,
respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency,
a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator
for Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to a Single-Layer Urban
Canopy Model (WRF-SLUCM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature
(T2). Using random forests (RFs) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained
on WRF-SLUCM output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in
2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize
features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical
weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and
sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers -
most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models
employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than
models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in
training. With RF-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method
substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce
statistical uncertainties and testing the method on other cities, the proposed
approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI
mitigation assessment.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大脑中神经调节剂如何通过调节神经元增益和抑制门控来解决可塑性与稳定性之间的平衡问题，并提出了一个两室Izhikevich模型来模拟这一机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解神经调节剂（如乙酰胆碱和去甲肾上腺素）如何通过调节神经元增益和抑制门控来平衡神经回路的分隔与整合，从而解决可塑性与稳定性之间的冲突。

Method: 开发了一个两室Izhikevich模型，模拟了锥体神经元和两种中间神经元（SOM和PV）的连接，结合高斯连接性和突触可塑性（STDP），研究了树突驱动和抑制对神经元增益的影响。

Result: 研究发现，更强的树突驱动或更紧密的耦合会通过增加钙触发的体细胞爆发的可能性来提高增益，而树突靶向抑制会降低增益。体细胞靶向抑制则通过提高邻近神经元的放电阈值来门控输出。此外，爆发加速了STDP，支持快速的突触重构和灵活性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，神经调节剂驱动的短暂增益脉冲可能作为一种自适应双时间尺度优化机制，有效调节突触权重更新，从而平衡可塑性与稳定性。

Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the
plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as
acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain
and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed
by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal
system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant
substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals
coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a
single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts
the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that
translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this
mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons
and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,
linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,
while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by
shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive
or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of
calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition
suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold
of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting
accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and
flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators
could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively
modulating the synaptic weight updates.

Result: LILITH通过发育训练和进化优化，探索意识涌现的神经相关性与模块间信号模式。

Conclusion: LILITH为意识研究提供新框架，但实现仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward
networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that
expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be
a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We
propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of
modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication
protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models
distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory,
sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent
token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike
traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training
where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences,
developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental
interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct
empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information
Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module
signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness
emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into
different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates,
contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics.
The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the
substantial challenges in implementing such a system.

Motivation: 当前针对后门攻击的防御方法存在计算成本高或对高级攻击效果不佳的问题，需要一种更高效且有效的解决方案。

Result: 在4个数据集和11种攻击类型上的实验表明，CGD将攻击成功率降至1%以下，且干净数据精度仅下降0.3%。

Conclusion: CGD在效率、效果和实际应用性方面表现优异，适用于现实世界的后门防御场景。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model.
Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational
costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and
clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor
Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various
backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify
inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with
these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the
backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD
reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean
accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing
defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted
to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining
low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is
compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional
efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/binyxu/CGD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湍流优化在工程中有广泛应用，但现有方法因混沌性导致梯度发散，无法扩展到实际规模的网格点。

Method: OGF方法通过在线估计梯度和参数更新，结合有限差分估计器，避免梯度发散。

Result: OGF方法在多个混沌系统中成功优化，损失降低多个数量级，并准确恢复最优参数。

Conclusion: OGF方法为湍流优化提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution
converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest
typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t}
\int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow
\infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the
Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x;
\theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization,
flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as
existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically
representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the
chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method
diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large
degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state
statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method
forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while
simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key
feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster
optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to
avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is
demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial
differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky
equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous
isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the
loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately
recovers the optimal parameters.

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的替代求解器（NSS），用于在资源受限的边缘硬件上高效推断电力电子系统的混合连续-离散动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时边缘侧推断电力电子系统的动态特性对测试、控制和监测具有变革性潜力，但传统方法在资源受限的边缘硬件上效率低下。

Method: NSS利用轻量级神经网络替代传统求解器中耗时的矩阵运算和高阶数值积分步骤，将顺序瓶颈转化为适合边缘硬件的并行操作。

Result: 实验验证表明，NSS在多级DC-DC转换器上实现了23倍的速度提升和60%的硬件资源减少。

Conclusion: NSS为高保真电力电子系统动态的边缘推断部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the
real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and
monitoring. How-ever, efficiently inferring the inherent hybrid
continu-ous-discrete dynamics on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a
significant challenge. This letter pro-poses a neural substitute solver (NSS)
approach, which is a neural-network-based framework aimed at rapid accurate
inference with significantly reduced computational costs. Specifically, NSS
leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming matrix
operation and high-order numerical integration steps in traditional solvers,
which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable
for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter
demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction
compared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of
high-fidelity PES dynamics.

Main category: cs.DB

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需手动调优，学习型方法泛化能力有限，LLM的成功启发了将其融入查询优化以提升泛化性。

Method: 结合轻量模型生成软提示、商用LLM重写查询、显式匹配提示对齐模型，降低推理延迟和微调成本。

Result: LLM4Hint在效果和泛化性上优于现有学习型优化器。

Conclusion: LLM4Hint通过LLM理解查询的能力，显著提升了查询优化的效果和泛化性。

Abstract: Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS,
and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances
in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome
hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face
limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large
Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how
LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.
Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly
including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost
and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token
sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical
features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to
alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint}
that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization
hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model
to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the
SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously
reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting
strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the
backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit
matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight
model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show
that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the
query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in
terms of both effectiveness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模部署LLM在数据处理中存在高昂的计算和内存成本，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: IOLM-DB利用查询特定的模型优化，通过量化、稀疏化和结构剪枝等技术生成轻量级专用模型。

Result: 模型体积减少76%，吞吐量提升3.31倍，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: IOLM-DB证明了在分析系统中高效使用LLM查询的可行性，为未来OLAP应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance analytics systems with powerful data
summarization, cleaning, and semantic transformation capabilities. However,
deploying LLMs at scale -- processing millions to billions of rows -- remains
prohibitively expensive in computation and memory. We present IOLM-DB, a novel
system that makes LLM-enhanced database queries practical through
query-specific model optimization. Instead of using general-purpose LLMs,
IOLM-DB generates lightweight, specialized models tailored to each query's
specific needs using representative data samples. IOLM-DB reduces model
footprints by up to 76% and increases throughput by up to 3.31$\times$ while
maintaining accuracy through aggressive compression techniques, including
quantization, sparsification, and structural pruning. We further show how our
approach enables higher parallelism on existing hardware and seamlessly
supports caching and batching strategies to reduce overheads. Our prototype
demonstrates that leveraging LLM queries inside analytics systems is feasible
at scale, opening new possibilities for future OLAP applications.

Motivation: 解决中世纪法律文件转录的高难度问题，通过自动化减少人工劳动，提高转录质量和效率。

Method: 1. 使用HTR模型生成基线转录；2. 结合图像和LLM进行多模态校正；3. 用LLM扩展缩写文本为完整拉丁文；4. 通过LLM进行命名实体校正。

Result: 在详细案例研究中，单词错误率（WER）降至2-7%，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该混合多阶段方法有效自动化了转录中最繁琐的部分，生成了高质量、可分析的输出，适用于当前技术环境。

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

### [596] [Biaxialformer: Leveraging Channel Independence and Inter-Channel Correlations in EEG Signal Decoding for Predicting Neurological Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02879)
*Naimahmed Nesaragi,Hemin Ali Qadir,Per Steiner Halvorsen,Ilangko Balasingham*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Biaxialformer是一种基于Transformer的双阶段注意力框架模型，旨在同时捕捉EEG信号的时空信息，解决了传统通道独立模型中忽略通道间相关性的问题，显著提升了神经预后预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的通道独立模型在EEG信号分析中忽略了通道间的相关性，导致信息丢失和预测准确性下降，特别是在复杂的神经预后预测任务中。

Method: 提出Biaxialformer模型，通过双阶段注意力框架独立捕捉时空信息，结合联合学习的位置编码和可变感受野的标记化模块，同时利用双极EEG信号增强空间特征提取。

Result: 在跨医院的多中心I-CARE数据上验证，Biaxialformer的平均AUC为0.7688，AUPRC为0.8643，F1为0.6518，表现出优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Biaxialformer通过有效整合时空信息，显著提升了EEG信号分析的性能，为神经预后预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of EEG signals requires comprehensive modeling of both
temporal dynamics within individual channels and spatial dependencies across
channels. While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)
strategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,
they often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in
multivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and
reduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological
outcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,
characterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.
This model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and
channel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual
reinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint
learning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and
spatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation
forgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a
tokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of
fine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance
spatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture
inter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in
EEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by
addressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose
patients. Using the multicenter I-CARE data from five hospitals, we validate
the robustness and generalizability of Biaxialformer with an average AUC
0.7688, AUPRC 0.8643, and F1 0.6518 in a cross-hospital scenario.

*Dieter Coppens,Adnan Shahid,Eli De Poorter*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的TDoA定位校正方法，利用所有可用锚节点的原始信道脉冲响应（CIR）计算位置校正，显著提高了在复杂工业环境中的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWB定位系统在工业环境中因多径效应和非视距（NLOS）条件导致精度下降，现有方法通常排除NLOS链路，但会引发几何精度稀释问题，且在多数链路为NLOS时不可行。

Method: 采用Transformer模型处理原始CIR数据，引入不同的CIR排序、分块和位置编码策略，分析各技术的可扩展性和性能提升。

Result: 在真实UWB测量实验中，该方法在几乎全为NLOS信号的复杂环境中实现了0.39米的定位精度，比TDoA基线提高了73.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了工业环境中UWB定位的NLOS问题，显著提升了定位精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, UWB-based localization systems suffer
inaccuracies when deployed in industrial locations with many obstacles due to
multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In such
environments, current error mitigation approaches for time difference of
arrival (TDoA) localization typically exclude NLOS links. However, this
exclusion approach leads to geometric dilution of precision problems and this
approach is infeasible when the majority of links are NLOS. To address these
limitations, we propose a transformer-based TDoA position correction method
that uses raw channel impulse responses (CIRs) from all available anchor nodes
to compute position corrections. We introduce different CIR ordering, patching
and positional encoding strategies for the transformer, and analyze each
proposed technique's scalability and performance gains. Based on experiments on
real-world UWB measurements, our approach can provide accuracies of up to 0.39
m in a complex environment consisting of (almost) only NLOS signals, which is
an improvement of 73.6 % compared to the TDoA baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM-MAS在协作问题解决中表现出色，但其通信和协调中的安全风险尚未充分研究。

Method: 系统研究意图隐藏威胁，设计四种攻击范式，并提出基于心理学（HEXACO人格模型和Reid技术）的检测框架AgentXposed。

Result: 实验表明攻击具有强破坏性，而AgentXposed能有效检测恶意行为，但意图隐藏攻击的检测率略低于基线方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了意图隐藏攻击的结构和行为风险，为LLM-MAS安全提供了心理学视角的见解。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit
strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and
coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically
investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four
representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while
maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized,
decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on
six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic,
and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities.
To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework
AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid
Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based
monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our
detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors.
The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that
of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal
the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer
valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through
psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of
multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 研究集体行为中的领导力动态，解决传统方法在噪声或短数据集中的局限性。

Method: 利用速度、加速度和方向等多变量时间滞后相关性构建动态网络，识别领导力模式。

Result: 在模拟实验中，网络方法在有限时空观测下优于传统方法，更一致地识别真实领导者。

Conclusion: 动态网络方法为领导力推断提供了更高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge
in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional
information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and
Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer
leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or
short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability
estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference
using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,
acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs
over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need
for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate
our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek
model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and
independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the
network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited
spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence
metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

Motivation: 自然灾害频发，机场在救援中成为瓶颈，信息不对称和资源不足是主要问题，需研究其对操作性能的影响。

Method: 创建基于代理的模型，模拟不同信息不确定性下的货物处理策略，并进行专家校准和验证。

Result: 单个未计划飞机影响可忽略，但更多未计划飞机会显著增加等待时间。

Conclusion: 信息不对称和资源不足对机场救援操作性能有显著影响，需优化资源分配策略。

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many
people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important
hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the
airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden
need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational
side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,
first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,
and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand
the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource
allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an
airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing
realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information
uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in
the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,
which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting
times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are
negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned
aircraft.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent
systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability,
robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world
tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable,
or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing
next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire,
an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI
teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated
wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial
observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The
environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language
interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and
evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks,
uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges
in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon
planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable
architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a

Conclusion: 该方法为非晶材料的设计和模拟提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and
inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex
structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that
reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than
conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data
sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order,
sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by
simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation
allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to
uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures.
Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and
properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how
synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods
provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials
previously inaccessible to computational methods.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了PRNGs统计鲁棒性的现有认知，并揭示了框架实现可能引入的潜在问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) frameworks rely heavily on pseudorandom number
generators (PRNGs) for tasks such as data shuffling, weight initialization,
dropout, and optimization. Yet, the statistical quality and reproducibility of
these generators-particularly when integrated into frameworks like PyTorch,
TensorFlow, and NumPy-are underexplored. In this paper, we compare the
statistical quality of PRNGs used in ML frameworks (Mersenne Twister, PCG, and
Philox) against their original C implementations. Using the rigorous TestU01
BigCrush test suite, we evaluate 896 independent random streams for each
generator. Our findings challenge claims of statistical robustness, revealing
that even generators labeled ''crush-resistant'' (e.g., PCG, Philox) may fail
certain statistical tests. Surprisingly, we can observe some differences in
failure profiles between the native and framework-integrated versions of the
same algorithm, highlighting some implementation differences that may exist.

### [604] [Kalman Filter Aided Federated Koopman Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04808)
*Yutao Chen,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出KF-FedKL方法，结合卡尔曼滤波与联邦学习，解决非线性系统线性化中数据不足和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Koopman学习依赖精确系统状态和高质量数据，实际应用中难以满足。本文针对仅有观测数据且数据不足的情况。

Method: 提出KF-FedKL，结合无迹卡尔曼滤波、联邦学习与Koopman分析，通过改进的FedAvg算法实现协作。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了KF-FedKL在各种情况下的性能。

Conclusion: KF-FedKL在数据不足和隐私保护下有效实现非线性系统线性化。

Abstract: Real-time control and estimation are pivotal for applications such as
industrial automation and future healthcare. The realization of this vision
relies heavily on efficient interactions with nonlinear systems. Therefore,
Koopman learning, which leverages the power of deep learning to linearize
nonlinear systems, has been one of the most successful examples of mitigating
the complexity inherent in nonlinearity. However, the existing literature
assumes access to accurate system states and abundant high-quality data for
Koopman analysis, which is usually impractical in real-world scenarios. To fill
this void, this paper considers the case where only observations of the system
are available and where the observation data is insufficient to accomplish an
independent Koopman analysis. To this end, we propose Kalman Filter aided
Federated Koopman Learning (KF-FedKL), which pioneers the combination of Kalman
filtering and federated learning with Koopman analysis. By doing so, we can
achieve collaborative linearization with privacy guarantees. Specifically, we
employ a straightforward yet efficient loss function to drive the training of a
deep Koopman network for linearization. To obtain system information devoid of
individual information from observation data, we leverage the unscented Kalman
filter and the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. To achieve collaboration
between clients, we adopt the federated learning framework and develop a
modified FedAvg algorithm to orchestrate the collaboration. A convergence
analysis of the proposed framework is also presented. Finally, through
extensive numerical simulations, we showcase the performance of KF-FedKL under
various situations.

*Jiajia Guo,Peiwen Jiang,Chao-Kai Wen,Shi Jin,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: LVM4CSI是一个通用高效的框架，利用CSI与计算机视觉数据的结构相似性，直接应用预训练的大型视觉模型于无线任务，无需微调，性能优于任务特定神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI方法依赖任务特定神经网络、需要大量训练数据和专家设计的问题，提高CSI获取和利用的通用性和实用性。

Method: 将CSI任务映射到类似计算机视觉任务，将复数CSI转换为视觉格式，集成轻量可训练层以适应通信目标。

Result: 在信道估计、人类活动识别和用户定位等任务中，性能优于任务特定神经网络，如信道估计提升9.61 dB，定位误差减少40%。

Conclusion: LVM4CSI显著减少可训练参数，无需任务特定神经网络设计，为无线通信提供了一种高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of
wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and
complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial
intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and
utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks
(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting
their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we
propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the
structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly
apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to
wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language
model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI
tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats
compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt
extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI
through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human
activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI
achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an
improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%
reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN
design.

Method: 通过评估MLLMs对网球动作的分类和序列识别能力，并尝试结合不同训练方法和传统模型以提升性能。

Result: MLLMs在网球视频分析中展现出潜力，尤其在动作分类和序列识别方面，但性能仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: MLLMs在体育视频分析中具有应用前景，未来可通过优化训练方法和模型结合进一步提升其表现。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Method: 提出OBSER框架，结合度量学习和自监督学习，引入统计可分离性函数验证。

Result: 在开放世界和真实环境中表现优异，优于基于场景的方法。

Conclusion: OBSER框架为零样本环境识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏瓦片的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏内容与叙事对齐的挑战，以及训练数据分布不平衡导致的视觉多样性受限问题。

Method: 收集OpenGameArt.org上艺术家创作的游戏瓦片，提供语义标注，并开发低分辨率瓦片的目标检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的游戏内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的目标检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法、支持叙事丰富游戏内容的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的无训练框架，通过迭代调整时间关注点，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间关注点来解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两阶段迭代：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间采样固定数量帧，生成细化响应和置信度。TS-BFS进一步优化效率，采用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间关注点，显著提升了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，同时降低了内存消耗。

Conclusion: TS为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于鸟瞰图（BEV）的运动模拟方法，用于合成高风险运动数据（DriveMRP-10K），并设计了一个与VLM无关的运动风险估计框架（DriveMRP-Agent），显著提升了自动驾驶中运动风险预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶在长尾场景中预测未来运动的安全性仍存在挑战，主要由于动态环境的不确定性和数据覆盖的局限性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据和创新框架，显著提升了自动驾驶中运动风险预测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过概率视角生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念的同时误导分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击局限于单图像扰动，缺乏多样性和概念保持能力，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 采用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗样本，确保概念一致性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能生成更多样化的对抗样本，高效保持概念，同时提高攻击效率。

Conclusion: 概念对抗攻击框架在多样性和概念保持上优于传统方法，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection
in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial

comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating
target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

TL;DR: GRF（Gated Recurrent Fusion）是一种线性可扩展的多模态融合架构，通过递归管道实现高效的多模态学习，解决了传统跨注意力模型计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中深度细粒度融合与计算可扩展性之间存在矛盾，传统跨注意力模型虽性能强但计算复杂度高，难以适用于多模态场景。

Method: GRF采用递归设计，通过Transformer Decoder层进行对称跨注意力融合，并结合Gated Fusion Unit动态控制信息流，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中，GRF性能与复杂基线相当，且能生成结构化、类别可分化的表示。

Conclusion: GRF为高效、可扩展的多模态表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种心理学分类法，用于分析视觉语言模型（VLMs）的幻觉行为，包括迎合性、逻辑不一致性和新发现的权威偏见，并通过AIpsych基准测试揭示了模型行为与心理学偏见的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要从技术或外部驱动因素解释VLMs的幻觉行为，忽略了其可能与人类心理学认知偏见的相似性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计AIpsych基准测试，系统分析VLMs在不同模型架构和参数规模下的行为，尤其是对操纵问题的响应模式。

Result: 实验表明，随着模型规模增大，VLMs的迎合性增强但权威偏见减少，暗示能力提升但可能损害回答的完整性。人类研究进一步验证了这些发现。

Conclusion: 本文为理解VLMs幻觉行为提供了新视角，强调将心理学原则融入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

TL;DR: Causal-SAM-LLM框架通过语言对抗解耦和测试时因果干预，提升了医学图像分割模型的泛化能力，显著提高了OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学图像分割中因学习虚假相关性而无法泛化到未见域的问题。

Method: 结合冻结的SAM编码器，采用语言对抗解耦（LAD）和测试时因果干预（TCI）技术。

Result: 在跨扫描器、跨模态和跨解剖学设置下，平均Dice分数提升6.2点，Hausdorff距离减少15.8毫米。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成的图像越来越逼真，区分真实与生成图像变得困难，亟需开发通用性强的检测器。

Conclusion: LATTE证明了潜在嵌入轨迹在生成图像检测中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 墓碑作为历史和文化的载体面临保存挑战，需要一种更高效的方法来数字化和解析其内容。

Method: 结合VLM和RAG技术，将墓碑图像转化为结构化的墓碑意义表示（TMR），并整合外部依赖元素。

Result: 解析准确率从传统OCR的F1分数36.1提升至89.5，且在多样文化和语言条件下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架首次利用大规模视觉语言模型形式化墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态嵌入模型（如VLM2Vec、E5-V、GME）主要针对自然图像，对其他视觉形式（如视频和视觉文档）支持有限，限制了其在AI代理、多模态搜索等实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了MMEB-V2基准，扩展了五种新任务类型，并训练了支持多种输入形式的VLM2Vec-V2模型。

Result: VLM2Vec-V2在新任务和原有图像任务上均表现优异，验证了其通用性和改进效果。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态嵌入模型的通用性和统一学习策略提供了见解，为研究和实际应用中的表示学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

Result: 方法在多个数据集上生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述，并通过标准评估和人工验证。

Conclusion: 提出的可解释神经分析方法有效解决了长段落视频描述的生成问题。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部验证或事后修正，缺乏训练时直接验证输出的内部机制。

Method: ReLoop采用环形结构，整合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，实现多模态一致性。

Result: ReLoop显著降低了多个基准测试中的幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

Motivation: 多编码器设计旨在增强视觉理解能力，但实际性能提升有限甚至下降，需系统研究冗余问题。

Method: 通过消融实验分析多编码器MLLMs，提出Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR)和Information Gap (IG)量化编码器贡献。

Result: 实验证实部分视觉编码器贡献极小或负向影响性能，冗余现象普遍存在。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计效率低下，提出的CUR和IG可作为诊断工具优化多模态架构。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

*Jianjiang Yang,Ziyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知启发的方法，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的幻觉问题重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并提出了一个三轴空间（Hallucination Tri-Space）和动态向量表示（ARC）来量化对齐张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成内容与提示语义不一致。作者认为这些失败反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性错位。

Method: 作者提出了Hallucination Tri-Space（语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础）和Alignment Risk Code（ARC），并开发了TensionModulator（TM-ARC）控制器，通过实时监测ARC信号并在采样过程中进行干预来减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC显著减少了幻觉，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解基于扩散的T2I系统中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Conclusion: 通过'对齐可回答性'框架，Video-LLMs能够更准确地评估问题相关性，提升实际应用中的表现。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Result: 在Pascal VOC和Context数据集上，SemiOVS比现有方法提升3.0-3.5 mIoU，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SemiOVS能有效利用OOD未标记图像，为未来研究和实际应用提供启发。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Method: 通过微调的稳定扩散模型（使用LoRA权重）生成合成图像，并结合少量真实样本训练分类器。

Result: 合成图像显著提升了分类器性能：ResNet分类器准确率从27.3%提升至78.4%，CLIP分类器从61.8%提升至76.8%。

Conclusion: 合成图像是生物医学研究中克服数据限制、提升模型泛化能力的有效工具，有助于医学诊断和研究。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复方面取得重要进展，对文化遗产保护有重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated

visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

### [633] [Source-Free Domain Adaptation via Multi-view Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03321)
*Amirfarhad Farhadi,Naser Mozayani,Azadeh Zamanifar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决源自由无监督域适应（SFUDA）中低质量原型样本和伪标签错误分配问题的方法，通过可靠样本记忆模块、多视角对比学习和噪声标签过滤技术，显著提升了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题限制了对敏感数据的访问，SFUDA成为解决域适应问题的有效方法，但仍面临原型样本质量低和伪标签分配不准确的挑战。

Method: 方法分为三阶段：1) 可靠样本记忆模块（RSM）提升原型样本质量；2) 多视角对比学习（MVCL）改进伪标签；3) 噪声标签过滤技术进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种先进方法平均提升了2%和6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键挑战，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻深度神经网络对大规模数据集的依赖，同时关注任务特定信息以提升下游任务表现。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，并可能提升其他下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 任务特定的采样策略在数据集蒸馏中表现优越，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究如何将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到多模态大语言模型中，以解锁高级视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段范式：1）大规模语言冷启动微调；2）多模态强化学习（近1000步）。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 模型Open-Vision-Reasoner在多个基准测试中表现优异，如MATH500（95.3%）、MathVision（51.8%）和MathVerse（54.6%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更强大、行为对齐的多模态推理模型提供了关键见解和资源。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SafeVision的方法，通过识别风格差异来检测面部替换的深度伪造内容，无需访问真实面部图像，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部替换深度伪造在现实世界中广泛传播虚假信息、损害声誉、操纵政治观点等，现有检测方法依赖面部标志或像素特征，难以应对无缝混合的面部替换。此外，数据集创建涉及隐私问题。

Method: 利用风格差异识别面部替换图像，避免直接处理真实面部数据。通过多数据集和多种面部替换方法进行全面评估。

Result: SafeVision在多样化场景中有效检测面部替换深度伪造，提供可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: SafeVision是首个利用风格特征并具有隐私保护的深度伪造检测方法，适用于现实世界中的挑战性应用。

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DESign框架通过动态上下文感知卷积（DCAC）和子网正则化CTC（SR-CTC）提升连续手语识别（CSLR）性能，解决了现有方法在时空建模和过拟合方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，动态卷积主要关注空间建模，忽略了时间动态和上下文依赖。

Method: 提出DESign框架，结合DCAC动态捕捉帧间运动线索和SR-CTC通过子网监督防止过拟合。

Result: 在主流数据集（PHOENIX14等）上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升了CSLR的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了遥感变化检测中基础设计选择的重要性，指出优化核心组件比增加复杂架构更能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注复杂架构的添加，而忽视了基础设计选择（如主干网络选择、预训练策略和训练配置）的性能贡献。

Method: 系统性地重新审视变化检测模型的设计空间，分析优化基线的潜力，并识别出一组对现有和新架构都有益的基础设计选择。

Result: 通过精心设计，即使是简单的模型也能在六个挑战性数据集上达到或超越最新方法的性能。

Conclusion: 优化核心组件与架构创新同样重要，为未来方法提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Motivation: 现有两阶段流程（掩码生成+扩散编辑）过于关注生成器优化而忽视掩码可控性，导致用户定义灵活性差和姿态鲁棒性弱的问题。

Method: 提出Pose-Star框架，通过骨骼关键点校准扩散注意力（Star tokens），结合相位感知分析和阈值掩码等技术增强掩码生成。

Result: Pose-Star能够动态生成解剖感知掩码，提升复杂姿态下的编辑效果，满足开放世界的需求。

Conclusion: Pose-Star为工业级时尚图像编辑提供了基础，实现了解剖感知和姿态鲁棒的编辑。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过随机多裁剪增强激活CLIP局部特征分析能力的方法，以解决其偏向全局图像模式的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽略了细粒度局部语义，而现有方法假设VLMs能识别局部细节，但实验表明CLIP对全局模式的强偏见限制了其处理局部描述符的能力。

Method: 采用随机多裁剪增强，通过裁剪部分区域约束模型的感受野并重新校准其注意力机制，从而激活CLIP的局部特征分析能力。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效且即插即用，成功解决了CLIP的局部语义处理问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically

advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player

estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex

integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical

Motivation: 细粒度视频分类需要理解复杂的时空和语义信息，单一模态难以胜任。

Method: 使用GRU序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制融合多模态表示，结合分类或回归损失训练，并通过特征增强和自编码技术正则化。

Result: 在DVD和Aff-Wild2数据集上显著优于单模态基线，跨注意力和特征增强对鲁棒性和性能贡献显著。

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略有效提升细粒度视频分类性能，跨注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Conclusion: 结论指出ViFMs在科学应用中的潜力，并呼吁开发更具通用性的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

TL;DR: 利用街景图像建模食品不安全问题，提出特征提取和门控注意力聚合的两步方法，虽预测能力稍逊，但可作为现有方法的补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品不安全是全球城市面临的重大社会与公共卫生问题，现有依赖调查数据的方法难以扩展。

Method: 提出两步法：特征提取和门控注意力图像聚合，并与其他模型架构对比评估。

Result: 模型预测能力略逊，但权重解释和案例研究表明其潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法有望为城市规划者和政策制定者补充现有食品不安全识别方法。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，用于印度全国范围内的农场级多作物识别，解决了现有方法在地理可扩展性、作物类型覆盖和季节性识别等方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业大国的作物类型信息对国家粮食安全、政策制定和经济规划至关重要，但现有方法在可扩展性和季节性识别方面存在不足。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星影像与全国农场边界数据，利用深度学习模型识别12种主要作物，并开发了自动季节检测算法。

Result: 模型在冬季和季风季节的识别准确率分别为94%和75%，并能在生长季节早期（两个月内）提供可靠的作物识别。

Conclusion: 该框架具有高度可扩展性，为印度农业监测和管理提供了首个全国范围内的农场级季节性作物数据产品。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EEG-VJEPA是一种基于V-JEPA的自监督学习方法，用于EEG信号分类，通过联合嵌入和自适应掩码学习时空特征，在TUH数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据少、高维度和缺乏捕捉时空依赖的模型等问题，现有自监督方法仅关注空间或时间特征，导致表征不优。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，采用V-JEPA框架，通过联合嵌入和自适应掩码学习时空表征。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IMET的新框架，结合课程学习和核心集选择，旨在提升医学图像分类的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集常存在噪声、错误标签或难以泛化的图像，尤其是边缘案例和罕见结果，可能导致模型过拟合或误分类，影响诊断准确性。

Method: IMET框架通过迭代识别误分类样本，优化训练过程，重点关注边缘案例和罕见结果。

Result: 在基准医学图像分类数据集上，IMET表现优于现有ResNet架构，提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种高效且鲁棒的训练方法，尤其适用于数据有限且噪声较多的情况。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR上表现优于监督目标和未利用结构的基线方法。

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了一种轻量级、模态无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Motivation: 探索梯度基（HOG）和拓扑（TDA）特征提取方法在医学图像分类中的效果差异，填补视网膜图像领域的空白。

Method: 使用HOG和TDA分别提取特征，训练七种经典机器学习模型，通过10折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: XGBoost在二分类和多分类任务中表现最佳，HOG和TDA准确率相近（二分类约94%，多分类约74%）。

Conclusion: HOG和TDA均表现优异但捕捉不同特征，适用于医学图像分析并可整合到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Motivation: 解决手语翻译中数据稀缺问题，提升自动手语识别的准确性和灵活性。

Method: 提取全局时空和手形特征，通过动态时间规整和余弦相似度匹配字典，利用LLM进行上下文消歧。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现出更高的准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: LLMs在手语识别中具有潜力，新框架显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉输入的整合。作者发现MLLMs在适当引导下能自发重新关注视觉输入，表明其具备视觉融合推理的内在能力。

Method: 通过分析MLLM的注意力模式，提出Look-Back方法，指导模型在推理过程中自主决定何时、何地及如何重新关注视觉输入。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型的推理和感知能力，在多个多模态基准测试中得到验证。

Conclusion: Look-Back展示了MLLMs具备自发视觉融合推理能力，为多模态推理提供了一种高效且隐式的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: SimpAgent在多样化的Web和移动环境中展现出高效性和潜力。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Conclusion: StreamDiT在实时视频生成任务中表现优异，适用于流式生成、交互生成等应用。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要大量计算资源，难以在私有数据或新模态上复现。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（先学习低频信息）和高斯噪声补丁增强。

Result: 在ViT-B/16上，预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双赢，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有去雾方法主要关注短距离场景，长距离去雾因信号损失严重而未被充分研究。近红外模态具有更好的雾穿透能力，但现有方法忽略了可见光图像中的雾残留问题。

Method: 提出HSVF框架，包含语义流和视觉流。语义流通过模态不变的内在表示重建无雾场景，视觉流从近红外模态恢复结构细节。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在长距离去雾任务中优于现有方法，能恢复高对比度场景和丰富纹理细节。

Conclusion: HSVF通过双流协作，有效解决了长距离去雾问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and

TL;DR: 论文探索了可解释提升机（EBM）结合特征工程在大气科学中的应用，特别是用于卫星图像中的超顶（OTs）检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在高风险应用中具有优势，但在大气科学中尚未广泛应用，目标是开发可解释的、基于物理的机器学习算法。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），并应用EBM进行分类任务，利用卫星图像数据和标签训练模型。

Result: 最终模型虽未达到复杂方法的精度，但表现良好，为开发可解释的机器学习算法迈出重要一步。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程为气象应用提供了可解释的机器学习解决方案，展示了人机协作的潜力。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Motivation: 医学影像算法开发因缺乏大规模标注数据而受限，合成数据可能解决这一问题。

Method: 通过物理模拟生成带有像素级标注的合成图像，应用于乳腺影像分析，并发布T-SYNTH数据集。

Result: T-SYNTH图像在增强真实数据集用于检测任务中显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 合成数据是解决医学影像数据不足的有效方法，T-SYNTH数据集为研究提供了资源。

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical
imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable
annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological
constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of
physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation
annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply
this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for
detection tasks in DM and DBT. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，用于改进自监督对比学习在人类活动识别中的泛化能力，通过抑制主体特异性特征来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中具有吸引力。然而，主体间的域偏移导致模型难以泛化到新主体。

Method: 引入Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一主体的负样本对，抑制主体特异性特征，强调活动特异性信息。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试（UTD-MHAD、MMAct、DARai）上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，能够显著提升HAR模型的泛化能力，并适用于多种自监督和监督学习场景。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文提出ConceptMix++框架，通过迭代优化提示词来分离提示词表达与图像生成能力，提升文本到图像模型的评估公平性和生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）基准测试因使用固定提示词可能低估模型真实生成能力，并引入偏见。

Method: 基于ConceptMix，采用多模态优化流程，利用视觉语言模型反馈系统优化提示词。

Result: 优化后的提示词显著提升生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，并发现某些视觉概念（如空间关系和形状）优化效果更显著。

Conclusion: 固定基准测试可能低估模型能力，而ConceptMix++提供了更准确的评估方法。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测不同时刻时未区分短长期，导致短长期预测学习不平衡，且未能充分利用先验信息。

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上验证了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能轻松集成到不同HMP模型中，适用于多种数据集和应用。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动作过渡和特征学习问题，提升了预测的合理性和一致性。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的传感器易受遮挡或视野限制影响，路边基础设施感知系统可提供互补信息，但传统3D目标检测算法难以适应俯视角度的域偏移。

Method: 采用2.5D目标检测框架，检测车辆地面投影的平行四边形，保留平面位置、大小和方向，忽略高度。训练数据结合真实场景和合成生成场景。

Result: 模型在未见过的摄像头视角和恶劣天气条件下表现优异，检测精度高，泛化能力强，对光照和天气条件具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了高效的路边感知解决方案，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative
Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles
(AVs) that simultaneously achieves low-latency and high-accuracy 3D object
detection. Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware
MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively
fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths
of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal
representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a
end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline
methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes
dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object
detection tasks for AVs.

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an
accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces
Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to
estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver
monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures
synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture
through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving
Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver
readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing
approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion.
As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to
the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with
new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the

influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端设计和创新架构，有效利用视频基础模型的视觉知识，直接生成高质量的UV纹理贴图。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Conclusion: M3-Med为未来研究提供了新方向，强调需要提升AI在复杂跨模态推理中的能力。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务算术框架的方法，将自解释模型的视觉可解释性从源域转移到目标域，提高了目标域的解释质量且不影响分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自解释模型训练中高昂的标注和计算成本问题，通过迁移学习实现高效的可解释性转移。

Method: 扩展基于视觉语言预训练模型的图像分类器，定义可解释性向量，并通过任务算术框架将其应用于目标域模型。

Result: 实验表明，除部分不相关域外，可解释性成功转移，且解释质量接近Kernel SHAP（仅需单次推理）。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种数据集上验证了可解释性向量的通用性和鲁棒性，显著提升了目标域的解释效率。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

TL;DR: GSTDS算法通过动态调整训练数据子集，利用预训练模型和谱分析优化数据选择，显著减少计算需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的数据筛选对神经网络训练至关重要，但现有方法可能效率不足或资源消耗大。

Method: GSTDS基于预训练模型和Fiedler向量评分机制，动态过滤冗余数据点，优化训练批次。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低4倍，性能优于JEST等现有方法。

Conclusion: GSTDS展示了谱分析在高效深度学习中的潜力，为自适应数据筛选提供了新方向。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

TL;DR: LEAwareSGD是一种基于Lyapunov Exponent（LE）的优化方法，通过动态调整学习率，使模型在混沌边缘训练，提升单域泛化（SDG）任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）任务面临域偏移大和数据多样性不足的挑战，现有方法主要依赖数据增强，难以适应大域偏移。

Method: 提出LEAwareSGD，利用LE测量调节学习率，使模型在混沌边缘训练，平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上的实验显示，LEAwareSGD显著提升泛化能力，PACS低数据场景下提升9.47%。

Conclusion: 混沌边缘训练能有效增强SDG任务的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过结合视觉语言模型和多模态数据，实现了跨场景的高精度相机重定位，为AR、MR等应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

Motivation: 现有模型在描述性动作生成或孤立的手势合成方面表现良好，但缺乏将动作与环境基础结合的综合性方法，限制了具身交互代理的发展。

Method: 论文引入了一个多模态数据集和框架，结合了合成数据集和VR对话数据集，提供了同步的动作、语音和3D场景信息，并连接了基于物理的模拟器。

Conclusion: 该研究为情境手势生成和基础多模态交互提供了新的研究基础，推动了具身交互代理的发展。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HiLa的分层视觉-语言协作框架，用于改进基于全切片图像的癌症生存预测，通过多级视觉特征和语言提示的对齐，以及跨层次传播和互对比学习模块，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的切片级标签，难以从千兆像素图像中学习判别性表示；视觉语言模型虽具潜力，但当前方法在语言提示和视觉特征对齐上表现不足，且忽略了图像层次结构。

Method: HiLa框架利用预训练特征提取器生成分层视觉特征，通过最优提示学习（OPL）对齐多属性语言提示，并引入跨层次传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块优化层次间协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉-语言协作和层次间交互优化，显著提升了生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有立体匹配网络在跨域性能上表现不佳，VFMs的潜力未被充分利用。

Method: 结合LoRA和MoE模块，动态选择专家并优化特征提取，同时引入轻量级决策网络以平衡效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的跨域和联合泛化性能。

Conclusion: SMoEStereo通过高效融合VFMs，显著提升了立体匹配的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常忽视局部时间依赖和高阶运动状态属性，导致轨迹预测性能受限。

Method: 提出局部趋势感知注意力机制捕捉局部时间依赖，运动状态编码器建模高阶运动状态，轻量级提案细化模块优化预测。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%，模型尺寸减少68%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer在减少模型复杂度的同时显著提升轨迹预测精度。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

TL;DR: 论文提出AVATAR基准和TAVLO模型，解决现有音频-视觉定位（AVL）研究中缺乏时间动态信息的问题，并在多场景下验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVL研究局限于图像级关联，忽略时间动态，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准（含四种场景）和TAVLO模型，通过高分辨率时间建模实现精确对齐。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射而表现不佳，TAVLO则显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 时间动态对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心化AVL设定了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Motivation: 手动标注CBCT上的解剖标志点耗时且存在观察者间差异，而传统深度学习方法因数据稀缺和标注成本高难以应用。

Method: GeoSapiens结合了Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，以捕捉解剖结构的几何关系。

Result: 在严格0.5 mm阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙齿标志点检测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Tempo-R0的视频多模态大语言模型，通过多模态时间感知强化来解决时间视频定位任务，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间视频定位（TVG）任务因视频信息量大且冗余而极具挑战性，需要模型全面理解视频以准确检索查询相关片段。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳模态对齐（ETA）预处理方法，并在微调阶段应用部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）增强时间推理能力。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试基准上，该方法比现有最优方法提升了约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过创新的预处理和微调策略，显著提升了时间视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，本文旨在揭示这一漏洞。

Method: 通过向数据集中注入毒化样本（将微妙的触发输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW内容。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，攻击成功率高且触发输入难以察觉。

Conclusion: 开源ControlNets管道存在严重漏洞，需加强数据净化和防御机制。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Result: MCFormer显著优于现有方法，达到最低的归一化端点误差（NEPE）。

Conclusion: 研究为PIV领域提供了基准资源和先进方法，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Conclusion: 研究旨在弥合法律与技术社区的鸿沟，提升对AI艺术版权社会问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

*Jinyang Guo,Weichen Zhang,Wanli Ouyang,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进式通道剪枝（PCP）的框架，通过迭代剪枝少量通道来加速卷积神经网络（CNN），优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致精度下降较大。PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少精度损失。

Method: PCP采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝），每次迭代剪枝少量通道，并使用贪心策略选择剪枝层以减少精度损失。

Result: 在监督学习和迁移学习设置下，PCP在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP是一种高效且通用的通道剪枝框架，适用于CNN和迁移学习任务。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

TL;DR: UDF-GMA是一种基于姿态的自动化GMA方法，通过显式建模模型参数和数据噪声的不确定性，提高了临床可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主流姿态自动化GMA方法因数据质量低和姿态估计噪声导致的不确定性问题，提升临床可靠性。

Method: UDF-GMA通过直接建模数据噪声的不确定性和贝叶斯近似估计模型参数的不确定性，并将这些不确定性与运动表示融合。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效预测poor repertoire，并具有较好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过显式建模不确定性，显著提升了姿态自动化GMA的可靠性和应用潜力。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频基准主要集中在视频生成质量和动作识别上，缺乏对感知和认知能力的全面评估，且评估指标过于简单。

Method: 提出了HV-MMBench基准，包含15个任务、多种数据格式（如选择题、填空题等）、50种视觉场景和不同时长的视频（10秒至30分钟）。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench为MLLM在人类中心视频理解领域的评估提供了更全面的工具，填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Motivation: 解决现有掩码自回归模型因分词器限制在质量和效率上落后于扩散模型的问题。

Method: 引入DC-HT深度压缩混合分词器，扩展MaskGIT框架，结合离散令牌和残差令牌进行图像生成。

Result: 在MJHQ-30K上gFID为5.49，GenEval得分为0.69，吞吐量提高1.5-7.9倍，延迟降低2.0-3.5倍。

Conclusion: DC-AR在图像生成质量和效率上均优于现有方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click框架通过交互式设计和对象级特征提取，显著提升了视频到音频生成的精确性和性能。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Motivation: AI生成内容（如GANs和扩散模型）的普及模糊了真实与合成图像的界限，现有检测方法缺乏透明度和解释性。

Method: VERITAS结合伪影定位和语义推理，不仅检测小尺寸图像是否为AI生成，还提供分类依据的解释。

Result: VERITAS在零样本合成图像检测任务中表现出色，并提供清晰的解释。

Conclusion: VERITAS为AI生成图像检测提供了透明且可解释的解决方案，有助于提升内容真实性。

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Motivation: CVS识别在腹腔镜胆囊切除术中至关重要，但现有方法依赖高成本的视觉标注，且多模态模型在多标签任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出CVS-AdaptNet，通过正负提示对齐图像嵌入与文本描述，增强多标签分类性能。

Conclusion: 文本增强的多模态框架提升了CVS识别性能，展示了通用模型在专业手术任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为外科计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了一种新颖且可推广的解决方案，显著减轻了临床医生的标注负担。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and

Conclusion: INTER无需额外数据即可显著减少LVLM的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ST-LLM的模型，旨在解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在时空理解上的不足，并通过新数据集REA验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs难以同时理解环境整体和近期动作的时空信息，这对现实世界中的智能体操作至关重要。

Method: 开发了ST-LLM模型，通过投影器增强空间环境理解和时间观察理解，并使用REA数据集进行验证。

Result: ST-LLM在REA数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-LLM有效提升了MLLMs的时空理解能力，为智能体操作提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are
available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.

TL;DR: LiMA是一种新型的长时图像到LiDAR记忆聚合框架，通过捕捉长时程时空相关性来增强LiDAR表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR表示策略常忽略LiDAR序列中的时空线索，限制了其效果。LiMA旨在减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，并提升LiDAR表示学习。

Method: LiMA包含三个关键模块：跨视图聚合、长时特征传播和跨序列记忆对齐，以增强时空一致性和泛化能力。

Result: 在主流LiDAR感知基准测试中，LiMA显著提升了语义分割和3D目标检测性能。

Conclusion: LiMA为自动驾驶提供了更高效的预训练范式，代码已公开。

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出LAID框架，评估轻量级神经网络在AI生成图像检测中的性能与效率，证明其在高效率和低计算成本下仍能保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI生成图像检测方法依赖计算密集型模型的问题，推动实时、大规模部署的可行性。

Method: 通过LAID框架，在GenImage数据集上全面训练和评估轻量级模型，涵盖空间、频谱和融合图像域。

Result: 轻量级模型在对抗条件下仍能实现竞争性准确率，且显著降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究为开发实用、可扩展且可信赖的检测系统奠定了基础，平衡了效率与性能的权衡。

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

TL;DR: VDG-Uni3DSeg提出了一种结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型的新框架，通过多模态线索提升3D点云分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因监督有限和多模态线索不足导致的语义和上下文信息捕捉不充分问题。

Method: 整合预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）和LLM，利用LLM生成的文本描述和网络参考图像，设计语义-视觉对比损失和空间增强模块。

Result: 在语义、实例和全景分割任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D场景理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CTA（跨任务对齐）是一种改进测试时训练（TTT）的新方法，通过多模态对比学习对齐监督和无监督编码器，提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在分布偏移（如领域或数据集变化）时性能下降，TTT通过辅助任务增强鲁棒性，但现有方法需要专用架构。

Method: CTA利用多模态对比学习对齐监督编码器和自监督编码器，避免梯度干扰，保留自监督学习的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提升了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CTA无需专用架构，通过跨任务对齐有效改进TTT，为模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 拓扑材料的跨尺度设计因低效的发现流程而受限，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: TopoMAS整合了用户查询、多源数据检索、理论推断、晶体结构生成和第一性原理验证，并通过动态知识图谱实现闭环优化。

Conclusion: TopoMAS不仅推动了拓扑材料的发现，还为材料科学领域提供了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to
their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale
design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we
introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive
human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery
pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through
theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles
validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating
computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous
knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already
guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by
first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust
adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B
model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens
required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses
twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an
accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational
agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not
only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes
a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

Result: 在三维链接结构下优化导线排列，验证了方法的有效性并讨论了设计解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂结构中的导线排列设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Conclusion: 该方法在现实世界任务（如导航）中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同数据集之间的交互和环境差异，传统方法存在域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本的问题。

Method: IMMP采用两步法：预合并以提取源域信息，合并以构建可适应目标域的模型。

Result: 在多个规划基准和模型上表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP有效解决了域适应问题，提升了运动规划的性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,
yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied.
This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset
transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in
multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4
Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the
US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset
experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred
between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

<details>

Motivation: 由于真实世界数据收集成本高且效率低，仿真环境成为训练机器人策略的重要替代方案，但Real2Sim2Real差距（尤其是物理动态和视觉外观）仍是关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出EmbodieDreamer框架，包含PhysAligner（优化物理参数）和VisAligner（通过视频扩散模型提升视觉逼真度）。

Result: PhysAligner将物理参数估计误差降低3.74%，优化速度提升89.91%；VisAligner生成的逼真环境使任务成功率提升29.17%。

Conclusion: EmbodieDreamer有效缩小了Real2Sim2Real差距，提升了机器人策略在真实世界中的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中强化学习的大规模高维动作空间会降低训练效率和增加探索成本，因此需要优化动作空间设计。

Method: 采用动态掩码和相对动作空间缩减策略，结合多模态近端策略优化（PPO）代理处理图像序列和车辆状态。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的动作空间设计对自动驾驶中强化学习的可扩展性和可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

Motivation: 探索基于位置的社交网络（LBSNs）中用户兴趣的分布模式，以及如何利用这些模式开发更智能的推荐系统。

Method: 比较Google Places和Foursquare平台上的iNETs，分析不同空间粒度下的用户行为模式，并开发多层次的推荐系统。

Result: 用户兴趣主要由地理邻近性和场所相似性驱动，社会经济和政治因素影响较小。推荐系统能适应不同用户类型（如探索者和回头客）。

Conclusion: 研究为城市移动性研究提供了可扩展、上下文感知且可解释的推荐系统，并发布了交互式工具h3-cities。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) provide a rich foundation for modeling
urban behavior through iNETs (Interest Networks), which capture how user
interests are distributed throughout urban spaces. This study compares iNETs
across platforms (Google Places and Foursquare) and spatial granularities,
showing that coarser levels reveal more consistent cross-platform patterns,
while finer granularities expose subtle, platform-specific behaviors. Our
analysis finds that, in general, user interest is primarily shaped by
geographic proximity and venue similarity, while socioeconomic and political
contexts play a lesser role. Building on these insights, we develop a
multi-level, explainable recommendation system that predicts high-interest
urban regions for different user types. The model adapts to behavior profiles
-- such as explorers, who are driven by proximity, and returners, who prefer
familiar venues -- and provides natural-language explanations using explainable
AI (XAI) techniques. To support our approach, we introduce h3-cities, a tool
for multi-scale spatial analysis, and release a public demo for interactively
exploring personalized urban recommendations. Our findings contribute to urban
mobility research by providing scalable, context-aware, and interpretable
recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI搜索引擎的崛起正在颠覆传统SEO，需要新的方法来提升内容在AI驱动搜索环境中的可见性。

Method: 使用BART-base模型对合成的旅行网站内容对进行微调，优化内容包括可信引用、统计证据和语言流畅性。

Conclusion: GEO是一种可行的内容优化方法，小规模领域微调可显著提升生成式搜索引擎中的内容可发现性。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI search engines is disrupting traditional SEO, with
Gartner predicting 25% reduction in conventional search usage by 2026. This
necessitates new approaches for web content visibility in AI-driven search
environments. We present a domain-specific fine-tuning approach for Generative
Engine Optimization (GEO) that transforms web content to improve
discoverability in large language model outputs. Our method fine-tunes a
BART-base transformer on synthetically generated training data comprising 1,905
cleaned travel website content pairs. Each pair consists of raw website text
and its GEO-optimized counterpart incorporating credible citations, statistical
evidence, and improved linguistic fluency. We evaluate using intrinsic metrics
(ROUGE-L, BLEU) and extrinsic visibility assessments through controlled
experiments with Llama-3.3-70B. The fine-tuned model achieves significant
improvements over baseline BART: ROUGE-L scores of 0.249 (vs. 0.226) and BLEU
scores of 0.200 (vs. 0.173). Most importantly, optimized content demonstrates
substantial visibility gains in generative search responses with 15.63%
improvement in absolute word count and 30.96% improvement in position-adjusted
word count metrics. This work provides the first empirical demonstration that
targeted transformer fine-tuning can effectively enhance web content visibility
in generative search engines with modest computational resources. Our results
suggest GEO represents a tractable approach for content optimization in the
AI-driven search landscape, offering concrete evidence that small-scale,
domain-focused fine-tuning yields meaningful improvements in content
discoverability.

Motivation: 传统因果森林方法中因果树的独立性可能导致分类误差重复，从而引入估计偏差。

Method: 使用LILI聚类算法连接因果树，基于叶子节点相似性构建聚类，将不同处理的实例视为反事实结果。

Result: 理论分析证明LILI聚类的ATE估计收敛，实验显示其性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LILI聚类有效减少偏差，提升因果推断准确性。

Abstract: Causal forest methods are powerful tools in causal inference. Similar to
traditional random forest in machine learning, causal forest independently
considers each causal tree. However, this independence consideration increases
the likelihood that classification errors in one tree are repeated in others,
potentially leading to significant bias in causal e ect estimation. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal
trees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm.
LILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the
similarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments
are grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they
are treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering
mechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree
methods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect
(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal
inference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by
relating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set
theory. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the convergence of the estimated
ATE using LILI clustering. Empirically, extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of LILI clustering.

Motivation: 随机试验通常缺乏统计功效来检测患者特征上的效应异质性，限制了其在个性化决策中的价值。

Method: 提出QR-learner，结合外部数据估计CATE，并引入与试验专用学习器结合的流程。

Result: QR-learner在模拟和实际数据中均提升了CATE估计和检测异质效应的统计功效。

Conclusion: QR-learner能有效利用外部数据，提升个性化决策的准确性。

Abstract: Randomized trials are typically designed to detect average treatment effects
but often lack the statistical power to uncover effect heterogeneity over
patient characteristics, limiting their value for personalized decision-making.
To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that
estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial
population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational
studies. The proposed method is robust: it has the potential to reduce the CATE
prediction mean squared error while maintaining consistency, even when the
external data is not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure
that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it
asymptotically matches or exceeds the trial-only learner in terms of mean
squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies
and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in
both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects.

Conclusion: 自适应SGD方法在监督迁移学习中可行且有效，能自动调整源和目标数据的利用，避免负迁移。

Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner
has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have
for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while
efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of
designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and
target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior
knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is
in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each
SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias
towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less
informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general
prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of
constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer
guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression
with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$
rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to
the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real
datasets support the theory.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel methodology for robustly estimating particle
size distributions from optical scattering measurements using constrained
Gaussian process regression. The estimation of particle size distributions is
commonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an
ill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise
and limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to
regularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the
Gaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using
a pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent
optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral
expansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation
without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary
strategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on
maximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative
approach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process
regression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions,
producing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results.
This methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing
inverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了扩散模型中独特的隐式正则化机制，为理解其泛化行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: The success of denoising diffusion models raises important questions
regarding their generalisation behaviour, particularly in high-dimensional
settings. Notably, it has been shown that when training and sampling are
performed perfectly, these models memorise training data -- implying that some
form of regularisation is essential for generalisation. Existing theoretical
analyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform
convergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds.
In this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote
generalisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of
algorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting. Borrowing from the
framework of algorithmic stability, we introduce the notion of score stability,
which quantifies the sensitivity of score-matching algorithms to dataset
perturbations. We derive generalisation bounds in terms of score stability, and
apply our framework to several fundamental learning settings, identifying
sources of regularisation. In particular, we consider denoising score matching
with early stopping (denoising regularisation), sampler-wide coarse
discretisation (sampler regularisation) and optimising with SGD (optimisation
regularisation). By grounding our analysis in algorithmic properties rather
than model structure, we identify multiple sources of implicit regularisation
unique to diffusion models that have so far been overlooked in the literature.

Method: 通过分析Breiman的Rashomon效应和Occam困境，结合现代计算技术，提出新的视角和方法。

Conclusion: 本文超越了Breiman的两种文化框架，展示了如何以新方法实现因果关系、简单性和准确性，解决了Breiman的担忧。

Abstract: In the famous Two Cultures paper, Leo Breiman provided a visionary
perspective on the cultures of ''data models'' (modeling with consideration of
data generation) versus ''algorithmic models'' (vanilla machine learning
models). I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's
key arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the
existence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect
implies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated
the data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is
simplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an
accuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has
become clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models
do not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help
explain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to
consider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the
Rashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam
Dilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern
computers, with which my observations are much easier to make.
  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:
simpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with
the outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the
use of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is
useful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.
  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two
Cultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,
accuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,
without the limitations Breiman was concerned about.

Result: 模型困惑度降低10%，生成困惑度降低10%，训练速度提升15%。

Conclusion: 改进的离散框架在语言建模中表现优于现有方法，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions,
their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has
shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time
discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to
autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first
introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and
learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those
established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved
upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching
performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and
corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with
up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training
steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC
transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the
analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the
computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and
generation.

Method: 提出PASTIS，其惩罚项基于极值理论，考虑了候选参数库大小、模型参数数量和显著性阈值。

Conclusion: PASTIS为随机动力学过程提供了一种统计基础强、实用且经过验证的模型发现框架。

Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and
discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible
correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard
information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information
criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B}
\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of
candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model
($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance
threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more
parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for
SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,
cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model
identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals
($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning
and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants
of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the
applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical
methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with

Conclusion: 该方法为深度强化学习中的高维动作选择提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained widespread adoption in recent
years but faces significant challenges, particularly in unknown and complex
environments. Among these, high-dimensional action selection stands out as a
critical problem. Existing works often require a sophisticated prior design to
eliminate redundancy in the action space, relying heavily on domain expert
experience or involving high computational complexity, which limits their
generalizability across different RL tasks. In this paper, we address these
challenges by proposing a general data-driven action selection approach with
model-free and computationally friendly properties. Our method not only selects
minimal sufficient actions but also controls the false discovery rate via
knockoff sampling. More importantly, we seamlessly integrate the action
selection into deep RL methods during online training. Empirical experiments
validate the established theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that our method
surpasses various alternative techniques in terms of both performance in
variable selection and overall achieved rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测（CP）作为一种不确定性表示技术，其作为UQ工具的理论基础尚不清晰，研究旨在通过范畴论方法明确其结构特性。

Method: 采用范畴论方法，将CP定义为新定义的两个范畴之间的态射，并通过交换图分析其性质。

Result: 研究发现CP本质上是UQ机制，能够连接贝叶斯、频率论和模糊概率方法，且共形预测区域（CPR）是协变函子的像。

Conclusion: CP的结构特性使其成为强大的UQ工具，且在隐私保护中具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that
delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine
Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has
remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP --
framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined
categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal
assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities
are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges
(and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic
approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a
conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This
observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added
locally does not break coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶方法迭代成本低但收敛慢，二阶方法收敛快但计算Hessian逆代价高，需要一种折中方案。

Method: 提出QMME框架，通过固定曲率的二次主化最小化，重用矩阵分解，并引入外推技术。

Result: QMME在大规模核正则化学习问题中表现优于传统一阶和二阶方法，并支持高效处理大投影维度的草图矩阵。

Conclusion: QMME提供了一种高效且实用的优化方法，适用于大规模问题，并开源了可复现的实验代码。

Abstract: First-order methods in convex optimization offer low per-iteration cost but
often suffer from slow convergence, while second-order methods achieve fast
local convergence at the expense of costly Hessian inversions. In this paper,
we highlight a middle ground: minimizing a quadratic majorant with fixed
curvature at each iteration. This strategy strikes a balance between
per-iteration cost and convergence speed, and crucially allows the reuse of
matrix decompositions, such as Cholesky or spectral decompositions, across
iterations and varying regularization parameters. We introduce the Quadratic
Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (QMME) framework and establish its
sequential convergence properties under standard assumptions. The new
perspective of our analysis is to center the arguments around the induced norm
of the curvature matrix $H$. To demonstrate practical advantages, we apply QMME
to large-scale kernel regularized learning problems. In particular, we propose
a novel Sylvester equation modelling technique for kernel multinomial
regression. In Julia-based experiments, QMME compares favorably against various
established first- and second-order methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
our algorithms complement existing kernel approximation techniques through more
efficiently handling sketching matrices with large projection dimensions. Our
numerical experiments and real data analysis are available and fully
reproducible at https://github.com/qhengncsu/QMME.jl.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在固定预算和固定置信度设置下表现优异，任务难度主要由少数臂决定。

Abstract: We study the Pareto Set Identification (PSI) problem in a structured
multi-output linear bandit model. In this setting, each arm is associated a
feature vector belonging to $\mathbb{R}^h$, and its mean vector in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ linearly depends on this feature vector through a common unknown
matrix $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$. The goal is to identify the set of
non-dominated arms by adaptively collecting samples from the arms. We introduce
and analyze the first optimal design-based algorithms for PSI, providing nearly
optimal guarantees in both the fixed-budget and the fixed-confidence settings.
Notably, we show that the difficulty of these tasks mainly depends on the
sub-optimality gaps of $h$ arms only. Our theoretical results are supported by
an extensive benchmark on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: This work aims to estimate the drift and diffusion functions in stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) driven by a particular class of L\'evy processes
with finite jump intensity, using neural networks. We propose a framework that
integrates the Tamed-Milstein scheme with neural networks employed as
non-parametric function approximators. Estimation is carried out in a
non-parametric fashion for the drift function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}
\), the diffusion coefficient \( g: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \). The model of
interest is given by \[ dX(t) = \xi + f(X(t))\, dt + g(X(t))\, dW_t + \gamma
\int_{\mathbb{Z}} z\, N(dt,dz), \] where \( W_t \) is a standard Brownian
motion, and \( N(dt,dz) \) is a Poisson random measure on \( (~\mathbb{R}_{+}
~\times ~\mathbb{Z}~, ~\mathcal{B}~(~\mathbb{R}_{+}~)~\otimes~\mathcal{Z}~,~
\lambda( \Lambda~\otimes~v~)~) \), with \( \lambda, \gamma > 0 \), \( \Lambda
\) being the Lebesgue measure on \( \mathbb{R}_{+} \), and \( v \) a finite
measure on the measurable space \( (\mathbb{Z}, \mathcal{Z}) \).
  Neural networks are used as non-parametric function approximators, enabling
the modeling of complex nonlinear dynamics without assuming restrictive
functional forms. The proposed methodology constitutes a flexible alternative
for inference in systems with state-dependent noise and discontinuities driven
by L\'evy processes.

Conclusion: 论文提出的CROMS和CROiMS框架为CRO提供了统一的模型选择方法，显著提升了决策效率和鲁棒性，尤其在个体化模型选择方面具有创新性。

Abstract: In decision-making under uncertainty, Contextual Robust Optimization (CRO)
provides reliability by minimizing the worst-case decision loss over a
prediction set, hedging against label variability. While recent advances use
conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for machine learning models,
the downstream decisions critically depend on model selection. This paper
introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness
control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust
Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), which automatically selects models
to approximately minimize the average decision risk in CRO solutions. We
develop two algorithms: E-CROMS, which is computationally efficient, and
F-CROMS, which enjoys a marginal robustness guarantee in finite samples.
Further, we introduce Conformalized Robust Optimization with Individualized
Model Selection (CROiMS), which performs individualized model selection by
minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariate of test data. This
framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware
model selection. Theoretically, CROiMS achieves asymptotic conditional
robustness and decision efficiency under mild assumptions. Numerical results
demonstrate significant improvements in decision efficiency and robustness
across diverse synthetic and real-world applications, outperforming baseline
approaches.

Conclusion: 通过简单的模块设计，成功实现了高表达性与解耦潜在结构的并存，为生成模型的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In designing generative models, it is commonly believed that in order to
learn useful latent structure, we face a fundamental tension between
expressivity and structure. In this paper we challenge this view by proposing a
new approach to training arbitrarily expressive generative models that
simultaneously learn disentangled latent structure. This is accomplished by
adding a simple decoder-only module to the head of an existing decoder block
that can be arbitrarily complex. The module learns to process concept
information by implicitly inverting linear representations from an encoder.
Inspired by the notion of intervention in causal graphical models, our module
selectively modifies its architecture during training, allowing it to learn a
compact joint model over different contexts. We show how adding this module
leads to disentangled representations that can be composed for
out-of-distribution generation. To further validate our proposed approach, we
prove a new identifiability result that extends existing work on identifying
structured representations in nonlinear models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种能够高效逼近交互组件、预测稳定且对噪声特征不敏感的神经网络模型。

Method: 采用指示激活神经元，结合随机训练和bagging技术，构建增强版01Neuro框架。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上表现优异，逼近交互组件能力强，预测稳定性高，但对计算资源需求较大。

Conclusion: 01Neuro在功能逼近和稳定性方面表现突出，但需优化计算效率以提升实用性。

Abstract: We propose a new neural network model, 01Neuro, built on indicator activation
neurons. Its boosted variant possesses two key statistical properties: (1) Sure
Convergence, where model optimization can be achieved with high probability
given sufficient computational resources; and (2) Constructive Universal
Approximation: In the infinite sample setting, the model can approximate any
finite sum of measurable functions, each depending on only k out of p input
features, provided the architecture is properly tuned. Unlike most universal
approximation results that are agnostic to training procedures, our guarantees
are directly tied to the model's explicit construction and optimization
algorithm. To improve prediction stability, we integrate stochastic training
and bagging into the boosted 01Neuro framework. Empirical evaluations on
simulated and real-world tabular datasets with small to medium sample sizes
highlight its strengths: effective approximation of interaction components
(multiplicative terms), stable prediction performance (comparable to Random
Forests), robustness to many noisy features, and insensitivity to feature
scaling. A major limitation of the current implementation of boosted 01Neuro is
its higher computational cost, which is approximately 5 to 30 times that of
Random Forests and XGBoost.

Result: VIF方法在计算效率和准确性上优于现有方法，且适用于非高斯似然。

Conclusion: VIF方法是一种高效、准确且数值稳定的高斯过程近似方法，已开源实现。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely
used in machine learning and statistics. However, their scalability to large
data sets is limited by computational constraints. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Vecchia-inducing-points full-scale (VIF) approximations
combining the strengths of global inducing points and local Vecchia
approximations. Vecchia approximations excel in settings with low-dimensional
inputs and moderately smooth covariance functions, while inducing point methods
are better suited to high-dimensional inputs and smoother covariance functions.
Our VIF approach bridges these two regimes by using an efficient
correlation-based neighbor-finding strategy for the Vecchia approximation of
the residual process, implemented via a modified cover tree algorithm. We
further extend our framework to non-Gaussian likelihoods by introducing
iterative methods that substantially reduce computational costs for training
and prediction by several orders of magnitudes compared to Cholesky-based
computations when using a Laplace approximation. In particular, we propose and
compare novel preconditioners and provide theoretical convergence results.
Extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data sets show that
VIF approximations are both computationally efficient as well as more accurate
and numerically stable than state-of-the-art alternatives. All methods are
implemented in the open source C++ library GPBoost with high-level Python and R
interfaces.

Abstract: In this chapter, we utilize dynamical systems to analyze several aspects of
machine learning algorithms. As an expository contribution we demonstrate how
to re-formulate a wide variety of challenges from deep neural networks,
(stochastic) gradient descent, and related topics into dynamical statements. We
also tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of
information propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the
input-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal
embedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions
of given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural
ODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural
delay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks
dynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent
and study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis
to the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon,
also in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic
gradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized
setting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain
several results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks. We describe a
result that extends existing techniques to heterogeneous neural networks
involving graph limits via digraph measures. This shows how large classes of
neural networks naturally fall within the framework of Kuramoto-type models on
graphs and their large-graph limits. Finally, we point out that similar
strategies to use dynamics to study explainable and reliable AI can also be
applied to settings such as generative models or fundamental issues in gradient
training methods, such as backpropagation or vanishing/exploding gradients.

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration
of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement
learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have
traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through
Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin
destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected
tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a
consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization
across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports
multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups
with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor
decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large
scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control
strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and
operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT
framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and
practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation
integrated mobility systems.

Abstract: Developing algorithms for real-life problems that perform well in practice
highly depends on the availability of realistic data for testing. Obtaining
real-life data for optimization problems in health care, however, is often
difficult. This is especially true for any patient related optimization
problems, e.g., for patient-to-room assignment, due to data privacy policies.
Furthermore, obtained real-life data usually cannot be published which
prohibits reproducibility of results by other researchers. Therefore, often
artificially generated instances are used. In this paper, we present
combinatorial insights about the feasibility of instances for the
patient-to-room assignment problem (PRA). We use these insights to develop a
configurable instance generator for PRA with an easy-to-use graphical user
interface. Configurability is in this case especially important as we observed
in an extensive analysis of real-life data that, e.g., the probability
distribution for patients' age and length of stay depends on the respective
ward.

Conclusion: 论文在信息受限和切换成本的约束下，提出了高效的在线优化算法，并分析了其性能。

Abstract: Online convex optimization with switching cost is considered under the frugal
information setting where at time $t$, before action $x_t$ is taken, only a
single function evaluation and a single gradient is available at the previously
chosen action $x_{t-1}$ for either the current cost function $f_t$ or the most
recent cost function $f_{t-1}$. When the switching cost is linear, online
algorithms with optimal order-wise competitive ratios are derived for the
frugal setting. When the gradient information is noisy, an online algorithm
whose competitive ratio grows quadratically with the noise magnitude is
derived.

Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing
rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes
industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control
devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic
implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a
stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level
Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level
physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their
sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the
system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization
scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at
the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic
integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL --
presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading
to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability
pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box
operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work
presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization
framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.

Motivation: 扩展MEOCP，通过同时优化策略和先验分布，提升控制问题的灵活性和性能。

Method: 在高斯分布假设下，分别固定先验和策略，推导最优解，并提出交替最小化算法求解MIOCP。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了算法的有效性，并讨论了其工作原理。

Conclusion: MIOCP为控制问题提供了更灵活的框架，交替最小化算法在实际应用中表现良好。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a mutual information optimal control problem
(MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems. This problem can be regarded as an
extension of a maximum entropy optimal control problem (MEOCP). Differently
from the MEOCP where the prior is fixed to the uniform distribution, the MIOCP
optimizes the policy and prior simultaneously. As analytical results, under the
policy and prior classes consisting of Gaussian distributions, we derive the
optimal policy and prior of the MIOCP with the prior and policy fixed,
respectively. Using the results, we propose an alternating minimization
algorithm for the MIOCP. Through numerical experiments, we discuss how our
proposed algorithm works.
