### [1] [Subjective Evaluation Profile Analysis of Science Fiction Short Stories and its Critical-Theoretical Significance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11582)
*Kazuyoshi Otsuka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究将大语言模型（LLMs）作为“主观文学评论家”，探讨其在文学评估中的审美偏好和评价模式。通过分析十篇日本科幻短篇小说的翻译文本，发现LLMs在评价一致性和模式上存在显著差异，并揭示了其独特的评价词汇和潜在价值体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在文学评估中的表现，验证其是否具有类似人类批评家的个体化评价特征，而非中立基准工具。

Method: 将十篇日本科幻小说翻译为英文，由六种先进LLMs进行七次独立评估，采用主成分分析和聚类技术分析评价模式和一致性。

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α值1.00至0.35），识别出五种评价模式，且不同模型的评价词汇独特。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备类似人类批评流派的个体化评价特征，而非单纯中立工具。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

### [2] [MapIQ: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Map Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11625)
*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapIQ基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，涵盖多种地图类型和主题，并分析了模型对地图设计变化的敏感性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要局限于等值区域图（choropleth maps），覆盖的主题和视觉分析任务有限，因此需要更全面的数据集和评估方法。

Method: 提出MapIQ数据集，包含14,706个问答对，覆盖三种地图类型和六个主题，评估了多种MLLMs在六项视觉分析任务中的表现，并与人类基线对比。

Result: 实验表明MLLMs在不同地图类型和任务中的表现差异显著，且对地图设计变化敏感，揭示了模型对内部地理知识的依赖。

Conclusion: MapIQ为Map-VQA研究提供了更全面的基准，未来可通过优化地图设计和模型训练提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

### [3] [Cross-lingual Few-shot Learning for Persian Sentiment Analysis with Incremental Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11634)
*Farideh Majidi,Ziaeddin Beheshtifard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在波斯语中使用少样本学习和增量学习方法进行跨语言情感分析，目标是利用高资源语言的知识开发适用于低资源语言的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决波斯语情感分析中数据稀缺的问题，同时利用高资源语言的知识提升模型性能。

Method: 使用XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT三种预训练多语言模型，通过少样本和增量学习在小规模波斯语数据上进行微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa表现最佳，达到96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型在低资源语言情感分析中效果显著。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

### [4] [Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661)
*Guimin Hu,Yi Xin,Lijie Hu,Zhihong Zhu,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PgM框架通过分割模态特征为单模态和配对模态部分，结合专用学习组件和解码器，提升多模态学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，单模态和配对模态特征的学习需求不同，需要更灵活和全面的学习框架。

Method: 提出PgM框架，包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和解码器，支持特征分割、学习和重构。

Result: PgM在四项多模态任务中表现优异，并展示了对现有模型的迁移能力。

Conclusion: PgM通过特征分割和灵活学习策略，有效提升了多模态学习的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

### [5] [AI Wizards at CheckThat! 2025: Enhancing Transformer-Based Embeddings with Sentiment for Subjectivity Detection in News Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11764)
*Matteo Fasulo,Luca Babboni,Luca Tedeschini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Wizards团队在CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab Task 1中，通过结合情感分数与句子表示，提升了基于Transformer的分类器在主观性检测任务中的表现，尤其在零样本和多语言场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在改进新闻文章中句子主观性检测的性能，特别是在多语言和零样本设置下，以评估模型的泛化能力。

Method: 团队采用基于Transformer的模型（如mDeBERTaV3-base、ModernBERT-base和Llama3.2-1B），并集成情感分数作为辅助特征，同时通过决策阈值校准解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 实验表明，情感特征的引入显著提升了性能，尤其是在主观F1分数上，团队在希腊语任务中排名第一（Macro F1 = 0.51）。

Conclusion: 该框架在多语言和零样本场景下表现出色，证明了情感特征集成和阈值校准的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

### [6] [ExpliCIT-QA: Explainable Code-Based Image Table Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11694)
*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Álvaro Bueno Sáez,Pedro Alonso Doval,Jorge Alcalde Vesteiro,Héctor Cerezo-Costas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExpliCIT-QA是一个多模态表格问答系统，通过模块化设计提供可解释的答案，包括表格理解、语言推理、代码生成、执行和解释生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端表格问答系统中可解释性不足的问题，适用于金融和医疗等敏感领域。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括多模态表格理解、语言推理、自动代码生成、代码执行和自然语言解释。

Result: 在TableVQA-Bench基准测试中表现优于现有基线，提高了可解释性和透明度。

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA为敏感领域的表格问答系统提供了可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

### [7] [CRABS: A syntactic-semantic pincer strategy for bounding LLM interpretation of Python notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11742)
*Meng Li,Timothy M. McPhillips,Dingmin Wang,Shin-Rong Tsai,Bertram Ludäscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRABS的方法，通过结合浅层语法分析和LLM，解决Python笔记本中信息流和依赖关系的理解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习笔记本的依赖关系复杂，直接重新执行笔记本不切实际，而现有LLM在处理长上下文和避免幻觉方面存在不足。

Method: CRABS方法结合浅层语法分析（AST）和LLM的零样本学习，捕获笔记本的输入输出集，并通过LLM解决剩余歧义。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上测试，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法有效解决了笔记本理解问题，结合语法分析和LLM的策略显著提升了准确性。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

### [8] [Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12425)
*Chandana Cheerla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在处理企业异构数据时的局限性，如静态预训练、短上下文窗口和结构化数据处理的挑战。

Method: 结合密集嵌入和BM25的混合检索策略，使用SpaCy NER进行元数据过滤，并采用交叉编码器重排序和语义分块技术。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，Mean Reciprocal Rank提升16%，定性评估也显著改善。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了企业任务的响应质量，未来将扩展到多模态数据和基于代理的检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

### [9] [Tracing Facts or just Copies? A critical investigation of the Competitions of Mechanisms in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11809)
*Dante Campregher,Yanxu Chen,Sander Hoffman,Maria Heuss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过可重复性实验探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何处理竞争性事实与反事实信息，重点关注注意力头的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在验证和调和Ortu等人、Yu、Merullo、Pavlick以及McDougall等人的研究结果，探索模型学习的事实与矛盾上下文信息之间的竞争机制。

Method: 使用机制解释工具，分析注意力头强度与事实输出比例的关系，评估关于注意力头抑制机制的竞争性假设，并研究这些注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 发现促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制实现，且其行为具有领域依赖性，较大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 注意力头的作用机制是通用且领域依赖的，强化它们可能同时抑制正确事实，模型规模影响其行为特异性。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

### [10] [ILID: Native Script Language Identification for Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11832)
*Yash Ingle,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发布了一个包含英语和22种印度官方语言的23万句子数据集，并开发了基于机器学习和深度学习的基线模型，用于语言识别任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言识别是NLP的基础任务，尤其在多语言环境中面临挑战，如噪声、短文本和代码混合。印度语言因共享脚本和相似性而更具难度。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，并开发了基于机器学习和深度学习的基线模型。

Result: 基线模型在语言识别任务上表现与最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: 数据集和基线模型为印度语言识别研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

### [11] [Your LLM Knows the Future: Uncovering Its Multi-Token Prediction Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11851)
*Mohammad Samragh,Arnav Kundu,David Harrison,Kumari Nishu,Devang Naik,Minsik Cho,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，通过多令牌预测提升自回归语言模型的推理速度和并行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型的顺序生成特性限制了推理速度和并行性，尤其是在文本方向和语义已确定的后期阶段。

Method: 结合掩码输入、门控LoRA、轻量采样器、辅助训练损失和推测生成策略，实现多令牌预测。

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升约2.5倍，且质量无损失。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了自回归模型的效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

*Junhong Ye,Xu Yuan,Xinying Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了跨领域模型迁移、多领域数据融合和样本高效学习在PII识别中的效果，发现法律领域数据能较好迁移到传记文本，而医疗领域则难以迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过跨领域模型迁移、数据融合和少样本学习提高PII识别的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用医疗（I2B2）、法律（TAB）和传记（Wikipedia）的标注语料库，评估模型在四个维度：领域内性能、跨领域迁移性、数据融合和少样本学习。

Result: 法律领域数据能较好迁移到传记文本，医疗领域数据难以迁移；数据融合效果因领域而异；低专业化领域仅需10%训练数据即可实现高质量识别。

Conclusion: 跨领域迁移和数据融合的效果具有领域特异性，少样本学习在低专业化领域表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient
learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2),
legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four
dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and
few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to
biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

TL;DR: COLA-GEC框架通过双向知识转移提升语法错误纠正（GEC）和语法可接受性判断（COLA）任务，实现多语言基准的最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEC和COLA任务共享语法知识但独立发展，需探索其协同效应。

Method: 1. 用GEC数据增强语法可接受性模型；2. 通过动态损失函数将语法可接受性信号融入GEC训练。

Result: 在多语言基准上达到最优表现，但标点错误纠正仍有挑战。

Conclusion: COLA-GEC框架有效提升任务性能，未来需进一步优化语法建模。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and grammatical acceptability judgment
(COLA) are core tasks in natural language processing, sharing foundational
grammatical knowledge yet typically evolving independently. This paper
introduces COLA-GEC, a novel bidirectional framework that enhances both tasks
through mutual knowledge transfer. First, we augment grammatical acceptability
models using GEC datasets, significantly improving their performance across
multiple languages. Second, we integrate grammatical acceptability signals into
GEC model training via a dynamic loss function, effectively guiding corrections
toward grammatically acceptable outputs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results on several multilingual benchmarks. Comprehensive error analysis
highlights remaining challenges, particularly in punctuation error correction,
providing insights for future improvements in grammatical modeling.

### [14] [DualReward: A Dynamic Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cloze Tests Distractor Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11875)
*Tianyou Huang,Xinglu Chen,Jingshen Zhang,Xinying Qiu,Ruiying Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualReward是一种新颖的强化学习框架，用于自动生成完形填空测试中的干扰项，通过双奖励结构和自适应缩放机制优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要依赖监督学习或静态生成模型，无法动态区分人类创建的干扰项和模型生成的候选干扰项。DualReward旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双奖励结构和自适应缩放机制，动态调整奖励信号强度，基于模型性能和置信度。

Result: 在CLOTH-F和MCQ数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在跨域数据（MCQ）上提升显著（3.48-3.86% P@1）。

Conclusion: DualReward提供了一种灵活的框架，能有效平衡从可靠人类示例中学习和探索高质量干扰项。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively

### [15] [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878)
*Jiachen Zhao,Jing Huang,Zhengxuan Wu,David Bau,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部将“有害性”与“拒绝”作为两个独立概念，并提出了“有害性方向”和“潜在防护”机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正理解有害性，而非仅机械拒绝。

Method: 识别“有害性方向”与“拒绝方向”，并通过实验验证其独立性及影响。

Result: 发现某些越狱方法通过降低拒绝信号而非改变有害性判断，且微调攻击对有害性信念影响有限。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更稳健，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多语言指令跟随基准Marco-Bench-MIF，覆盖30种语言，解决了现有数据集在语言和文化上的局限性，并分析了LLMs在多语言环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令跟随数据集多为英语或机器翻译，限制了在多语言环境中的应用，因此需要开发一个更本地化的多语言基准。

Method: 通过结合翻译与验证的混合流程，创建了Marco-Bench-MIF，涵盖30种语言，并调整了语言和文化约束。

Result: 评估发现：(1)高低资源语言间存在25-35%的准确率差距；(2)模型规模对性能影响显著（45-60%），但仍存在特定脚本的挑战；(3)机器翻译数据低估了准确率7-22%。

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF揭示了多语言指令跟随的挑战，如关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循，为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at
https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Bench-MIF.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是首个大规模多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言的22,606张图表和26,151个问答对，旨在解决现有基准的英语中心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要基于英语，限制了其全球适用性。PolyChartQA旨在填补这一空白，推动多语言图表理解研究。

Method: 采用解耦流水线，分离图表数据和渲染代码，通过翻译数据和复用代码生成多语言图表，并利用LLM翻译和严格质量控制确保一致性。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的BPE算法，优化了批量推理工作流，比现有方法快2-2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU绑定的BPE实现（如HuggingFace Tokenizers和tiktoken）在GPU批量推理中效率低下，BlockBPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词步骤，实现高度并行化的分词合并，将复杂度从O(n log n)降至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE显著提升了GPU批量推理的效率，尽管生成质量略有损失，但性能提升显著。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合信息熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，实现细粒度压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了注意力关键令牌和压缩过程中熵的变化，导致压缩效果受限。

Method: 提出DAC方法，动态整合熵和注意力信息，感知压缩过程中的熵变化。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K和BBH）的实验表明，DAC在各种任务和大型语言模型上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DAC方法通过动态感知熵和注意力信息，显著提升了提示压缩的效果。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化注意力计算和KV缓存使用，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有优化方法未充分利用外部信息。

Method: 提出IAM框架，通过分析注意力矩阵相似性并选择映射层，实现小规模与大规模LLM间的注意力映射。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: IAM具有通用性，且与现有KV缓存优化方法正交，是提升LLM效率的有效工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.

Motivation: LLM部署因高计算资源需求而困难，现有PoT量化在GPU上效率不足。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准，提出高效反量化方法。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下超越现有整数量化方法，GPU上反量化速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架在低精度下高效且准确，显著加速LLM推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，低资源语言和方言的翻译常无法保留本地俚语、混合代码和文化嵌入的有害言论标记，标准翻译系统对此表现不佳。

Method: 1. 人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选和排序标注者选定的Singlish-目标语言示例；2. 通过直接和回译的语义相似性，优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估验证了框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升翻译质量，还支持低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核和基准测试，强调了在现实应用中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Result: 价值相似性高的代理对表现出更强的信任和亲密感。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并揭示了价值影响关系建立的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，简化定义会显著降低多义词定义的完整性，增加误解风险。通过微调模型可以改善定义质量，强调了在教育NLP中平衡简洁性与完整性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨简化定义对多义词解释质量的影响，尤其是在不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）中的适用性。

Method: 使用两种新评估数据集，测试多个LLM模型（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4等），并通过LLM-as-Judge和人工标注评估简化定义的效果。

Result: 简化定义会显著降低多义词定义的完整性，微调Llama 3.1 8B模型能显著提升定义质量。

Conclusion: 教育NLP需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Motivation: 研究旨在比较人类和LLMs在语言创造力方面的表现，特别是在生成新词和隐喻语言使用上的能力。

Method: 设计了包含多种任务的测试，评估了24名人类和24个LLMs的表现，并使用OCSAI工具自动评估其答案的原创性、精细度和灵活性。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准上优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项中表现更好。人类更倾向于扩展性创造力（E-creativity），而LLMs则偏向固定性创造力（F-creativity）。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言创造力方面表现优于人类，但两者在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Result: 结果显示，即使是较新的大型推理模型也无法在所有测试问题中可靠地确定正确方向。

Conclusion: LLM在方向推理任务中仍有局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason
about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of
templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD
given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of
variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in
the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are
unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper
summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非神经网络的、计算成本低但可解释的方法，以有效检测机器生成文本。

Method: 使用spaCy模型进行文本预处理和特征提取，结合轻量梯度提升机分类器，并优化参数以利用大规模训练集。

Result: 通过大规模训练集和参数优化，提升了分类器的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时，实现了对机器生成文本的有效检测。

Abstract: This submission to the binary AI detection task is based on a modular
stylometric pipeline, where: public spaCy models are used for text
preprocessing (including tokenisation, named entity recognition, dependency
parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphology annotation) and extracting
several thousand features (frequencies of n-grams of the above linguistic
annotations); light-gradient boosting machines are used as the classifier. We
collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the
classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the
classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach
follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach
found effective previously.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动标注长文本共指消解的方法，并创建了首个书籍规模的基准数据集BOOKCOREF，实验表明现有系统在长文本上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共指消解基准主要针对短文本，缺乏对长文本（如书籍）的评估能力，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种自动标注管道，用于生成高质量的长文本共指消解标注，并基于此创建了BOOKCOREF数据集。

Result: 实验显示，现有系统在BOOKCOREF上表现提升有限，但该数据集为长文本共指消解研究提供了新资源。

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF为长文本共指消解研究提供了重要基准，揭示了现有模型的不足，并鼓励未来研究改进。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了结合苏格拉底法、思维链推理、简化游戏化和形成性反馈的MEGA方法对大学生数学学习的影响，发现MEGA方法比传统逐步方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多学生在数学学习中遇到困难，导致他们回避数学相关学科，而这些问题往往源于教学方法不佳。

Method: 采用MEGA方法（结合多种教学策略）与传统逐步方法对比，通过随机分配问题进行组内设计，评估两种方法的效果。

Result: 结果显示，MEGA方法在两种数据集（GSM8K和MATH）中均被学生认为更有效，尤其在难度较高的MATH数据集中表现更优（47.5% vs 26.67%）。

Conclusion: MEGA方法在解释复杂数学问题时表现更佳，适合提升学生的数学学习效果。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估大语言模型（LLM）文本增强的框架，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），验证了GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率上的最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保留方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时导致的冗余和不稳定性。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析和IASR，用于衡量语义一致性和递归释义中的语义漂移。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo表现最佳，应用于BERTopic任务时，主题粒度增加400%，完全消除了主题重叠。

Conclusion: 验证了所提框架在实际NLP流程中评估LLM增强的实用性。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务通过三步评估生成模型的理解能力：问题生成、回答和评分，发现现有方法在问题质量评估和答案限制方面存在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过共享任务为生成语言模型提供可测试的高层次评估标准。

Method: 采用三步评估法（问题生成、回答、评分），使用多语言和多来源测试材料，并对比自动与人工评估。

Result: 发现现有方法在问题质量评估和答案限制方面存在问题，LLM-as-a-Judge范式在评分中存在误判。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成和答案限制的评估策略，LLM-as-a-Judge范式需优化以减少误判。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解翻译行为背后的认知和情感机制，通过行为数据揭示隐藏的思维结构。

Method: 方法包括分析击键和眼动数据，构建多层嵌套的BTSS，并基于此开发计算翻译代理模拟翻译过程。

Result: 研究结果表明BTSS能有效描述翻译行为的动态模式，包括情感、自动行为和认知的交互。

Conclusion: 结论指出BTSS为翻译行为建模提供了新框架，有助于开发更智能的翻译工具。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了一种在低资源环境下无需自动语音识别（ASR）的孤立词阅读评估方法，通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，使用自监督学习（SSL）模型编码，发现SSL在处理儿童语音时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境中，传统的自动语音识别（ASR）方法可能不适用，因此需要探索无需ASR的替代方案，尤其是针对儿童语音的评估。

Method: 采用少量样本（few-shot）方法，将儿童语音输入与成人提供的参考模板进行比较，利用SSL模型的中间层进行编码，并研究了离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在成人语音上表现良好，但在儿童语音上效果显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL在低资源语音任务中表现优异，但在少量样本分类系统中处理儿童语音时存在明显局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，利用LLM提升ASR中关键词识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时的不足。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最先进性能，同时保持了非关键词文本的高准确性。

Conclusion: 多粒度框架中的词级和短语级组件相互补充，显著提升了性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-index的定量测量方法，用于评估翻译文本的翻译风格（translationese），通过对比微调的语言模型计算。实验证明T-index在跨域设置中具有泛化能力，并与人类判断一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU、COMET）未涵盖翻译风格（translationese），因此需要一种新的定量测量方法。

Method: 使用两个对比微调的语言模型（0.5B参数）计算T-index，并在合成数据集和真实翻译数据集上验证其泛化性和有效性。

Result: T-index能有效捕捉翻译风格，与人类标注的翻译风格差异高度相关（Pearson's r = 0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种稳健且高效的翻译风格测量方法，可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

TL;DR: Infherno是一个基于LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具的端到端框架，用于将自由形式的临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源，解决了现有方法的泛化性和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如模块化规则系统或LLM指令调优）在将临床笔记转换为FHIR资源时存在泛化性不足和结构不一致的问题。

Method: 提出Infherno框架，结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，实现端到端的转换。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现优异，接近人类基准，并支持自定义和合成数据。

Conclusion: Infherno为临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现良好，但缺乏针对硬件描述语言（如VHDL）的评估和改进研究。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤，结合原始输入提示，提升LLMs在VHDL任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在多个指标上显著优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅提高了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量，还为未来改进代码LLMs提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的作用，为开发更公平的AD检测模型提供依据。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值）。

Result: 男性语音更易被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语音部分与AD识别负相关。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

Result: 辩论框架显著提升Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B性能，Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率76.7%。

Conclusion: 辩论框架是增强LLM能力的有效方法，为开发更鲁棒的语言理解系统提供重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索 LLMs 在实时网页浏览能力下，能否直接获取和分析社交媒体数据，尤其是推断用户 demographics 的能力。

Method: 方法包括使用合成的 48 个 X（Twitter）账户数据集和 1,384 名国际参与者的调查数据集，评估 LLMs 的预测能力。

Result: 结果显示，LLMs 能够访问社交媒体内容并合理准确地预测用户 demographics，但也可能引入性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这种能力对计算社会科学有潜力，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公共应用中的使用，仅保留已验证的研究用途。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

### [46] [Probing for Arithmetic Errors in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12379)
*Yucheng Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型内部激活可用于检测算术错误，通过简单探针解码隐藏状态，训练轻量级错误检测器，并扩展到复杂任务，实现选择性重新提示以提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否能够用于检测算术错误，以验证模型自我纠正的可行性。

Method: 从3位数加法任务开始，训练简单探针解码隐藏状态，构建错误检测器，并扩展到结构化思维链任务。

Result: 探针能准确解码模型预测和正确答案，错误检测器准确率超90%，且能泛化到复杂任务。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，轻量级探针为模型自我纠正提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

TL;DR: 通过分析推理语言模型生成的思维链（CoTs），研究发现基于CoT激活的线性探针能更准确地预测最终回答的安全性，优于文本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用CoTs预测最终回答的不对齐风险，以提升模型生成内容的安全性。

Method: 评估了多种监测方法，包括人类、大语言模型和文本分类器，比较了基于CoT文本和激活的预测效果。

Result: 基于CoT激活的线性探针显著优于文本方法，且能在推理未完成时提前预测安全性。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可用于实时安全监测和早期干预，适用于不同规模和类型的模型。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于球形切片Wasserstein距离的变分自编码器（S2WTM），用于解决传统VAE-NTMs中的后验坍塌问题，并在主题建模中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE-NTMs在建模高维文本数据的超球面潜在表示时容易发生后验坍塌，导致潜在表示失效。

Method: S2WTM采用单位超球面上的先验分布，并利用球形切片Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验。

Result: 实验表明，S2WTM优于现有主题模型，生成更连贯且多样化的主题，并在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: S2WTM有效解决了后验坍塌问题，提升了主题建模的性能和效果。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索显式优化数据选择方法的效果，以解决实践中隐含目标的问题。

Method: 提出BETR方法，通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全语料库的分数。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在10个任务中的9个上表现优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍。

Conclusion: 结论显示，直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且选择策略需适应模型规模。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of

backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

TL;DR: MLLMs作为验证器在复杂任务中存在一致性偏差问题，提出SGV方法显著提升验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）扩展AI验证器的能力，利用MLLMs的世界知识和推理能力。

Method: 提出Self-Grounded Verification (SGV)，通过无条件与条件生成结合，分两步利用MLLMs的采样机制。

Result: SGV使MLLM验证器准确率提升20%，任务完成率提升48%，在多领域任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SGV方法有效解决了MLLMs作为验证器时的一致性偏差问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

Conclusion: 结合前向和后向生成方法能有效提升动态规划建模的自动化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将GPU并行计算引入DFS，同时保持了最优性保证，为搜索算法的性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Conclusion: Aime为多智能体协作提供了更灵活、高效的框架，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: 训练后的无人机注意力集中在光流不连续和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫飞行。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机简单控制策略开发提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics
often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with
generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces
BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics.
Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance
heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building
characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome
Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic.
This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded
heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.

*Yuhao Chen,Shuochen Liu,Yuanjie Lyu,Chao Zhang,Jiayao Shi,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对中国象棋（Xiangqi）的LLM训练框架，通过多阶段训练提升模型在空间战略推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在空间战略推理中的不足，尤其是复杂且完全可观察的棋盘游戏（如中国象棋）。

Method: 采用多阶段训练：1）微调合法移动预测；2）加入战略注释；3）通过GRPO强化学习优化推理稳定性。

Result: Xiangqi-R1模型在合法移动和分析准确性上分别提升18%和22%，显著优于通用LLMs。

Conclusion: 研究为在空间复杂领域构建通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

### [63] [Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11866)

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相似性引导的扩散方法（SimDiffRec），用于对比序列推荐系统，通过生成语义一致的噪声和选择高置信度位置进行增强，提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多采用随机增强，可能破坏原始序列的上下文信息，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保留上下文和结构信息。

Method: 利用物品嵌入向量的相似性生成语义一致的噪声，并在去噪过程中选择高置信度位置进行增强。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，SimDiffRec优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 相似性引导的扩散方法能更有效地保留上下文信息，提升推荐性能和训练效率。

Abstract: In sequential recommendation systems, data augmentation and contrastive
learning techniques have recently been introduced using diffusion models to
achieve robust representation learning. However, most of the existing
approaches use random augmentation, which risk damaging the contextual
information of the original sequence. Accordingly, we propose a
Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Contrastive Sequential Recommendation. Our
method leverages the similarity between item embedding vectors to generate
semantically consistent noise. Moreover, we utilize high confidence score in
the denoising process to select our augmentation positions. This approach more
effectively reflects contextual and structural information compared to
augmentation at random positions. From a contrastive learning perspective, the
proposed augmentation technique provides more discriminative positive and
negative samples, simultaneously improving training efficiency and
recommendation performance. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
show that SimDiffRec outperforms the existing baseline models.

Conclusion: 语义感知的特征编码在易出错的通信环境中能有效提升检索性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes a search and retrieval model that adopts
key semantic communication principles from retrieval-augmented generation. We
specifically present an information-theoretic analysis of a remote document
retrieval system operating over a symbol erasure channel. The proposed model
encodes the feature vector of a query, derived from term-frequency weights of a
language corpus by using a repetition code with an adaptive rate dependent on
the contextual importance of the terms. At the decoder, we select between two
documents based on the contextual closeness of the recovered query. By
leveraging a jointly Gaussian approximation for both the true and reconstructed
similarity scores, we derive an explicit expression for the retrieval error
probability, i.e., the probability under which the less similar document is
selected. Numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world data (Google NQ)
confirm the validity of the analysis. They further demonstrate that assigning
greater redundancy to critical features effectively reduces the error rate,
highlighting the effectiveness of semantic-aware feature encoding in
error-prone communication settings.

Motivation: 理解并解释基于Transformer的黑盒模型内部机制，以更好地控制和调整其行为，适用于实际应用场景。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从Transformer的隐藏状态中提取稀疏线性组合的可解释特征。

Result: SAE提取的特征比原始隐藏状态更具可解释性和单义性，并能灵活控制模型行为。

Conclusion: SAE在序列推荐任务中表现出色，提供了一种有效且直观的方法来调整推荐行为。

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based
on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box
models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their
internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is
very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse
autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for
extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders
learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from
sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential
recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied
to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned
directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original
hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by
SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior,
providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their
recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 通过调整推荐系统的公平性指标，可以在个性化推荐与多样性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 优化推荐系统以兼顾个性化与多样性，有助于避免过滤气泡，促进更包容的内容生态。

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday
experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries
online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of
building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social
media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several
perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the
content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating
the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern
across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes
place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so
tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of
opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's
perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's
perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of
potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are
far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political
decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation
of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?
Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to
represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through
the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation
framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and
the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of
view.

TL;DR: 提出一个生态系统，通过三种语义技术解决本体互操作性问题，并在建筑领域验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体互操作性是知识图谱中复杂且限制本体使用的问题，不同本体的冲突和重叠概念增加了设计与部署的难度。

Method: 在生命周期各阶段采用三种技术：设计阶段用本体设计模式（ODPs），开发阶段用本体匹配与版本化（OM&OV），部署阶段用本体兼容知识图谱（OCKGs）。

Result: 在建筑领域的案例研究验证了该生态系统的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的生态系统能有效提升本体互操作性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Ontology interoperability is one of the complicated issues that restricts the
use of ontologies in knowledge graphs (KGs). Different ontologies with
conflicting and overlapping concepts make it difficult to design, develop, and
deploy an interoperable ontology for downstream tasks. We propose an ecosystem
for ontology interoperability. The ecosystem employs three state-of-the-art
semantic techniques in different phases of the ontology engineering life cycle:
ontology design patterns (ODPs) in the design phase, ontology matching and
versioning (OM\&OV) in the develop phase, and ontology-compliant knowledge
graphs (OCKGs) in the deploy phase, to achieve better ontology interoperability
in real-world applications. A case study in the building domain validates the
usefulness of the proposed ecosystem.

Motivation: 解决传统文本信息提取系统忽略视觉元素的问题，以及多模态LLM在检索效率和计算成本上的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了检索效率，适合企业级应用。

Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only
language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of
information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex
information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle
in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial
number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual
language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based
vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based
multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do
not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires
computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.
Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the
approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval
process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval
process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We
propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search
(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to
retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate
answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we
observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable
(without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production
systems at enterprises.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RUGNN的图神经网络替代模型，用于预测材料成形过程中的变形场，解决了传统AI模型在捕捉3D空间关系和排列不变性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标量或图像的AI替代模型难以捕捉复杂的3D空间关系和排列不变性，因此需要开发更高效的图神经网络模型。

Method: RUGNN结合了门控循环单元（GRU）建模时间动态，以及受U-Net启发的图上下采样机制处理空间长程依赖，并提出了一种新的‘节点到表面’接触表示方法。

Result: RUGNN在冷成形和热成形案例中表现出色，预测结果与真实有限元模拟高度一致，且优于其他基线GNN架构。

Conclusion: RUGNN是一种可靠的方法，能够支持板材成形设计，提供准确的制造性预测。

Abstract: In recent years, various artificial intelligence-based surrogate models have
been proposed to provide rapid manufacturability predictions of material
forming processes. However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically
built with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability
to capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a
permutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based
surrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study
developed a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U
Net-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate
predictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming
timesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model
temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample
mechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'
contact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements
in computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN
model was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot
forming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN
model provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth
FE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures. Model
tuning was also performed to identify suitable hyperparameters, training
strategies, and input feature representations. These results demonstrate that
RUGNN is a reliable approach to support sheet material forming design by
enabling accurate manufacturability predictions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习模型预测脊柱手术的住院时长，重点关注时间序列建模和模型解释性，以支持临床决策。

Method: 比较了传统模型（如线性回归、随机森林、SVM、XGBoost）与SurgeryLSTM（带注意力机制的BiLSTM），使用电子健康记录数据评估性能。

Result: SurgeryLSTM预测准确率最高（R2=0.86），注意力机制提升了模型解释性，识别出关键预测因素如骨病、慢性肾病和腰椎融合术。

Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM是一种高效且可解释的AI解决方案，支持将时间序列模型整合到临床决策中，提升出院准备和个性化护理。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for
predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the
benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and
Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random
forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,
SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an
attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.
Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key
predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved
the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)
and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by
dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative
clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most
contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone
disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most
impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention
mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential
nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher
accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical
adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based
temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM
presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in
elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,
explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance
discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

Conclusion: CMCO为神经算子提供了一种通用、即插即用的不确定性量化方案，推动了科学机器学习的可扩展性和泛化性。

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe
deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in
high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the
norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework
that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,
distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with
split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves
spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or
custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow
operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.
Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,
elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO
consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with
strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a
general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking
real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and
safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal
computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,
generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to
compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity
simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the
\emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein
Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic
differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed
distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural
Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime
geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics
emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential,
including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage
efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges
across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open
source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive
approaches to numerical relativity. Code is made available at

vital solution, especially for tabular datasets, which are central to domains
like finance, healthcare and the social sciences. This survey presents a
comprehensive and focused review of recent advances in synthetic tabular data

goals that drive synthetic data creation, including conditional generation and
risk-sensitive modeling. Additionally, the survey proposes a benchmark

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular
time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.
They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational
social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and
seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant
challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena
using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional
tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders
that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings
support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,
similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised
classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray
astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and
spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our
framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing
complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial
practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep
generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work
addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models
(Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal
Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and
Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our
evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation
of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation
(reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii)
dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific
dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle
conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware
reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring
additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically
calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence,
component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall
performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal
variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics,
and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM
generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在训练过程中表现出的延迟泛化现象（grokking），并开发可预测和解释这一行为的实用指标。

Method: 通过Dropout鲁棒性曲线（DRC）估计模型对噪声的鲁棒性，分析测试精度方差、神经元活跃度和嵌入分布等指标。

Result: 发现测试精度方差在grokking期间出现局部最大值，神经元活跃度增加，嵌入分布趋于双峰且与数据集对称性相关。

Conclusion: 这些指标不仅预测grokking行为，还揭示了其起源和动态特征，为理解神经网络泛化机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test
accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in
training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including
variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity
measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of
neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout
Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the
dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The
variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training
checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally,
the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the
embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that
correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries.
These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and
behaviour of grokking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于零知识证明（ZKP）的联邦学习隐私保护评估协议，避免通过性能指标泄露敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的评估阶段可能通过共享的性能指标泄露敏感信息，需要一种隐私保护且可验证的评估方法。

Method: 使用零知识证明技术，客户端生成简洁证明，表明其本地损失低于预设阈值，无需依赖外部API。

Result: 在MNIST和HAR数据集上验证了方法的有效性，评估了计算开销、通信成本和可验证性。

Conclusion: 提出的协议在保护隐私的同时实现了可验证的联邦学习评估。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak
sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we
propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to
enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of
revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that
their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented
without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated
learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both
the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a
threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
(for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate
the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and
verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术虽能揭示细胞状态，但传统方法将细胞视为独立数据点，忽略了细胞间的动态相互作用。空间转录组学虽能捕捉细胞组织，但仍需计算方法的进步。

Method: STAGED方法结合ABM与深度学习，使用图ODE网络（GDEs）和注意力机制动态学习基因间相互作用。

Result: 模型能匹配模拟和空间转录组数据的连续轨迹，捕捉细胞间和细胞内相互作用。

Conclusion: STAGED方法提供了更自适应和准确的细胞动态表示。

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our
understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under
normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as
clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as
independent data points of population distributions. With spatial
transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic
cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key
computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such
complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM)
provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules
derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address
this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)
integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and
its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE
networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents
genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning
their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match
continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from
spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and
intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate
representation of cellular dynamics.

Motivation: 理解当代大型模型中低层次基元如何组合成功能更丰富的模块，尤其是线性层中的几何基元。

Method: 使用Clifford代数将线性层表示为双向量的组合，并开发了一种可微分算法将其分解为转子的乘积。

Result: 基于转子的层在LLM注意力层中表现与块Hadamard和低秩近似等基线相当，但参数更少（O(log²d) vs O(d²)）。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习模型中几何基元如何组合提供了代数视角，展示了高效参数化的潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of
low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but
these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this
compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize
linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using
Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions
of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a
differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This
construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense
matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention
layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such
as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an
algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into
higher-level functions within deep models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨核心集选择方法是否会延续、放大或缓解数据集中的偏见，以促进数据高效机器学习。

Method: 在十个不同的虚假相关性基准上，结合五种评分指标和五种数据选择策略，分析核心集选择对偏见水平的影响。

Result: 嵌入基评分方法比学习动态基方法更不易加剧偏见，但难样本选择不一定提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 核心集选择方法需谨慎设计以避免偏见放大，且难样本选择并非鲁棒性的可靠保证。

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Motivation: 英国铁路因落叶导致的交通中断每年损失超过3亿英镑，现有预测方法在可扩展性和可靠性上存在不足。

Method: 结合地面真实落叶数据、多光谱和气象卫星数据，训练LSTM网络进行预测。

Result: 模型预测落叶开始和结束时间的均方根误差分别为6.32天和9.31天，优于先前研究。

Conclusion: 该模型为铁路行业优化落叶缓解措施提供了新机会，并有助于理解复杂生态系统。

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail
industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions
are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being
treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the
timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network
operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures.
However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable
limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to
devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and
the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable
insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth
leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data
demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of
leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which
improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for
the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the
improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

<details>

Motivation: 研究在偏好观察而非直接数值损失的环境下，如何优化决策过程，特别是针对Borda分数的场景。

Method: 1. 建立PbMDPs的遗憾下界；2. 提出基于全局优化的算法和策略优化算法。

Result: 1. 证明了遗憾下界为Ω((H²SK)¹/³T²/³)；2. 提出了两种算法，分别达到Õ((H²S²K)¹/³T²/³)和Õ((H⁶SK⁵)¹/³T²/³)的遗憾上界。

Conclusion: 论文为偏好观察的MDPs提供了理论框架和算法，但全局优化方法在计算效率上存在不足，策略优化方法更具实用性。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs
(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the
numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead
observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices
being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the
reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a
regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we
present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for
episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per
episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is
the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret
lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda
scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that
achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global
optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all
occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from
suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and
computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization
algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the
unknown-transition setting.

Result: 在合成和真实世界的分布外场景中验证了FLEX的性能提升能力。

Conclusion: FLEX无需专家知识即可适应不同分布外场景，并通过图数据增强优化链接结构。

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link
prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples
being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models
(GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this,
GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge
this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1)
structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training
between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment
between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert
knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are
conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's
performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the
effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is

Method: 研究了特征转换和目标转换模型在数据漂移下的表现，提出了基于模型和加权实例的时间序列聚类方法，以平衡全局与局部动态。

Result: 实验表明，全局目标转换模型在全局特征和聚类技术的支持下表现优于局部模型，而特征转换模型需依赖聚类技术处理数据异质性。

Conclusion: 全局目标转换模型在负载预测中更具潜力，而特征转换模型需结合聚类技术以优化性能。

Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various
hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of
delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local
forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in
handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.
These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally
expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In
contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance
prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through
globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load
forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of
different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore
feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how
globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In
addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its
potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the
balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series
clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming
models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.
Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity
load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently
outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global
features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming
models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring
TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

Conclusion: 结构感知的特征初始化对发挥GNN潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide
range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often
constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature
representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions.
In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph
encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that
enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework
as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and
supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world
datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For
node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which
concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines.
These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature
initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.

Conclusion: Conformal Prediction与E-SINDy结合能显著提升不确定性量化能力，适用于复杂非线性动力学系统。

Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for
discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying
uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability,
particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty
quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble
approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a
framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees
based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three
applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1)
quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on
library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified
model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three
applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical
systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can
reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting,
effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty
intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to
standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.

Conclusion: GiG框架通过整合不同学习范式和相互作用数据，为DTI预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for
advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine
learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have
difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets
and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and
inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target
interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a
GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and
target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,
enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate
the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug
SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in
its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model
significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,
highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and
interaction data.

Abstract: Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug
discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule
to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a
promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of
conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce
Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample
conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,
using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular
graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples
rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is
able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann
distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for
zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD
simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for
scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot
generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local
structure into the GFlowNet model.

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比激活加法（CAA）在不同规模的Llama 2模型（7B、13B、70B）中的有效性，发现CAA在早期至中期层最有效，但随着模型规模增大效果减弱，且负向引导比正向引导效果更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）复杂性和能力的提升，较少广泛部署的对齐技术效果不确定。本文基于激活引导和对比激活加法（CAA）的先前工作，探索CAA在不同模型规模下的有效性。

Method: 通过对比对（如仇恨到爱）在模型的残差流向量空间中寻找理想方向，并在前向传播时将该方向添加到残差流中，直接操纵残差流以提取特征并控制模型输出。

Result: 1) CAA在早期至中期层最有效；2) CAA效果随模型规模增大而减弱；3) 负向引导在所有模型规模中效果更显著。

Conclusion: CAA在不同规模的Llama 2模型中表现出层依赖性和规模依赖性，负向引导效果更强，为模型对齐技术提供了新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the
efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building
on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition
(CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the
family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable
'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive
pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual
stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and
aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs.
Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found
that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The
effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more
pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays
being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This
research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway
network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological
features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and
neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple
effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,
originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air
network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node
Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,
DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is
to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited
performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the
necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research
contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and
proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for
delays.

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep
generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA
sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent
space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear
shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear
interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the
data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data
representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that
regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders
towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell
count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate
geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances
compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.
Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our
approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data
demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

Result: 在合成和真实噪声的基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLID-MU为噪声标签学习提供了一种有效且不依赖干净数据的方法。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural
networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by
using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this
approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,
which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the
challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean
labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the
need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively
preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and
the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the
Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).
CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature
spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.
Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both
synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

Abstract: Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major
challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have
demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D
molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based
conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable
Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph
diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen
samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical
reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a
dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M
conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional
small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers
competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand
generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a
foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular
generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure
conditioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准数据集（如MNIST）对领域特定任务（如树木或食品分类）不适用，而创建自定义数据集耗时且复杂。MNIST-Gen旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合CLIP语义理解、强化学习和人类反馈，采用分层语义分类和可组合的形态建模，支持多种处理模式。

Result: 生成了Tree-MNIST和Food-MNIST数据集，实现了85%的自动分类准确率和80%的时间节省。

Conclusion: MNIST-Gen为领域特定任务提供了高效、灵活的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited
to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on
domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other
real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant.
Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming,
legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present
MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating
MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using
hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic
understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve
intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical
approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics,
enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes:
individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large
datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category
theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable
morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and
\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing
task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization
accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

TL;DR: HyperEvent提出了一种新的动态链接预测框架，通过识别超事件（hyper-event）来捕捉事件间的结构凝聚力，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉复合超事件的结构凝聚力，限制了动态图建模的准确性。

Method: HyperEvent通过动态构建关联序列和事件相关向量，量化查询事件与历史事件的依赖关系，从而识别超事件。

Result: 在5个数据集中的4个上表现优于现有方法，并在大规模Flight数据集上实现了6.95%的性能提升，同时训练时间仅为10.17%。

Conclusion: HyperEvent在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于大规模动态图的建模。

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs is a fundamental
task for modeling evolving complex systems. Existing node-centric and
event-centric methods focus on individual interactions or atomic states,
failing to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events, groups of
causally related events. To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework
reframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to
HyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event
correlation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the
query event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the
structural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the
occurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a
valid hyper-event with these historical events. Notably, HyperEvent outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on 4 out of 5 datasets in the official leaderboard.
For scalability, we further introduce an efficient parallel training algorithm
that segments large event streams to enable concurrent training. Experiments
validate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency on large-scale graphs.
Among which HyperEvent achieves a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank
over state-of-the-art baseline on the large-scale Flight dataset while
utilizing only 10.17% of the training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物分子结构预测中模型效率与预测精度平衡的挑战。

Method: 1) 用少步ODE采样替换多步AF3采样；2) 剪枝冗余Transformer模块；3) 用ESM模块替代传统MSA模块。

Result: Protenix-Mini在基准数据集上性能仅下降1-5%，计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: Protenix-Mini适合计算资源有限但需高精度预测的应用场景。

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and
inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address
the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making
several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step
ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion
module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a
subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions
to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural
pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is
trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing
time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and
optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This
streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a
two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,
Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.
Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity
predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes
Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources
are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

Motivation: 广义线性赌博机（GLB）因其非线性特性在计算和统计效率之间存在权衡，现有方法难以同时优化两者。

Conclusion: 该方法在广义线性赌博机问题中实现了计算和统计效率的联合优化，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual
multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by
incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of
reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely
applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces
significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical
efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either
incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising
statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we
propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret
bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of
our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD)
estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion
of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator,
even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to
maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient
optimistic method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征归因方法假设特征顺序固定，混淆了特征值与其位置对模型预测的影响，限制了模型解释的准确性。

Method: 引入OrdShap，通过量化特征位置置换对模型预测的影响，分离特征值与位置效应，并基于博弈论与Sanchez-Bergantiños值建立理论联系。

Result: 在健康、自然语言和合成数据集上的实验表明，OrdShap能有效捕捉特征值和位置的影响，提供更深入的模型行为洞察。

Conclusion: OrdShap为理解序列模型的预测提供了更准确的归因方法，尤其适用于需要区分特征值与位置效应的场景。

Abstract: Sequential deep learning models excel in domains with temporal or sequential
dependencies, but their complexity necessitates post-hoc feature attribution
methods for understanding their predictions. While existing techniques quantify
feature importance, they inherently assume fixed feature ordering - conflating
the effects of (1) feature values and (2) their positions within input
sequences. To address this gap, we introduce OrdShap, a novel attribution
method that disentangles these effects by quantifying how a model's predictions
change in response to permuting feature position. We establish a game-theoretic
connection between OrdShap and Sanchez-Berganti\~nos values, providing a
theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical
results from health, natural language, and synthetic datasets highlight
OrdShap's effectiveness in capturing feature value and feature position
attributions, and provide deeper insight into model behavior.

Conclusion: pi-DDPG框架有效解决了动态管理司机参与折扣快车服务的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of platform integration has emerged as an effective
solution to mitigate market fragmentation by consolidating multiple
ride-hailing platforms into a single application. To address heterogeneous
passenger preferences, third-party integrators provide Discount Express service
delivered by express drivers at lower trip fares. For the individual platform,
encouraging broader participation of drivers in Discount Express services has
the potential to expand the accessible demand pool and improve matching
efficiency, but often at the cost of reduced profit margins. This study aims to
dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective
of individual platforms. The lack of historical data under the new business
model necessitates online learning. However, early-stage exploration through
trial and error can be costly in practice, highlighting the need for reliable
early-stage performance in real-world deployment. To address these challenges,
this study formulates the decision regarding the proportion of drivers'
acceptance behavior as a continuous control task. In response to the high
stochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party
integrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a
policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The
proposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance
during the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term
memory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and
adopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning
efficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces
early-stage training losses.

Conclusion: Meta-IR通过元学习有效解决了不平衡回归问题，展示了重采样策略与学习模型之间的内在关系。

Abstract: Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are
extensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present
challenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A
common alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to
address dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods
and learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many
combinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric
affect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced
Regression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by
training meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the
resampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The
meta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map
the meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two
formulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers
to separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy.
Chained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier
is used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The
Chained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between
the learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with
AutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with
baselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no
resampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of
them. The code, data, and further information of the experiments can be found

Abstract: Imbalanced problems can arise in different real-world situations, and to
address this, certain strategies in the form of resampling or balancing
algorithms are proposed. This issue has largely been studied in the context of
classification, and yet, the same problem features in regression tasks, where
target values are continuous. This work presents an extensive experimental
study comprising various balancing and predictive models, and wich uses metrics
to capture important elements for the user and to evaluate the predictive model
in an imbalanced regression data context. It also proposes a taxonomy for
imbalanced regression approaches based on three crucial criteria: regression
model, learning process, and evaluation metrics. The study offers new insights
into the use of such strategies, highlighting the advantages they bring to each
model's learning process, and indicating directions for further studies. The

Conclusion: 结论是可复现探索并不比批量学习更昂贵，样本高效的RL是可实现的，填补了理论与实际之间的差距。

Abstract: The epidemic failure of replicability across empirical science and machine
learning has recently motivated the formal study of replicable learning
algorithms [Impagliazzo et al. (2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from
a fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the
design of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.
In contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control
settings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with
a shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative
model of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch
setting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only
$\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a
generative model jumps to $\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the
substantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key
question in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration
inherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable
RL even possible?
  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular
MDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our
main result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging
the gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a
matching $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under
the common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in
the episodic setting of $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of
our algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-accelerated optimization framework for
RF power amplifier design that reduces simulation requirements by 65% while
maintaining $\pm0.3$ to $\pm0.4$ dBm accuracy. The proposed method combines
MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting to
intelligently explore multidimensional parameter spaces. Instead of
exhaustively simulating all parameter combinations to achieve target P2dB
compression specifications, our approach strategically selects approximately
35% of critical simulation points. The framework processes ADS netlists,
executes harmonic balance simulations on the reduced dataset, and trains a
CatBoost model to predict P2dB performance across the entire design space.
Validation across 15 PA operating modes yields an average $R^2$ of 0.901, with
the system ranking parameter combinations by their likelihood of meeting target
specifications. The integrated solution delivers 58.24% to 77.78% reduction in
simulation time through automated GUI-based workflows, enabling rapid design
iterations without compromising accuracy standards required for production RF

Conclusion: 多轮强化学习在CUDA内核优化中表现优异，尤其是串行细化比并行采样更有效。

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems'
efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve
performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable
rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of
this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that
addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as
learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns.
We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL
for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin
shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of
generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to
1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini
(0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found
scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In
particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of
improvement.

successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Motivation: 现有图欺诈检测方法忽略原始文本信息中的丰富语义线索，且难以将LLM处理的文本嵌入与图结构进行多模态融合。

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within
multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use
preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal
fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual
information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful
capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant
challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with
graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM
\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In
MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to
enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure
information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a
multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and
relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the
fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of
the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world
datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud
detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Social interactions play a crucial role in shaping human behavior,
relationships, and societies. It encompasses various forms of communication,
such as verbal conversation, non-verbal gestures, facial expressions, and body
language. In this work, we develop a novel computational approach to detect a
foundational aspect of human social interactions, in-person verbal
conversations, by leveraging audio and inertial data captured with a commodity
smartwatch in acoustically-challenging scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we
conducted a lab study with 11 participants and a semi-naturalistic study with
24 participants. We analyzed machine learning and deep learning models with 3
different fusion methods, showing the advantages of fusing audio and inertial
data to consider not only verbal cues but also non-verbal gestures in
conversations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive set of evaluations
across activities and sampling rates to demonstrate the benefits of multimodal
sensing in specific contexts. Overall, our framework achieved 82.0$\pm$3.0%
macro F1-score when detecting conversations in the lab and 77.2$\pm$1.8% in the
semi-naturalistic setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DUSE的数据扩展框架，通过不确定性评分函数和主动学习策略解决自动调制识别中数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在自动调制识别中表现优异，但需要大量标注数据。实际场景中目标域数据稀缺，手动收集或数据增强方法无法根本解决问题。

Method: DUSE框架利用不确定性评分函数从相关数据集中筛选有用样本，并通过主动学习策略持续优化评分器。

Result: 实验表明，DUSE在类别平衡和不平衡设置下均优于8种核心集选择基线方法，并展现出对未见模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUSE有效解决了数据稀缺问题，为自动调制识别提供了高效的数据扩展方案。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field
of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large
amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the
available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model
training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert
annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common
method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a
certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot
fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges,
we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven
Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring
function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an
active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection
baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE
exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在有限个体反馈下如何更准确地预测群体反馈分布，发现随着反馈粒度的增加，复杂方法比正则化平均更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在成本限制下，利用少量个体反馈更准确地预测群体反馈分布，尤其是在高粒度反馈场景中。

Method: 比较正则化平均与更复杂的方法在不同反馈粒度（如二值和五点反馈）下的表现。

Result: 五点反馈下，复杂方法仅需正则化平均一半的个体数量即可达到相同性能，而二值反馈下改进有限。

Conclusion: 反馈粒度越高，复杂方法在预测群体分布时的优势越明显。

Abstract: Human feedback is increasingly used across diverse applications like training
AI models, developing recommender systems, and measuring public opinion -- with
granular feedback often being preferred over binary feedback for its greater
informativeness. While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's
distribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,
cost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to
approximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the
empirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As
we will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.
  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using
feedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback
granularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of
regularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more
sophisticated than regularized averaging.
  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this
pattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the
number of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By
contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance
of regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.

Motivation: 持续学习（CL）在避免灾难性遗忘的同时从顺序任务中获取知识，但现有方法缺乏理论支持，尤其是基于回放的方法。

Method: 通过信息论边界，分析了记忆缓冲区与当前任务的交互对泛化的影响，并提出基于假设和预测的边界。

Result: 研究表明，有限回放与当前任务数据结合能改善泛化并减少遗忘，且预测边界提供了更紧致的泛化差距上界。

Conclusion: 该理论框架广泛适用于多种学习算法，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring
knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical
performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior
remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a
series of information-theoretic bounds that explicitly characterize how the
memory buffer interacts with the current task to affect generalization.
Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds reveal that utilizing the limited
exemplars of previous tasks alongside the current task data, rather than
exhaustive replay, facilitates improved generalization while effectively
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our prediction-based bounds
yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds of the generalization
gap through the use of low-dimensional variables. Our analysis is general and
broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL
settings.

Motivation: 城市规划和交通优化需要模拟人类出行模式，但现有方法依赖历史数据或假设静态场景，无法适应动态变化。

Method: 结合动态区域大小和土地利用类型，利用条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）融合历史数据与动态参数。

Result: 在新加坡手机数据上验证了方法的有效性，并与现有方法进行了对比。

Conclusion: 该方法无需复杂校准或行为建模，能快速生成可调整空间粒度的出行流量。

Abstract: The mobility patterns of people in cities evolve alongside changes in land
use and population. This makes it crucial for urban planners to simulate and
analyze human mobility patterns for purposes such as transportation
optimization and sustainable urban development. Existing generative models
borrowed from machine learning rely heavily on historical trajectories and
often overlook evolving factors like changes in population density and land
use. Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility
distribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future
projections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study
introduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination
mobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages
adaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it
utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend
historical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid
mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions
of interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior
modeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its
application to mobile phone data from Singapore, and by its comparison with
existing methods.

Method: 使用新工具对自编码器模型进行消融研究，仅改变激活函数，分析离散和连续代数对称性对表征的影响。

Result: 发现离散代数置换等变对称性导致表征离散化，而连续代数正交等变定义下表征保持连续。量化表征与重建误差增加相关。

Conclusion: 功能形式选择可能引入任务无关的表征结构，离散表征的形成机制为下游可解释性现象提供了基础。新工具为涌现可解释性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational
alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this,
it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong
predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this
new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and
arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the
activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise
when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic
permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a
continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings
corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended
inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in
representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of
otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this
supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations
may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability
phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general
linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed
mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide
several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary
results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with
a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures
that this collapse can be detrimental.

Result: 该度量方法满足完备性和可靠性，且可在仅预测访问设置中高效估计。

Conclusion: 信息差距框架不仅推广了现有概念，还为比较预测模型提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: In many applications, decision-makers must choose between multiple predictive
models that may all be miscalibrated. Which model (i.e., predictor) is more
"useful" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution
introduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors,
defined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over
the other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes
several existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration
Decision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its
calibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,
Bla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our
second contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap,
which gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a
relaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction
distributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is
complete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the
prediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel
combinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly
calibrated predictors.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在未标记数据集上接近完美准确性，并对恶意攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 联邦学习频谱感知（FLSS）在解决频谱稀缺和安全性问题上表现出色。

Abstract: Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and
the envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However,
this rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical
challenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and
dynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address
this issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for
improving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems
is limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory
challenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such
as Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses
two key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of
labeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is
tackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection,
enabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security
vulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our
analysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in
countering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel
defense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data
poisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions,
demonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets
and maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data
poisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are
malicious.

Result: 在LLM和扩散模型上，RiemannLoRA比标准LoRA及其改进版本表现更优。

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA为LoRA提供了一种高效且稳定的优化框架，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable,
geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting.
The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model
the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in
stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3
delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble
models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8
to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches,
FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains
realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these
advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture
tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on
1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-
and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical
numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a
single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly
resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range
probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal
timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting
and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range
of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but
pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing
interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing
foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a
communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer
inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation
to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial

simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently
compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly
address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component
Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian
Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design
choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer
representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically,
our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula
dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships,
demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly
enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results

Conclusion: UrbanRadio3D和RadioDiff-3D为3D环境感知通信研究提供了基础数据集和基准。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling
environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial
distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM
construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely
on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as
direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial
variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static
learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data
distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a
large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in
realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than
previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA,
forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than
prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet
with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce
RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D
convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware
scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based
on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate
that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich,
high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work
provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D
environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised classification is a fundamental machine learning problem.
Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and
imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential
clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This
paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering
results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our
analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and
sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers.
Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to
accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable
the representation of "tolerable" mistakes, leading to the definition of
evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers
tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative
Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable
and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We
validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into
account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an
explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time.

*Nikolaos Louloudakis,Ajitha Rajan*

TL;DR: TuneQn是一个工具套件，支持选择性量化、部署和执行ONNX模型，通过多目标优化和性能分析，显著减少精度损失和模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全量化模型可能导致性能下降和部署困难，因此需要选择性量化，但如何选择量化层是一个挑战。

Method: 提出TuneQn，结合性能分析和多目标优化，生成选择性量化的ONNX模型，并在不同硬件上评估其性能。

Result: 在四种ONNX模型上测试，TuneQn减少精度损失达54.14%，模型大小减少达72.9%。

Conclusion: TuneQn能有效实现选择性量化和优化，提升模型性能和部署效率。

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network
models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of
accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance
below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware
accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,
quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but
selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose
TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of
ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and
multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX
models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics
like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best
model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings
across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility
effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model
candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the
fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the
original model.

Result: 结果表明，数学正则化在贝叶斯框架下表现更优。

Conclusion: PILM为线性正反问题、欠定系统和物理正则化提供了可解析求解的框架。

Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary
conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding
the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as
physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by
minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained
significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we
investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear
combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an
analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and
verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with
uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain
rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces
elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical
regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian
perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The
PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward
and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度神经网络（DNNs）优化器的角色不仅是加速收敛，还影响学习解的性质，呼吁社区关注优化器设计的潜在偏差和表达性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期对DNNs可行性的怀疑源于其非线性特性导致无法保证收敛到全局最优解。尽管实践证明了DNNs的成功，但优化器的设计仍过于关注效率，忽视了其对学习解性质的影响。

Method: 通过分析现有优化器的行为，提出优化器不仅影响收敛速度，还通过引入归纳偏差改变模型的有效表达能力。

Result: 优化器可以编码学习过程中的期望属性，而不仅仅是加速收敛。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区更深入地理解优化器的偏差，并设计具有明确目标的新优化器，以补充架构和数据在模型结果中的作用。

Abstract: Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not
guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using
optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a
primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early
days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed
this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows
that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit
well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This
success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model
for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of
required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We
argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another
perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the
optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative
properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will
encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class
of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of
encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community
should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as
aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain
properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their
convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our
understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we
converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a
critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping
model outcomes.

Result: LEOPARD在经典自然语言处理基准上实现了最先进的离散属性非线性擦除性能，并有效减少了深度非线性分类器的偏见。

Conclusion: LEOPARD方法在移除敏感信息和促进公平性方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Conclusion: 该方法通过幂律谱特征有效提升了因果发现的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet
crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics,
neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD)
have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise,
resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this
paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series
follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing
behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the
extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals.
Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures,
demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

Conclusion: 该方法灵活、可扩展，并能有效恢复非平稳参数，适用于复杂数据集。

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression
because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they
often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and
may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses
nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling
these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as
input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the
chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior
of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods
for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different
nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure.
Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily
modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on
several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and
log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated
with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only
nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover
the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法多为特定领域设计，跨领域使用时性能下降，导致灾难性遗忘问题，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: RegCL通过合并不同领域的SAM适配模块（如LoRA模块）参数，利用权重优化指导合并过程，最小化预测差异。

Result: 实验表明，RegCL在多个下游数据集上实现了良好的持续学习性能，验证了其在动态场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: RegCL通过模型合并有效整合多领域知识，保持参数效率，无需历史数据存储，解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了性能与复杂度，代码已开源。

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

Result: TP显著提升了模型对CoTA攻击的抵抗力，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: TP为下一代AI架构提供了首个全面的CoTA防御机制，实现了安全与功能的平衡。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,
Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large
Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains
a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like
backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning
mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this
vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously
degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To
address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought
Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to
malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves
this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data
processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)
adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive
defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement
learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the
security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法为拓扑深度学习提供了高效且表达能力强的表示，为分子分类和性质预测任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph
neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing,
which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a
novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on
combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels
that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information
and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration
into modern transformer-based architectures.
  Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can
distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly
outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency.
Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art
descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in
distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on
topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning
by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up
exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.

Result: 样本复杂度降至O(SA log A)，实验验证了显著改进。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种更高效的PAC-MDP算法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this study, we derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds on the
asymptotic sample-complexity for RL within the infinite-horizon Markov Decision
Process (MDP) setting that are sharper than those in existing literature. The
premise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each
other, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when
learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of
'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\epsilon$-optimal
value of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the
$\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of
transitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity
have values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number
of samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs
constructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce
the sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \log A)$ timesteps,
where $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend
these results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a
PAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with
showing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against
prior work in an experimental setting.

Result: 实验显示该方法在WDBC数据库上达到96%准确率，对设备变异和对抗攻击表现出色。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升AI可信度和效率的专用硬件设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns
regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and
robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in
interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains
computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.
Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable
memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement
sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which
leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$
Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient
inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference
experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional
robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays
achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,
while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model
validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device
threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision
trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's
trustworthiness and efficiency.

Method: 通过理论分析验证器的ROC曲线几何特性，比较拒绝采样和BoN方法的性能差异，并在GSM8K数据集上使用不同版本的Llama和Qwen模型进行实验验证。

Result: 拒绝采样在固定计算量下优于BoN，但在无限计算量下两者性能趋同，且性能由ROC曲线在原点附近的斜率决定。

Conclusion: 验证器的ROC曲线几何特性对测试时扩展方法的性能有决定性影响，拒绝采样和BoN在不同计算条件下的表现差异显著。

Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging
additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied
techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a
verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding
of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this
gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is
precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.
Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC
curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve
for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to
extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute
regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed
compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level
of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different

### [135] [NOCTA: Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition for Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12412)
*Dzung Dinh,Boqi Chen,Marc Niethammer,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOCTA是一种非贪婪目标成本权衡获取方法，用于在推理时动态获取最具信息量的特征，同时考虑时间动态和获取成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的应用中（如医疗），需要动态获取最具信息量的特征，同时权衡成本和时间。

Method: 提出NOCTA方法，包括非参数（NOCTA-NP）和参数（NOCTA-P）两种互补的估计器。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上，NOCTA优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NOCTA能有效解决动态特征获取问题，并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of
information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in
healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to
imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be
acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover,
temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over
time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is
important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff
Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at
inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition
cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,
and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based
on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric
method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).
Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both
NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

*Andrea Perin,Giacomo Lagomarsini,Claudio Gallicchio,Giuseppe Nuti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态选择专家序列的混合专家架构，支持可变计算深度和宽度，提升准确率的同时减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家架构通常需要固定计算量，限制了模型的灵活性和效率。

Method: 通过迭代采样候选专家序列，类似RNN训练方式，无需负载平衡机制。

Result: 实验显示训练周期减少10%至40%，准确率相当或更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为混合专家领域提供了新的研究方向，可能设计出更快、表达能力更强的模型。

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts
(MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing
computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures
generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our
approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the
computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by
iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence
akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require
load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in
training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These
results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the
design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available

*Yi Li,David Mccoy,Nolan Gunter,Kaitlyn Lee,Alejandro Schuler,Mark van der Laan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA)框架，将TMLE直接嵌入神经网络参数空间，解决因果推断中的偏差问题，适用于多参数目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络在预测方面强大，但在因果参数（如处理效应或生存曲线）的推断上缺乏有效性。现有方法要么依赖不保证效率的损失函数，要么计算成本高。

Method: TDA通过分区模型参数，冻结大部分参数，仅更新小部分“目标”参数，沿目标梯度迭代更新，消除一阶偏差，生成渐近有效的置信区间。

Result: 在IHDP数据集和模拟生存数据上，TDA减少了偏差并提高了覆盖率，优于标准神经网络估计器和现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: TDA为复杂多参数目标的深度架构提供了一种直接、可扩展的严格因果推断路径。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack
valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire
survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,
existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not
guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally
expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose
Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly
into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone
architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but
a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting
gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the
gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in
estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid
confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal
estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting
gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits
classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric
efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment
effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces
bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators
and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable
pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for
complex multi-parameter targets.

*Daniel Commey,Rebecca A. Sarpong,Griffith S. Klogo,Winful Bagyl-Bac,Garth V. Crosby*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的贝叶斯激励机制，通过经济手段主动防御联邦学习中的数据投毒攻击，确保恶意行为在经济上不理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的开放参与性使其容易受到数据投毒攻击，现有防御方法多为被动且计算成本高，且假设多数参与者诚实。

Method: 设计了一个贝叶斯博弈模型，服务器使用小型验证数据集验证更新质量后支付报酬，满足个体理性（IR）和激励相容性（IC）。

Result: 在非独立同分布的MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上，即使50%的标签翻转攻击下，机制仍保持96.7%的准确率，显著优于标准FedAvg。

Conclusion: 该机制计算轻量、预算可控，易于集成到现有联邦学习框架中，为构建经济稳健的联邦学习生态系统提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its
open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which
malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model.
Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules
that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest
majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight
Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically
irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete
information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private
validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design
satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their
participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning
an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions
of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping
adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3
percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries.
This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which
collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light,
budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a
practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本感知的贝叶斯优化停止规则，无需启发式调参，适用于不同评估成本，并在理论和实验中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在贝叶斯优化中，如何在高成本的黑盒函数评估中适时停止是一个实际问题，现有方法缺乏成本保证。

Method: 基于Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI)和log expected improvement per cost两种成本感知获取函数，提出了一种停止规则。

Result: 理论证明该规则能限制累积评估成本，实验显示其与PBGI结合在成本调整简单遗憾指标上表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的停止规则在成本感知场景下优于其他方法，平衡了解质量与评估成本。

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications
of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box
functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive
stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack
guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation
costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that
adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is
grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition
functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected
improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected
cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these
two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks,
including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we
show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function
consistently matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule
pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs
between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

Main category: cs.SC

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级运行时监控框架，用于实时验证神经证书的安全性，避免传统静态验证的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形式验证方法在验证神经证书（如屏障函数）时面临状态空间探索的可扩展性挑战。

Method: 设计了一个运行时监控框架，通过实时观察系统并在有限预测范围内动态验证证书条件。

Result: 在ReLU控制屏障函数的案例中验证了该框架的实用性，能够及时检测安全违规和错误证书。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经证书的验证提供了一种轻量级且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems
control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as
barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,
serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal
verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability
challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this
challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that
integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying
control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs
on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure
safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for
ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical
effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety
violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an
effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the
certificates.

Main category: cs.SC

TL;DR: FactorHD是一种新型的高维计算模型，能够高效表示和分解复杂的类-子类关系，显著提升计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高维计算模型在表示复杂的类-子类关系时面临挑战，尤其是分解任务。

Method: FactorHD采用符号编码方法嵌入额外记忆子句，并设计高效分解算法选择性消除冗余类。

Result: FactorHD在表示规模为10^9时速度提升约5667倍，与ResNet-18结合在Cifar-10数据集上达到92.48%的分解准确率。

Conclusion: FactorHD克服了现有模型的局限性，为神经符号AI系统提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical
analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising
brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various
HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class
relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,
where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,
they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI
systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of
representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.
FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization
clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it
employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates
redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.
Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in
representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,
overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition
catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves
approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to
existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,
FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型的安全防护措施存在漏洞，研究旨在揭示这些漏洞并提出警告。

Method: 采用jailbreak-tuning方法，通过微调模型使其绕过安全限制。

Result: 实验表明，OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的模型均能被成功绕过，生成有害内容。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发防篡改的安全措施，并警告发布可微调模型的风险。

Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers
broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However,
this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed
fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work
which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal
of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches
models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful
requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply
with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal
activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but
also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more
effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in
the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent
ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,
underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such
safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release
of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally
capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its
capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving

injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch

Abstract: This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the
documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice
based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally
low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and
an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low
quality of ML-documentation. Existing standards are not regularly adopted in
practice and IT-security aspects are often not included in documentation. Due
to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in
ML, as one step towards addressing the existing gaps in ML-security. To achieve
this, we propose expanding existing documentation standards for
ML-documentation to include a security section with specific security relevant
information. Implementing this, a novel expanded method of documenting security
requirements in ML-documentation is presented, based on the existing Model
Cards and Datasheets for Datasets standards, but with the recommendation to
adopt these findings in all ML-documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务中带硬约束的向量搜索（如推荐带标签的视频）面临现有图搜索方法效率低下的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出构建多个索引，每个索引服务于不同形式的谓词，并通过三维分析模型优化索引构建和选择。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多索引和分析模型有效解决了带硬约束的向量搜索问题，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Many real-world tasks such as recommending videos with the kids tag can be
reduced to finding most similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This
task, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art
graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when
hard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered
similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most
similar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works
propose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy
predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide
range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose
efficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.
  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build
many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective
construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing
relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a
workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a
collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to
discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show
superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and
forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1%
build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW
graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在处理长上下文输入时存在二次复杂度和高内存需求的问题，需要更高效的架构如SSM来满足本地设备的需求。

Method: 通过系统性的性能对比测试，评估了Transformer、SSM和混合模型在消费级和嵌入式GPU上的表现。

Result: SSM在长序列处理上表现更优，能处理220K tokens，比Transformer快4倍；Transformer在短序列上更快。

Conclusion: SSM是长上下文推理的高效选择，未来硬件优化应关注SSM内核。

Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous,
long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic
complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures
make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a
paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and
hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses
on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic
performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically
needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of
carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for
long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that
SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing
sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than
comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short
sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x
faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals
that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime,
accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a
primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed,
device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the
edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization
framework.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for
knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has
emerged as an important computational problem with applications in
probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This
has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While
substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development
of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of
disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected
propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative
characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring
that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows
SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.
Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate
that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with
large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid
counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to
achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive
programs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we present enhanced analysis for sign-based optimization
algorithms with momentum updates. Traditional sign-based methods, under the
separable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume
unimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we
demonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate
using constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under
the standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior
momentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$
is the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with
majority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based
method yields convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} +
dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4},

### [151] [Fragment size density estimator for shrinkage-induced fracture based on a physics-informed neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11799)
*Shin-ichi Ito*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的求解器，用于解决收缩诱导碎裂的积分微分方程，避免了传统数值求解的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解方法计算成本高，需要更高效且准确的方法来模拟碎裂过程。

Method: 使用神经网络直接映射输入参数到概率密度函数，无需数值求解控制方程。

Result: 在合成数据上验证了方法的计算效率和预测可靠性，准确性优于传统有限差分法。

Conclusion: 为数据驱动的碎裂逆分析奠定了基础，并展示了框架扩展潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an
integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The
proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability
density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby
significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient
evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining
accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference
schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's
computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a
foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests
the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model
structures.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将开放无线接入网络（ORAN）与非地面网络（NTN）结合的框架，以解决NTN在开发和运维（DevOps）生命周期中的挑战，并提升网络管理的智能化和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中，NTN和ORAN的结合潜力巨大，但缺乏全面的DevOps生命周期解决方案，尤其是如何利用ORAN的智能性解决NTN的可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出了基于ORAN的NTN框架，详细讨论了灵活的前传分割、增强的RAN智能控制器（RICs）、可扩展部署架构和多域服务管理等特性。

Result: 框架展示了ORAN如何通过智能化和开放性提升NTN的效率和可靠性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: ORAN与NTN的结合为6G网络提供了高效、灵活和智能的解决方案，未来需进一步探索与其他技术的结合及实际应用场景。

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications
have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient,
reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures,
the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have
received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the
deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves
the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN
present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,
hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native
artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in
disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works
propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN
deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a
holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps
lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses
the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first
provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the
state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges
that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based
NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These
include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent
controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment
architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research
directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other
enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are
highlighted.

*Rajdeep Mondal,Nikolaj Bjorner,Todd Millstein,Alan Tang,George Varghese*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在程序合成中的用户意图模糊问题，提出了一种原型系统Clarify，通过Disambiguator模块帮助明确用户意图，并在小规模合成工作负载上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在增量配置合成（如路由映射和ACL）中因用户意图模糊导致的优先级推断问题。

Method: 提出原型系统Clarify，结合LLM和Disambiguator模块，通过用户交互明确意图，并验证合成策略。

Result: 在大型云环境中测量到复杂ACL存在数百次重叠，验证了模糊问题的实际存在；Clarify在小规模工作负载上成功合成路由策略。

Conclusion: Clarify通过明确用户意图解决了LLM合成中的模糊问题，其方法适用于其他需要明确更新意图的场景。

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is
ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking
context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and
ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative
priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.
Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,
showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,
which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps
elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally
synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our
treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates
can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and
can lead to different global behaviors.

Main category: physics.data-an

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经网络、特征重要性分析和符号回归的两阶段框架，用于发现氧化物钙钛矿中氧析出反应（OER）活性的可解释描述符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和预测氧化物钙钛矿催化剂的OER活性需要既准确又物理可解释的描述符，而符号回归在高维输入和小数据集时性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段用小数据集和七个结构特征改进已知描述符；第二阶段扩展到164个特征，降维并识别关键电子描述符。

Result: 最终公式结合了改进的结构描述符和电子描述符，提高了准确性（训练和验证MAE分别为22.1和20.6 meV），同时保持物理可解释性。

Conclusion: 神经网络引导的符号回归在数据稀缺情况下仍能发现准确且可解释的描述符，表明可解释性不必以牺牲准确性为代价。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate
and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to
discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs
and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural
networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to
discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In
Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and
improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and
applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8
and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce
dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A
final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved
accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong
physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic
regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful
descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need
not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.

TL;DR: MetaLint是一个基于指令调整的框架，用于代码质量分析，能够适应新代码模式而无需重新训练，显著提升了对未见过代码习惯的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但在代码质量分析上受限于静态训练数据，难以适应不断变化的最佳实践。

Method: MetaLint通过指令调整在合成的linter生成数据上进行训练，支持从易到难的泛化，无需重新训练即可适应新代码模式。

Result: MetaLint在未见的PEP习惯检测中达到70.37%的F分数和70.43%的召回率，定位任务中表现也优于同类模型。

Conclusion: MetaLint展示了在代码质量分析中的潜力，能够适应未来需求，性能与更大规模的模型相当。

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with
code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and
can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new
instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the
task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms
based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train
models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on
synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization,
enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining.
To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by
real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and
assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize.
Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms,
achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%)
among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization,
competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art
models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality
analysis.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注自然语言任务，忽视了代码质量和实际性能，导致对LLM在生产环境中真实能力和风险的理解不足。

Method: 提出MERA Code基准，包含11个评估任务，覆盖8种编程语言，并提供开源代码库、评分系统和平台。

Result: 评估了开源LLM和前沿API模型，分析了其在非英语语言中实际编码任务的局限性。

Conclusion: 公开发布MERA Code以指导未来研究，推动模型开发的突破性功能，并标准化评估流程。

Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering;
however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks,
overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over
executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true
capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address
this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,
specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in
Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming
languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that
outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these
tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct
MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming
environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We
evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in
terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly
releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in
model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动化方法，将静态HTML定价转换为智能定价（iPricing），以提高SaaS定价管理的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SaaS市场的快速扩张导致定价管理复杂化，缺乏自动化工具限制了定价模型的评估和优化能力。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的AI4Pricing2Yaml系统，结合网络爬虫和LLM技术，从SaaS网站提取定价信息。

Result: 验证表明系统能有效提取30个商业SaaS的150多个智能定价元素，但仍面临幻觉和动态内容等挑战。

Conclusion: 自动化智能定价转换有望简化SaaS定价管理，未来研究将优化提取能力和系统适应性。

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering
flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid
expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps
teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that
is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for
pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and
scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing
(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these
challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines
operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in
response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We
present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML
pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while
minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic
Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract
essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from
SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,
encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's
effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,
challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic
content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing
transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for
improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing
landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and
enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.

Motivation: 解决软件库快速演变对代码生成的挑战，现有基准缺乏基于执行的评估。

Method: 引入GitChameleon数据集，包含328个Python代码完成问题，每个问题绑定特定库版本并附带可执行单元测试。

Result: 当前最先进模型在此任务上表现不佳，企业模型基线成功率仅为48-51%。

Conclusion: GitChameleon为动态代码库的挑战提供了执行基准，有助于开发更可靠的AI代码生成方法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for
code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version
updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution
benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based
evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To
address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset
comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific
library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon
rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),
LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform
version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy
through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art
systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models
achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the
intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing
the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer
understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more
adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and
evaluation code publicly available at

Motivation: 解决高速公路匝道合并区域的交通拥堵和事故问题，尤其是在CAV未完全普及的情况下，需要一种适应混合交通流的控制策略。

Method: 扩展了基于智能驾驶员模型的纵向跟车模型和五次多项式曲线的横向换道模型，提出HCOMC框架，包含分层协作规划、博弈论换道模型和多目标优化算法。

Result: 仿真表明HCOMC在提升车辆群安全性、稳定合并过程、优化交通效率和节省燃油方面优于基准方法。

Conclusion: HCOMC为混合交通流下的匝道合并提供了高效、安全的解决方案，具有显著的综合优势。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

Motivation: 高风险交通区域（如交叉路口）是碰撞的主要原因，需提升自动驾驶车辆在此类场景的安全性。

Method: 训练1000步去噪扩散概率模型生成碰撞传感器噪声序列，并通过生成对抗架构将其蒸馏为单步模型，用于快速推理。

Result: 单步模型在保持采样质量的同时实现快速推理，应用于规划器后显著降低失败率和延迟率。

Conclusion: 单步去噪扩散模型能高效生成潜在碰撞场景，为自动驾驶车辆提供更安全的决策支持。

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid

ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

TL;DR: Inversion-DPO是一种新的对齐框架，通过DDIM反演优化扩散模型，避免了奖励建模，提高了训练效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法需要计算密集型训练，可能导致模型准确性和效率下降。

Method: 利用DDIM反演重新制定Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)，消除辅助奖励模型的需求。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中表现优异，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型的高效、高精度对齐提供了新途径，适用于复杂生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一种新框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的挑战，包括时间建模能力不足和模态差异，并通过双分支架构和专用重编程阶段显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现优异，但在时空预测中，大型语言模型（LLMs）难以捕捉丰富的时空相关性。因此，需要一种新方法来利用视觉基础模型（VFMs）的优势。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM重编程阶段处理这些输入，以增强时空建模能力。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线，展示了其在不同VFM主干上的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，能够有效利用视觉基础模型进行时空预测，解决了时间建模和模态差异的关键挑战。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

TL;DR: xOp-GAN是一种新型GAN模型，通过多个专家生成器网络解决水下图像恢复问题，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，最终由判别器选择最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN方法在复杂水下图像恢复任务中表现不佳，因为单一生成器难以覆盖所有视觉退化情况。

Method: 提出xOp-GAN模型，包含多个专家生成器，每个生成器针对特定质量范围的图像进行训练，判别器在推理阶段选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单一回归模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器架构和判别器选择机制，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

Motivation: 野生猫对澳大利亚野生动物造成严重威胁，需要高效监控技术以减少其影响。

Method: 改进PPGNet模型（原用于阿穆尔虎重识别）为PPGNet-Cat，并探索对比学习方法如ArcFace损失。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，mAP达0.86，rank-1准确率为0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat是一种高效的野生猫重识别模型，适用于监控工作。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Motivation: 传统基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，VAE通过重构图像直接编码视觉特征，生成更可解释的潜在空间。

Method: 提出VAE-MLP模型，利用VAE作为特征编码器，应用于168例未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集。

Result: 模型在MRI数据集上表现优异，交叉验证指标为AUC 0.86、敏感性0.79、特异性0.85。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP在LNM分期中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR方法难以应对，而新兴VLMs可能提供更优解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B等VLMs与PaddleOCRv4在公开数据集（ICDAR 2015和SVT）上的表现，并加入合成天气干扰。

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在边缘部署中更具优势，同时公开了天气增强的基准数据集和评估代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

Result: 实验表明，UCGS通过多任务训练，能够在多种AVR任务中展示抽象推理能力，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: UCGS提供了一种统一的框架，能够高效解决多种AVR任务，并展示了零样本推理的潜力。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上显著提升识别性能，尤其在模糊或不平衡情感类别中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: GRACE通过细粒度跨模态对齐，有效解决了DFER中的关键问题。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征到低频以避免下采样时的失真，并在上采样时恢复高频信息，显著提升语义分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息（如纹理）对语义分割至关重要，但在下采样过程中容易因混叠或失真而丢失。

Method: 通过自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征到低频，设计多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）恢复高频信息。

Result: 有效减轻混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务（分类、对抗鲁棒性、实例分割等）。

Conclusion: SFM方法通用且高效，可无缝集成到多种架构中。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是生成考虑实例关系和属性的多实例图像的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,

addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，需要一种方法来动态调制频率响应。

Method: 提出FDAM，包含Attention Inversion（AttInv）和Frequency Dynamic Scaling（FreqScale）两种技术，分别生成互补的高通滤波和动态加权不同频率分量。

Result: 在多种模型（如SegFormer、DeiT、MaskDINO）和任务（语义分割、目标检测、实例分割）中表现提升，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效解决了ViTs的频率消失问题，显著提升了性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取和表示学习中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建视为稀疏信号重建问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码强制预测一致性，实现端到端的域泛化。

Result: 在自然和生物图像分割任务中，MaskTwins优于基线方法，无需单独预训练即可提取域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为域自适应分割提供了新范式，展示了掩码重建在特征提取中的显著优势。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其内部多个子域（如白天、夜晚、雾天场景），解耦域不变（DI）和域特定（DS）特征对RGB-IR域适应有益。

Method: 设计了光谱自适应幂等解耦（SAID）模块，通过基于滤波器组的光谱处理范式和自蒸馏驱动的解耦损失实现DI和DS的准确解耦；提出空间-光谱耦合方法，实现DI特征的联合耦合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了基线性能，并在多个RGB-IR数据集上优于现有UDAOD方法，包括基于FLIR-ADAS数据集的新实验协议。

Conclusion: 通过解耦-耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效解决了RGB-IR域适应问题，为多子域场景下的目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IICMVNCD的新框架，首次在多视图数据中探索新类发现（NCD），解决了现有方法对单视图数据的依赖和伪标签不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCD方法主要针对单视图数据且依赖伪标签，导致性能不稳定，无法适应多视图数据（如多组学数据）的需求。

Method: 通过矩阵分解将特征分解为视图共享的基础矩阵和因子矩阵，利用已知类别的视图关系指导新类别的聚类，并动态调整视图权重。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD在多视图NCD任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

TL;DR: InstructFLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的指令调优框架，用于提升人脸反欺骗（FAS）的泛化能力，通过解耦内容和风格指令，显著减少跨域训练冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸反欺骗中攻击类型语义理解不足和跨域训练冗余的问题。

Method: 集成视觉语言模型（VLM）增强视觉输入感知，采用元域策略学习统一模型，解耦指令为内容和风格组件。

Result: 在准确性上优于现有最优模型，大幅减少跨域训练冗余。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过指令调优和VLM的融合，显著提升了FAS的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间结构特性的对抗性人脸生成方法，无需迭代优化，仅需少量查询即可高成功率攻击人脸识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统（FRSs）的对抗性攻击对安全和隐私构成威胁，现有方法依赖迭代优化或转移性策略，效率低且不灵活。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间中的属性子空间（如性别或种族）生成对抗性人脸，仅需单次非自适应查询（100张图像）。

Result: 在AWS的CompareFaces API上，默认阈值下攻击成功率超过93%，且能控制生成人脸的属性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且灵活，为对抗性攻击提供了新思路，同时揭示了FRSs的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Result: 在真实和合成图像上的实验表明，该方法在光照调整和高频信息恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，该方法有效解决了低光图像增强中的特征纠缠问题，并提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into

recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的支气管肺发育不良（BPD）预后，通过领域特定预训练和优化技术取得了较高的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种常见的慢性肺病，对极低出生体重婴儿影响重大。现有预防措施存在严重风险，因此早期预测BPD预后至关重要，以避免不必要的治疗风险。

Method: 研究使用163名极低出生体重婴儿的胸部X光片，通过微调ResNet-50模型（基于成人胸部X光片预训练），采用渐进层冻结和CutMix增强等技术优化模型。

Result: 最佳模型在预测中重度BPD时，AUROC为0.78，平衡准确率为0.69，F1分数为0.67，显著优于ImageNet初始化和传统IRDS分级。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域特定预训练结合优化技术能够高效预测BPD预后，且模型计算可行，适合临床部署和未来联邦学习应用。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Result: 实验结果表明，MVAR模型优于现有方法，验证了其架构的有效性。

Conclusion: MVAR模型为多变量空气污染物预测提供了高效解决方案，并构建了标准化数据集支持研究。

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture.

Conclusion: DLC为扩散模型提供了高效的图像表示，支持文本到图像生成和组合性生成。

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Conclusion: CueCo通过整合对比学习和聚类，为无监督视觉表示学习提供了新的方向，展示了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior

low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible
density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the
challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with

expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its

Result: QuRe在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最优性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上表现出最强的人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了CIR中的假阴性问题，提升了检索性能与用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

TL;DR: DAM-QA利用Describe Anything Model（DAM）的区域感知能力，针对文本密集的VQA任务提出新框架，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本密集图像中的VQA任务，区域级描述能力对提取细粒度文本信息至关重要。

Method: 引入DAM-QA框架，通过聚合多个区域视图的答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中表现优于基线DAM，DocVQA上提升7+分，参数更少且性能最佳。

Conclusion: DAM类模型在高效使用和集成策略下，对文本密集和广泛VQA任务具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CytoSAE是一种稀疏自编码器，用于医学图像分析，能够识别形态学相关概念并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域缺乏解释基础模型推理的工具，稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在视觉领域已显示出潜力，但尚未应用于医学影像。

Method: 提出CytoSAE，一种稀疏自编码器，训练于40,000多张外周血单细胞图像，并验证其在骨髓细胞学等领域的泛化能力。

Result: CytoSAE能识别形态学相关概念，生成患者和疾病特异性概念，并在AML亚型分类任务中达到与最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学影像提供了可解释的工具，尤其在亚细胞层面具有潜力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对IIoT边缘计算环境的AIGC任务卸载框架，首次考虑了AIGC模型切换带来的延迟和能耗问题，并设计了基于多智能体深度确定性策略梯度的算法（MADDPG-MATO），显著降低了延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网（IIoT）与人工智能生成内容（AIGC）的结合为智能制造带来新机遇，但也面临计算密集型任务和低延迟需求的挑战。传统基于云计算的生成模型难以满足IIoT环境中AIGC任务的实时性要求，而边缘计算通过任务卸载可有效降低延迟。

Method: 提出了一种针对IIoT边缘计算环境的AIGC任务卸载框架，首次考虑了AIGC模型切换的延迟和能耗。IIoT设备作为多智能体协作将动态AIGC任务卸载到部署了不同生成模型的边缘服务器。设计了基于多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MADDPG-MATO）的算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，MADDPG-MATO在延迟、能耗和任务完成率上均优于基线算法，平均延迟降低6.98%，能耗降低7.12%，任务完成率提高3.72%。

Conclusion: MADDPG-MATO在动态高负载的IIoT环境中表现出鲁棒性和高效性，为AIGC任务在边缘计算中的优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial
Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart
manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to
computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative
models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time
requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can
effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature
of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher
demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing
environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC
model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent
collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge
servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task
offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental
results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an
average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%
increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model
numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is
robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

TL;DR: PGT-I扩展了PyTorch Geometric Temporal，通过分布式数据并行训练和两种新策略（index-batching和distributed-index-batching）解决了ST-GNNs在大规模数据集上的内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ST-GNNs在建模时空数据依赖方面表现强大，但受限于内存问题，主要应用于小规模数据集。分布式训练缺乏对时空模型的支持，且未充分利用时空数据特性。

Method: 提出PGT-I，集成分布式数据并行训练和两种新策略：index-batching（动态构建快照以减少内存开销）和distributed-index-batching（跨多GPU扩展处理）。

Result: 在PeMS数据集上首次实现无需图分区的ST-GNN训练，峰值内存使用减少89%，128 GPU下速度提升13.1倍。

Conclusion: PGT-I通过优化内存和计算效率，显著扩展了ST-GNNs在大规模数据集上的应用潜力。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for
modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications
have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory
constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks
lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of
spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we
present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch
Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two
novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index
techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically
at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while
distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable
processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training
of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing
peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over
standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MOFSimBench，一个用于评估通用机器学习原子间势（uMLIPs）在纳米多孔材料建模中性能的基准测试，发现数据质量对性能的影响大于模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估uMLIPs在实际应用中的可靠性，特别是在纳米多孔材料（如MOFs）建模中的表现，这些材料具有复杂的化学和结构特性。

Method: 通过MOFSimBench基准测试，评估20多种不同架构的uMLIPs在结构优化、分子动力学稳定性、体相性质预测和主客体相互作用等任务中的表现。

Result: 表现最佳的uMLIPs在所有任务中均优于经典力场和微调的机器学习势，表明其已准备好用于纳米多孔材料建模。

Conclusion: 数据质量（如训练集的多样性和非平衡构象的包含）对uMLIPs性能的影响大于模型架构，MOFSimBench为未来研究提供了开放资源。

Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as
powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and
efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their
reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an
open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials
are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy
storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents
distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural
complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from
existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to
evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials,
including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the
prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and
guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures
on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that
top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and
fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their
readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis
highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and
inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than
model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We
release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at
https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide
the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of
uMLIPs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用傅里叶神经算子（FNOs）解决均质化中的单元问题，结合快速傅里叶变换（FFT）方法，展示了FNOs在预测任意刚度分布问题中的高效性和普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决均质化中单元问题的传统深度学习方法速度慢且通用性不足，且缺乏明确的方向性指导。

Method: 构建FNO替代模型，模仿FFT方法的基本框架，无需训练即可预测任意刚度分布的单元问题解。

Result: FNOs在材料对比约束下能高精度预测解，无材料对称性、相数或界面几何限制，且计算效率与经典FFT求解器相当。

Conclusion: FNOs在微力学问题中潜力巨大，为FFT方法与FNOs的结合提供了新思路，有望促进两者间的交流。

Abstract: \noindent Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available
deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional
computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to
expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches
are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)
for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational
micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct
an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods
and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with
\emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast
constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions
on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the
geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is
sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical
empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we
construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the
obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the
basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In
particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily
handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for
solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This
connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.

Motivation: 解决群体机器人中异质控制的复杂性，减少对先验知识的依赖，并通过局部学习规则简化问题。

Method: 采用Hebbian学习作为生物启发的神经适应方法，通过局部信息实现异质性涌现，并基于群体行为演化学习规则。

Result: Hebbian学习自然涌现异质性，实现群体行为切换，显著提升群体能力，并可作为多智能体强化学习的替代方案。

Conclusion: Hebbian学习为群体机器人提供了一种简单有效的异质控制方法，减少了参数和先验知识的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm
robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning
presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies
on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for
learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of
attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,
thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules
across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the
curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian
learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive
prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This
work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,
resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved
swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning
rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in
standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling
narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain
results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We
introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted
principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses,
Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),
and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel
sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the
same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this
result.

Result: 研究发现并非所有模态都能提供独特见解，但多模态方法能更全面地理解协调动态。

Conclusion: 多模态方法提升了检测和分析在线协调行为的能力，为维护数字平台完整性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions
to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key
focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on
monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets
or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other.
However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in
multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing
the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off
between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the
balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly
coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we
assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how
varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our
findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that
with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of
coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze
coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the
integrity of digital platforms.

Result: SToFM在组织区域语义分割和细胞类型注释等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SToFM能全面理解ST数据，为生物组织研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich
insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells.
Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of
vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of
biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to
the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast
numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue
morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene
expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale
Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale
information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices
that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2)
Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the
sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest
high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves
outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region
semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive
understanding of ST data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物基因组的功能注释通常偏向蛋白质编码基因，忽略了ncRNA的重要性，而ncRNA对细菌和古菌的生理、应激反应和代谢调控至关重要。

Method: RNAMunin基于Rfam序列训练，使用约60 Gbp的长读长宏基因组数据，仅需基因组序列输入，无需转录组数据。

Result: RNAMunin是目前唯一能在大规模基因组序列中检测ncRNA的模型，且模型参数少、速度快。

Conclusion: RNAMunin填补了ncRNA检测领域的空白，为理解微生物的完整调控潜力提供了新工具。

Abstract: Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward
protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology,
stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic
sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for
understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper
presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding
ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for
large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs
totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from
approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary
samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on
genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence
as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do
not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in
order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail.
Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin
is very small and very fast.

Motivation: 传统方法将这些任务分开处理，且依赖MIDI数据，无法处理重复结构的乐谱。RUMAA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用预训练的乐谱和音频编码器，结合三流解码器，通过代理任务捕捉任务间的依赖关系。

Result: 在公开钢琴音乐数据集上，RUMAA在非重复乐谱上达到先进水平，在重复乐谱上表现更优，同时提供良好的转录和错误检测结果。

Conclusion: RUMAA展示了统一处理音乐性能分析任务的潜力，尤其在处理复杂乐谱结构时表现突出。

Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music
performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment,
score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end
manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA
integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel
tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It
aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length
performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on
manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA
matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and
outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while
also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.

TL;DR: QTTS是一种基于新型音频编解码器QDAC的TTS框架，通过多码本建模和并行预测技术提升合成质量和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归TTS方法依赖单码本表示，导致信息丢失，难以恢复细粒度细节（如韵律、音色）。

Method: QTTS采用QDAC编解码器，结合Hierarchical Parallel架构和Delay Multihead方法，实现高质量合成和快速推理。

Result: 实验表明，QTTS在合成质量和表达内容保留上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多码本建模是实现高保真、通用语音和音频生成的有前景方向。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete
modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on
single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information
loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these
methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,
speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing
voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our
new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end
training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves
superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless
compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies:
the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model
inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay
Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to
accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive
content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via
multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity,
general-purpose speech and audio generation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 结合YOLO和SAM模型，提出了一种用于骨科骨盆X光片中解剖标志和复杂轮廓分割的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础分割模型（如SAM和MedSAM）无法直接用于医学影像中的精细解剖标志分割，需要特定提示。

Method: 利用YOLO生成边界框作为SAM的输入提示，结合两者的优势，构建混合模型。

Result: 该方法在分割8个解剖标志的基础上，扩展到72个标志和16个复杂轮廓区域，表现优异。

Conclusion: YOLO与SAM的结合在骨科骨盆X光片的分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Motivation: MR成像在临床诊断和治疗中至关重要，但现有的MR-to-CT合成方法在空间对齐和图像质量上存在问题，影响下游临床应用。

Method: 采用3D小波潜在扩散模型，结合小波残差模块和双跳跃连接注意力机制，在潜在空间中实现模态转换，同时保持解剖结构完整性。

Result: 生成的CT图像在空间对齐和图像质量上表现优异，尤其是骨骼结构和软组织对比度的表现。

Conclusion: 3D-WLDM为MR-to-CT合成提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案，有望推动相关临床应用的发展。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新生儿肺动脉高压的诊断依赖超声心动图，但其准确性受操作者主观影响，现有自动化方法多针对成人且依赖单视角图像，泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用多视角变分自编码器（VAE）框架，从多视角超声心动图视频中提取复杂潜在表征，并与单视角和监督学习方法对比。

Result: 结果显示多视角学习方法在泛化能力和分类准确性上优于单视角和监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习能有效提升新生儿肺动脉高压评估的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

Motivation: 探索基础模型在复杂、可变形解剖结构（如乳腺MRI）中的配准能力，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 评估五种预训练编码器（DINO-v2、SAM、MedSAM、SSLSAM、MedCLIP）在四种乳腺配准任务中的表现。

Result: SAM在整体配准上表现优异，但对纤维腺体组织的细节捕捉不足；医学或乳腺特定预训练未提升性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究领域特定训练对配准的影响，并开发提升全局配准和细节准确性的策略。

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration
performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to
understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore
targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure
accuracy. We also publicly release our code at
\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Result: 该方法能识别与治疗相关的特定肝脏组织变化路径，并优于传统非影像学方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在非侵入性影像数据中预测活检特征，并在独立队列中验证了其适用性。

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Result: 在386,371个图块上评估，优于U-Net变体和基于Transformer的基线方法。

Conclusion: UTS在减少标注和计算成本的同时保持准确性，适用于临床任务如肿瘤-间质定量和手术边缘评估。

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology
that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the
segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this
approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits
the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology
and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three
categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports
clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical
margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it
outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset
will be available at GitHub.

Result: 实证验证表明，GPT-3在20个示例内达到理论熵极限的99%，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 论文提供了优化计算效率和提取校准不确定性估计的实用方法，为位置感知架构的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning
capabilities, adapting to new tasks without parameter updates. While this
phenomenon has been successfully modeled as implicit Bayesian inference, recent
empirical findings reveal a fundamental contradiction: transformers
systematically violate the martingale property, a cornerstone requirement of
Bayesian updating on exchangeable data. This violation challenges the
theoretical foundations underlying uncertainty quantification in critical
applications.
  Our theoretical analysis establishes four key results: (1) positional
encodings induce martingale violations of order $\Theta(\log n / n)$; (2)
transformers achieve information-theoretic optimality with excess risk
$O(n^{-1/2})$ in expectation over orderings; (3) the implicit posterior
representation converges to the true Bayesian posterior in the space of
sufficient statistics; and (4) we derive the optimal chain-of-thought length as
$k^* = \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ with explicit constants, providing
a principled approach to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.
Empirical validation on GPT-3 confirms predictions (1)-(3), with transformers
reaching 99\% of theoretical entropy limits within 20 examples. Our framework
provides practical methods for extracting calibrated uncertainty estimates from
position-aware architectures and optimizing computational efficiency in
deployment.

Result: 研究发现，探索与利用的平衡是共生偏差影响算法选择的关键因素。

Conclusion: 结论表明，在算法选择中，GTE估计的符号比其精确值更为重要，且探索与利用的平衡对偏差有显著影响。

Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two
recommendation algorithms. Prior work has shown that the standard
difference-in-means estimator is biased in estimating the global treatment
effect (GTE) due to a particular form of interference between experimental
units. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms
contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms,
resulting in interference between the two groups. The bias arising from this
type of data sharing is known as "symbiosis bias". In this paper, we highlight
that, for decision-making purposes, the sign of the GTE often matters more than
its precise magnitude when selecting the better algorithm. We formalize this
insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize
when the sign of the expected GTE estimate under data sharing aligns with or
contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of
exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how symbiosis bias
impacts algorithm selection.

Conclusion: Newfluence在高维环境中表现优于现有方法，且其框架可扩展至其他流行技术（如Shapley值）的分析。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help
scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions
and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have
emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.
  However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on
low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller
than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often
operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these
assumptions.
  In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in
high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that
influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then
introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains
similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved
accuracy.
  Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing
methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues.
Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be
applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.

Conclusion: FairAA在实用性和公平性间取得平衡，适用于敏感场景的表示学习。

Abstract: Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents
data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA
provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can
inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In
this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation
that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the
learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that
addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach
incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and
interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on
synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios,
demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean
maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially
compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the
real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility.
The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and
fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in
sensitive applications.

TL;DR: JSQA框架通过感知引导的对比预训练和微调，显著提升了语音质量评估（SQA）的性能。

Motivation: MOS标签的高方差和缺乏感知因素的融入导致现有SQA方法效果不佳。

Method: JSQA采用两阶段框架：1）基于JND对的感知对比预训练音频编码器；2）微调用于MOS预测。

Result: 实验表明，感知对比预训练显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 感知因素的融入对SQA性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a
high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score
(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging
for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent
variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions
have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual
factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead
to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework
that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning
on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS
prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are
then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity
information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean
LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at
different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with
audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results
suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly
improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared
against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These
findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly
contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid
advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting
challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing
returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents
capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in
and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus
on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and
discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative
potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive
framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation
across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We
distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research
processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified
taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and
human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of
current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey
delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific
innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing
processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological
foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical
guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also
highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of
increasingly autonomous AI-driven science. Resources related to this survey can

requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning
annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we
introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative
AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them
into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements
of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined
set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images
acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available.
The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of
the simplified images is publicly available.

Result: 模型学习到比原始数据小32倍的表示，适用于重建、生成和推断，且潜在通道对应不同宇宙学尺度的特征。

Conclusion: CosmoFlow成功学习到紧凑且语义丰富的潜在表示，具有解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn
low dimensional representations of data that preserve information required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that flow matching based
generative models can learn compact, semantically rich latent representations
of field level cold dark matter (CDM) simulation data without supervision. Our
model, CosmoFlow, learns representations 32x smaller than the raw field data,
usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter
inference. Our model also learns interpretable representations, in which
different latent channels correspond to features at different cosmological
scales.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需校准的跨数据集EEG解码框架（AFPM），通过空间对齐和帧-块编码提升BCI的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG解码模型在跨数据集学习和泛化中的问题，如通道布局不一致、信号分布非平稳性和神经生理学先验整合不足。

Method: AFPM框架包含空间对齐（选择任务相关通道并统一布局）和帧-块编码（将信号建模为统一时空块）。

Result: 在运动想象和事件相关电位任务上，性能分别提升4.40%和3.58%，优于17种现有方法。

Conclusion: AFPM是首个无需校准的跨数据集EEG解码框架，显著提升了BCI的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel
layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited
neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a
plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has
two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels
based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and
remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding,
which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG
decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific
tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to
4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our
knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding
framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the
resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits,
such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient
way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their
genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the
workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic
prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the
models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,
which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we
proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice
breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally
ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual
projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual
analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene
visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory
genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the
quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified
regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback
from breeders.

*Garyoung Kim,Huisung Kwon,Seoju Yun,Yu-Won Youn*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 生成式AI不仅复制人类创造力，还再现了根深蒂固的文化偏见。本研究探讨了四种AI模型如何理解和表达“丑陋”，揭示了其中嵌入的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批判性分析生成式AI对“丑陋”概念的理解和表达，揭示其背后的文化和社会偏见。

Method: 通过迭代提示提取13个与“丑陋”相关的形容词，并在四种AI模型中生成624张图像，对图像中的人口和社会经济属性进行编码和主题分析。

Result: AI模型倾向于将“丑陋”与老年白人男性形象关联，反映了社会偏见和矛盾偏见。定性分析显示，传统物理标记（如不对称和衰老）仍是核心视觉主题。

Conclusion: 尽管试图创造更平等的表征，生成式AI仍延续了继承性和矛盾性偏见，强调了开发伦理AI训练范式和包容性方法的重要性。

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces
deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how
concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study
investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express
ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these
representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through
iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across
four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes
within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our
findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old
white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical
biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups
inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes
onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite
supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional
physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.
These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal
representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and
paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical
AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据预处理而非真正的数据质量改进（DQI），且数据驱动方法在优化机器学习模型性能时存在不足。

Method: 系统整合了数据驱动（如填补、异常检测、特征选择等）和流程驱动（如评估DQ和DQI程序）技术，并通过可视化分析支持用户操作。

Result: 通过案例研究、评估和用户研究，验证了系统在提升数据质量和模型性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: d-DQIVAR系统为用户提供了一种结合专家和领域知识的实用工作流程，显著提升了数据质量和机器学习模型性能。

Abstract: Approaches to enhancing data quality (DQ) are classified into two main
categories: data- and process-driven. However, prior research has predominantly
utilized batch data preprocessing within the data-driven framework, which often
proves insufficient for optimizing machine learning (ML) model performance and
frequently leads to distortions in data characteristics. Existing studies have
primarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality
improvement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual
analytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML
model performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that
leverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques
tackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format
standardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection.
Process-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by
considering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness
expert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through
case studies, evaluations, and user studies.

<details>

Motivation: 传统降维方法需要大量试错和计算开销，缺乏对数据集内在复杂性的量化指导。

Result: 验证了度量能准确近似数据集复杂性，显著提升降维优化效率且不损失精度。

Conclusion: 数据集自适应方法为降维优化提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and
determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of
the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often
resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we
propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural
complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a
dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to
represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately
represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us
to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given
dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design
and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We
quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth
complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding
dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our
dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR
optimization without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于删除信道的神经极性解码器（NPD），降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有极性解码器在删除信道中计算复杂度高（O(N^4)），限制了其应用。NPD旨在降低复杂度并扩展应用范围。

Method: 扩展NPD架构以支持删除信道，仅修改其中一个神经网络。复杂度降至O(AN log N)，A为用户定义的预算参数。

Result: 在删除率δ∈{0.01, 0.1}的信道中验证了NPD性能，并展示了列表解码的进一步改进。

Conclusion: NPD降低了复杂度，未来可能应用于DNA存储等技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with
a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit
high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This
limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to
short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing
NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we
extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,
the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating
fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support
deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational
complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a
computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.
We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates
$\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by
the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced
complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further
improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have
applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

Abstract: This paper surveys the use of Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and
Claude, in computer science education, focusing on key aspects of accuracy,
authenticity, and assessment. Through a literature review, we highlight both
the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI
improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such

AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for
addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid
assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias
detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and
educators. Our findings suggest that the successful integration of AI requires
a balanced approach, considering ethical, pedagogical, and technical factors.
Future research may explore enhancing AI accuracy, preserving academic

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在简历筛选中是否真正具备评估能力，而非仅表面无偏见。

Method: 通过两部分实验对八种主流AI平台进行审计，分别测试偏见和核心能力。

Result: 实验1发现复杂偏见，实验2揭示部分模型仅依赖关键词匹配，缺乏实质评估能力。

Conclusion: 提出“中立幻觉”概念，建议采用双重验证框架，确保AI工具既公平又有效。

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a
two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex,
contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates
merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated
core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared
unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation,
relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the
"Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of
bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.
This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation
framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable
competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 鼓励AI工具发展，但需持续培训以确保研究的实质价值。

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys,
synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While
the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not
always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice
(TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models
for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024),
we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic
AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human
analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their
tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier
eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using
statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully
understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize
a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018)
throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role
that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging
the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for
continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value
of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon
results most effectively and ethically.

Motivation: 研究旨在量化开源LLMs的安全风险，揭示其可修改性带来的潜在危害，尤其是模型规模扩大时的安全差距问题。

Method: 开发了一个开源工具包，评估不同规模的Llama-3和Qwen-2.5模型在去除保护措施后的生化、网络能力、拒绝率和生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，模型规模越大，安全差距越显著，去除保护措施后危险能力显著增强。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发抗篡改的保护措施，并欢迎社区贡献工具包，以共同提升开源模型的安全性。

Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation,
personalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage -
modifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially
subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This
leads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a
model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those
safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for
state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical
and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from
two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to
405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that
the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous
capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the
Safety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve
as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation
for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome
contributions to the toolkit from the community.

Conclusion: 软最大平滑方法为最优治疗政策值推断提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment
policy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal
policy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized
treatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal
value is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing
inference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this
non-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators
based on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These
approaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic
parametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches
that directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place
parametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the
computation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic
$L^\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that
prohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of
constructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By
carefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show
that a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters
that are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In
particular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a
special case. Our estimator obtains $\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids
parametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often
statistically efficient.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

Conclusion: RL在量子电路设计中遵循“无免费午餐”原则，需针对任务选择算法，BenchRL-QAS框架公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit
synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking
effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers
remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing
interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum
computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver
potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is
a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.
Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,
implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth
circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and
repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address
this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum
circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision
operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the
physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum
conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate
set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit
connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses
neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its
depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation
that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on
two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,
demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow
recirculation.

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography
(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The
inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their
over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards
general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models
(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the
real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research
progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of
first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current
state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,
this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their
methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that
most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on
transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for
self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely
limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.
In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work
should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and
trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We
believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,
and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the
translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.
