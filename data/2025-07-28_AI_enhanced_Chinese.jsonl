We introduce\nSpecification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables\nan LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC\nemploys a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a\nresponse based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,\nand then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A\nfinal, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected\nspecification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding\ntasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted\nspecifications in 50-70\\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability\nby over 90\\%.

Many\napproaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying\nskills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.\nThese conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that\nassume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks\nannotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated\nas signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in\nannotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model\nthat incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy\nannotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic\ndisagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at\nrecovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than\ntraditional aggregation methods.

We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as\nLightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results\nhighlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the\noptimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing\naccuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPBiLoss\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53d7\u635f\u3002", "method": "PBiLoss\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u503e\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff08PopPos\u548cPopNeg\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePBiLoss\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u5982\u964d\u4f4ePRU\u548cPRI\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PBiLoss\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Standard retrieval process prioritized\nrelevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In\ncontrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the\nusefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries\nrequiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality.

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy.

For instance, in healthcare\napplications, we might like to learn features that contain information about\npathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic\nvariability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable\nacross all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with\nAnti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement\nframework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)\ncharacteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during\ntraining, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift\nat test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be\nsemantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain\ninformation relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,\nwhich encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet\nmay degrade performance due to associations with content present in training\ndata that do not generalize.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs.

Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": "19 pages, 2 figures. Accepted as a spotlight poster at ICML 2025", "summary": "The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the \"Fisher diagonal\")\nhas frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,\nthe Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's\nlikelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or\nthousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At\nthe same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer\ncompute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.\nThis paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal\ncan be obtained \"for free\" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that\nhas already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive\nset of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we\ndemonstrate that the \"Squisher\" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an\napproximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher\ndiagonal while outperforming baseline methods.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

This study introduces a\ncomprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset\ncontaining 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,\n11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where\nthe Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.\nTo reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using\nthe Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced\ndataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained\nthe maximum accuracy of 0.9611.

By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

By decomposing the network-level\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a\nunified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces\ncomputational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances\nscalability.

Reservoir\ncomputing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional\ndeep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly\nstructured and fixed reservoir network.

Anonymized free text\nclinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of\none academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal\nMedicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE\nRC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities\n(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on\ndetecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged\nF1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences\nfor the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best\nperforming model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and\n0.62 using predicted entities.

As mass spectrometers will be\ncentral to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from\ntheir data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential\nfor unbiased life detection.

Here, we show that molecular\nassembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been\nproduced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for\nlife detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as\nbuilding blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.\nSecond, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be\nphysically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from\nother approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular\ncomplexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass\nspectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address\nthis, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly\nwith high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.\nSimulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double\nmodel error, emphasizing the need for standardization.

In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round\nrepeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).\nIn Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or\nan LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling\nLLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation\nrates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points\ncompared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This\nfinding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost\nof selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about\ncooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the\nlikelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is\nparticularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the\nassumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines\ncompared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher\nfollowing prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in\ncooperative behavior.

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

Prior work can be categorized\ninto two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then\ncluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods\nincorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.\nHowever, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve\nsegmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in\nwhether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up\nstrategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent\nself-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a\nlexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic\nprogramming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On\nthe five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable\nstate-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times\nfaster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of\nES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate\nboundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as\nwell.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best\npre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%\non F1 and 4.0% on accuracy.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals.

This advanced approach uses on-chain\nevent logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential\nTime-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly\ndetection.

Our key findings are: 1)\nperceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness,\nsound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived\nextraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral\ninteractions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful\ncontexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform\nspeaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful\ninteractions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing\npsychological research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u81ea\u8eab\u6027\u683c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\uff08APP\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4eba\u683c\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u4f1a\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u9762\u8bd5\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5ba2\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4eba\u683c\u63a8\u65ad\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4eba\u683c\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u8868\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u4f1a\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u6027\u9762\u8bd5\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5ba2\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5916\u5411\u6027\u3001\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u56e0\u60c5\u5883\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5b9a\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u76f8\u5173\uff1b3\uff09\u624b\u5de5\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b4\uff09\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u683c\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u60c5\u5883\u5bf9\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u624b\u5de5\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u4eba\u683c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical\nfindings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep\nlearning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed\nclasses. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image\nPre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the\nlatent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space.

To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D\nmodel represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose\nrelative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,\nthe pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the\ndoor for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982NeRF\u548c3DGS\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u75653D\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u53163DGS\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}
