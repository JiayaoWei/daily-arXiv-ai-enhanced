### [1] [MemeMind: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18919)
*Hexiang Gu,Qifan Yu,Saihui Hou,Zhiqin Fang,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MemeMind数据集和MemeGuard框架，用于提升有害表情包的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展加剧了有害内容的传播，现有数据集缺乏系统性、大规模、多样性和可解释性，阻碍了有害表情包检测的进步。

Method: 提出了MemeMind数据集，具有科学严谨的标准、大规模、多样性、双语支持和详细推理标注；并开发了MemeGuard框架，整合多模态信息和推理建模。

Result: 实验表明，MemeGuard在有害表情包检测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind和MemeGuard填补了当前数据集的空白，为有害表情包检测提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [2] [Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18998)
*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs倾向于将记忆误认为推理能力，导致在STEM领域任务中表现出45%以上的不一致性，尤其在科学和医学领域最为明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正学习推理模式，还是仅记忆数据以表现能力，揭示其自我认知缺陷对可信度的影响。

Method: 采用新颖框架分析LLMs在STEM领域的泛化能力，评估其面对逻辑一致任务扰动时的表现。

Result: LLMs因记忆解决方案而高估自身推理能力，导致可行性评估不一致性超过45%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM架构和训练模式存在缺陷，需改进以提升模型自我认知的一致性和可信度。

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code
and results are available publicly at

### [3] [Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19004)
*Brian Siyuan Zheng,Alisa Liu,Orevaoghene Ahia,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，现代分词器生成的非常规分词对指令调优模型的性能影响较小，甚至在某些任务中能提升表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型对训练中未见过的非常规分词的鲁棒性，以及这些分词是否能在特定任务中提升性能。

Method: 通过20个基准测试评估模型在非常规分词（如随机分词和字符级分词）下的表现，并分析其鲁棒性来源。

Result: 指令调优模型在非常规分词下保留高达93.4%的性能，字符级分词在某些任务中提升14%，数字对齐分词提升算术任务33%。

Conclusion: 模型对分词器的依赖低于预期，干预推理时分词策略可提升性能，鲁棒性源于指令调优阶段。

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

### [4] [Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19028)
*Weijie Xu,Yiwen Wang,Chi Xue,Xiangkun Hu,Xi Fang,Guimin Dong,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiSCo是一种新的统计框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在长文本响应中的群体公平性，通过检测不同人口群体间的语义差异来识别细微偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法忽视了长文本响应中的偏见和LLM输出的内在变异性，影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: FiSCo在声明级别操作，利用蕴含检查比较跨群体响应的语义一致性，并通过统计假设检验检测偏见。

Result: 实验表明，FiSCo能更可靠地识别细微偏见，减少LLM随机变异的影响，优于其他评估指标。

Conclusion: FiSCo提供了一种更精细的方法来评估LLMs的公平性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

### [5] [Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037)
*Omer Luxembourg,Haim Permuter,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS) 是一种无需额外训练的推理方法，通过分组并行解掩码，显著提升非自回归文本生成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于置信度或熵的解掩码启发式方法在并行解掩码时表现不佳，无法处理多位置间的依赖关系，限制了推理速度。

Method: DUS 利用一阶马尔可夫假设将序列位置分组为非相邻标记，实现并行解掩码，减少去噪器调用次数至 O(log B)。

Result: 在数学和代码生成任务中，DUS 优于基于置信度的并行解掩码方法，且无需修改去噪器。

Conclusion: DUS 是一种轻量级、高效的方法，释放了掩码扩散语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

### [6] [NLPnorth @ TalentCLEF 2025: Comparing Discriminative, Contrastive, and Prompt-Based Methods for Job Title and Skill Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19058)
*Mike Zhang,Rob van der Goot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了多语言职位匹配和基于职位名称的技能预测任务，比较了不同方法，发现提示方法在任务A中表现最佳，而微调分类方法在任务B中表现较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 职位匹配和技能预测在计算化招聘市场中具有重要意义，可提升候选人匹配、职业路径预测和市场分析。

Method: 比较了微调分类、微调对比和提示方法，并利用ESCO的额外数据增强模型。

Result: 任务A中提示方法MAP为0.492，任务B中微调分类方法MAP为0.290。任务A排名5/20，任务B排名3/14。

Conclusion: 多语言大模型在两项任务中表现最佳，提示方法和微调分类方法分别适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

### [7] [MFTCXplain: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Moral Reasoning of LLMs through Hate Speech Multi-hop Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19073)
*Jackson Trager,Francielle Vargas,Diego Alves,Matteo Guida,Mikel K. Ngueajio,Ameeta Agrawal,Flor Plaza-del-Arco,Yalda Daryanai,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MFTCXplain是一个多语言基准数据集，用于通过仇恨言论的多跳解释评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的道德推理能力，揭示了LLMs在道德推理任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准缺乏道德分类的注释，且主要关注英语，限制了跨文化道德推理的评估。

Method: 引入MFTCXplain数据集，包含3000条推文，标注了仇恨言论标签、道德类别和文本级解释。

Result: LLMs在仇恨言论检测上表现良好（F1达0.836），但在道德情感预测上较弱（F1<0.35），且在少数语言中解释对齐有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在理解和反映人类道德推理方面能力有限。

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Health Sentinel是一个多阶段信息提取管道，结合机器学习和非机器学习方法，从在线文章中提取疾病暴发相关的结构化事件信息，以支持早期疾病暴发检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于指标的监测方法存在挑战，而在线媒体作为非正式信息来源日益流行，但手动筛选大量文章不切实际。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取管道，结合机器学习和非机器学习方法，从在线文章中提取结构化事件信息。

Result: 自2022年4月以来，处理了超过3亿篇新闻文章，识别了超过95,000个独特健康事件，其中3,500个被专家列为潜在暴发。

Conclusion: Health Sentinel有效支持了疾病暴发的早期检测，为公共卫生专家提供了及时干预的数据支持。

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

### [9] [Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19089)
*Nathaniel Getachew,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StorySim是一个可编程框架，用于生成合成故事以评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的心理理论（ToM）和世界建模（WM）能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准可能因预训练数据污染而受限，StorySim通过可控Storyboard生成新颖、组合的故事提示，以精确操纵角色视角和事件。

Method: 使用StorySim设计一阶和二阶ToM任务及WM任务，控制对心理状态的跟踪和建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，多数LLMs在WM任务上表现优于ToM任务，且对人类推理优于无生命物体。还发现启发式行为（如近因偏差和过度依赖早期事件）。

Conclusion: StorySim为评估LLMs的ToM和WM能力提供了有效工具，揭示了模型行为中的启发式偏差。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

### [10] [Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113)
*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法（HAF）来评估LLMs对毒性的解释是否与人类理性一致，并通过实验发现LLMs在复杂提示下的解释存在不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以评估LLMs对毒性的自由形式解释，因此需要一种新方法来增强LLMs在下游任务中的可信度。

Method: 提出了一种基于理论的多维标准HAF，开发了六种无需人类参与的指标来评估LLMs的解释。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在简单提示下能生成合理解释，但在复杂提示下解释不一致且无意义。

Conclusion: HAF方法有效揭示了LLMs在毒性解释中的局限性，为提升其可信度提供了新方向。

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

Motivation: 开源大语言模型在数据密集型任务中存在局限性，研究旨在提升其数据分析能力。

Method: 通过构建多样化的真实场景数据集，评估模型在数据理解、代码生成和战略规划三个维度的表现。

Result: 发现战略规划质量是性能关键，交互设计和任务复杂性影响推理能力，数据质量比多样性更重要。

Conclusion: 提出数据合成方法，显著提升开源大语言模型的分析推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

*Yun Tang,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合语音和文本优化的方法（J-TAED），通过结合语音和文本输入模态提升ASR准确性，并在推理时仅需语音输入。该方法有效缓解了数据稀缺问题，并在多个数据集上显著降低了WER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量文本语料库提升ASR准确性，并解决领域不匹配任务中的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 联合训练语音和文本输入模态的TAED模型（J-TAED），统一内部表示，并支持基于文本的领域适应。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上WER降低5.8~12.8%，在两个领域外数据集上通过文本适应分别降低15.3%和17.8%的WER。

Conclusion: J-TAED成功整合了语音和语言信息，显著提升了ASR性能，尤其在领域适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

*Christopher Toukmaji,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何将大语言模型（LLMs）适应于低资源语言的任务，比较了多种适应技术，发现少样本提示和翻译测试方法优于基于梯度的适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何优化LLMs在低资源语言中的上下文学习性能，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过五种目标语言、三种基础LLMs和七项下游任务，比较少样本提示、翻译测试、微调、嵌入重初始化和指令微调等技术。

Result: 少样本提示和翻译测试方法表现最佳，基于梯度的方法因灾难性遗忘而性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的上下文学习提供了重要见解，并公开了数据集和模型。

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型和RNN的两步方法，用于从长文本中预测五因素模型人格特质，提升了准确性、效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统问卷在人格评估中受限，NLP通过开放文本提供了新途径，但长文本建模（如超过2000词的访谈）仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 使用滑动窗口微调预训练语言模型提取上下文嵌入；2. 应用带注意力机制的RNN整合长距离依赖关系。

Result: 通过消融实验和与LLaMA、Longformer等模型的对比，证明了该方法在预测准确性、效率和可解释性上的提升。

Conclusion: 结合语言特征和长文本建模的方法，为从生活叙事中推进人格评估提供了潜力。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Result: 适度多样性的LLM生成数据在标注数据不足时能提升性能，过高多样性则有害。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM作为数据生成器的未来研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Method: EmoStage利用开源LLM的推理能力，引入视角转换推断用户心理状态和需求，并结合阶段识别确保响应与咨询过程一致。

Result: 实验表明，EmoStage在日语和中文心理咨询场景中提升了基础模型的响应质量，与数据驱动方法表现相当。

Conclusion: EmoStage为AI心理咨询提供了一种高效且隐私友好的解决方案，无需依赖额外数据。

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将语音学归因、SSM建模和提示策略结合于CAPT中，为发音反馈提供了更高效和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Conclusion: 该框架为角色保真度提供了更精确的评估，揭示了维持角色一致性的挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Result: G-SAE在毒性检测、写作风格识别和隐私属性识别中表现优异，提升了单义性和可控性。

Conclusion: 研究为提升大型语言模型的机制可解释性和控制提供了实用指南。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上评估，VeilProbe在黑盒设置下表现优越且有效。

Conclusion: VeilProbe为黑盒环境下的预训练文本检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

Method: 提出一个完整的推理规则学习流程，包括三个基于规则的推理任务、理论框架和端到端架构。通过语言VAEs实现推理规则的显式嵌入和记忆。

Result: 实验发现：1）显式信号监督下推理规则可解耦；2）先验知识注入能提升模型性能；3）数学推理任务中样本数量增加无法持续提升性能，且ffn层比注意力层更有效保持规则分离。

Conclusion: 显式嵌入推理规则能提升语言模型的泛化性和可控性，但需注意性能瓶颈和层选择对规则分离的影响。

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Result: LLMs在分歧预测上表现不佳，RLVR推理反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 需改进LLM在分歧建模中的评估与性能。

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English

proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高效推理策略是否会导致模型行为不一致，从而影响模型的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 引入$ICBENCH$基准，从三个维度（任务设置、训练目标与学习行为、内部推理与自我解释）评估LRMs的不一致性。

Result: 高效推理策略（如No-Thinking和Simple Token-Budget）增加了所有三种不一致性，且大型模型虽更一致但仍存在广泛问题。

Conclusion: 高效推理虽提升效率，但可能引入行为不一致风险，需进一步研究其监督有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

Motivation: 减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时最小化超低位量化对性能的影响。

Method: 提出Anchor Score量化KV缓存对误差的敏感度，设计AnTKV框架和高效triton内核。

Result: AnTKV在4位量化下优于现有方法，1位和0.375位量化下困惑度显著降低。

Conclusion: AnTKV有效平衡了KV缓存压缩与模型性能，适用于超长上下文场景。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a

online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,

significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of

*Ashish Chouhan,Michael Gertz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 团队提出了一种名为heiDS的RAG框架，用于生成基于电子健康记录的临床证据答案，重点研究了查询依赖的检索策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定top-k检索策略在生成临床答案时的局限性，提高答案的事实性和相关性。

Method: 采用查询依赖的检索策略（包括autocut*和elbow两种新方法），结合RAG框架生成答案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比固定top-k策略更能生成事实性和相关性高的答案。

Conclusion: 查询依赖的检索策略在临床问答任务中表现更优。

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自由文本药物剂量说明转换为结构化格式的方法，比较了提示方法和微调方法，并提出了结合NERL和LLM的混合策略，显著提高了结构化准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法国处方中的药物剂量说明常存在歧义或不规范，限制了传统机器学习管道的效果，因此需要探索更有效的方法。

Method: 比较了提示方法和微调LLMs的方法，并与基于命名实体识别和链接（NERL）的基线系统对比，最终提出了一种混合策略。

Result: 混合策略（NERL+LLM）实现了91%的结构化准确性，同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 结合NERL和LLM的混合方法在提高准确性的同时优化了计算效率，适用于实际临床场景。

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

TL;DR: KnowMap通过动态构建知识库，提升LLM在特定任务中的性能，实验显示性能提升17.71%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在开放世界任务中表现优异，但难以快速适应新任务，传统微调方法成本高且易导致遗忘。

Method: 动态构建知识库，通过小型知识嵌入模型为LLM提供任务特定知识。

Result: 在ScienceWorld基准测试中，gpt-4-turbo性能提升17.71%。

Conclusion: KnowMap高效且有效，通过环境与经验知识增强LLM推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental
and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCStat利用原始注意力logits提出了一种统计框架，通过相对上下文化（RC）测量token段的对齐，并实现了高效的RC上界。应用包括KV压缩和更高保真度的归因分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖Softmax归一化的注意力权重，掩盖了pre-Softmax logits的丰富结构。RCStat旨在利用这些logits提升性能。

Method: 引入RCStat框架，通过RC随机变量测量token段的上下文对齐，并推导RC的高效上界。应用于KV压缩和归因分析。

Result: 在问答、摘要和归因基准测试中，RCStat实现了显著的性能提升，达到了最先进的压缩和归因效果。

Conclusion: RCStat无需模型重新训练，即可提供高效的KV压缩和高保真度的归因分析，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

Motivation: 明确自动指标在机器翻译评估中的表现上限，通过引入人类基线进行元评估。

Method: 在机器翻译元评估中引入人类基线，比较自动指标与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 先进自动指标常与人类基线表现相当或更优，但需注意其局限性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了机器翻译评估的测量能力限制，呼吁对该领域进展的测量方法进行更深入讨论。

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理链的不可靠性和缺乏透明度问题。

Method: 结合MRF-ETM生成主题感知的推理链，使用CSBert对齐因果推理，并通过统计过滤无效链。

Result: ECCoT提高了LLM的透明度和决策可信度，减少了偏见。

Conclusion: ECCoT为LLM提供了更可靠的推理验证框架，增强了其实际应用的可信度。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多模态聚合方法，用于检测网络仇恨言论传播者，结合文本、用户活动和社交网络信息，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线仇恨言论的自动检测对净化网络环境至关重要，而用户层面的分析能更深入理解仇恨言论的传播现象。

Method: 采用多模态聚合方法，整合用户的潜在仇恨文本、活动数据和社交网络信息。

Result: 在Twitter、Gab和Parler数据集上验证，该方法显著优于传统文本和图基方法，适用于不同平台和大规模数据。

Conclusion: 多模态方法能有效检测仇恨言论传播者，并适用于编码信息、种族煽动等复杂场景，为干预措施提供支持。

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

Motivation: LLMs在生成连贯文本时存在幻觉问题（事实不准确），自校正方法通过多轮验证和外部知识修正这一问题，但在新闻摘要领域研究较少。

Method: 研究了两种先进的自校正系统，利用三种搜索引擎的证据校正幻觉摘要，并分析了系统性能。

Result: 揭示了搜索引擎片段和少量示例提示的实用性，以及G-Eval与人工评估的高度一致性。

Conclusion: 自校正方法在新闻摘要领域具有潜力，搜索引擎证据和少量示例提示能有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language

specific goal. By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the
structured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability
across diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and
efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

TL;DR: RPT能提升LLMs的推理能力，但对新领域的泛化能力有限，改进效果在相似任务中显著，但在不同推理模式的领域中可能消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RPT在不同领域的泛化能力，填补现有工作仅评估相同领域数据的空白。

Method: 通过观察性和干预性研究，比较RPT模型与基础模型在多个领域的表现。

Result: RPT在相似任务中带来显著提升，但在不同推理模式的领域中泛化不一致，改进效果可能消失。

Conclusion: RPT的泛化能力有限，需进一步研究以提升其跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

TL;DR: 提出并验证了一种基于合成病例模拟的方法，用于评估症状检查器算法更新对罕见疾病诊断性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见疾病评估数据不足和手动创建病例成本高的问题。

Method: 利用人类表型本体（HPO）生成合成病例，模拟症状检查器访谈，预测算法更新后的性能变化。

Result: 对于有频率信息的疾病，预测效果良好（R²=0.831），但对无频率信息的疾病预测误差较大。

Conclusion: 该方法为罕见疾病的算法性能评估提供了一种透明且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

Motivation: 长语音识别中，基于多头注意力（MHA）的模型因序列长度的二次复杂度问题表现不佳，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用线性复杂度的双向循环注意力（RA）层，提出了一种长格式训练范式，并引入了方向丢弃（Direction Dropout）正则化方法。

Result: 双向RA层在短格式和长格式应用中均能达到MHA的准确性，且效率更高；长格式训练进一步提升了RA性能，吞吐量提高44%。

Conclusion: RA层在长语音识别中优于MHA和有限上下文注意力（LCA），结合方向丢弃和交替方向解码模式，实现了更高的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中取得了显著进展，但如何最优整合SFT和RL仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析标记分布和学习动态，提出SRFT方法，结合SFT和RL的优势，利用熵感知权重机制直接优化LLM。

Result: 实验表明，SRFT在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率达到59.1%，优于零RL方法9.0%。

Conclusion: SRFT通过统一SFT和RL，显著提升了LLM在推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决预训练数据中高质量文本稀缺的问题，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过指导性改写（guided rewrite）将低质量文档转化为有用数据，并与高质量原始文本混合使用。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合改写文本后模型性能分别提升1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点，且效果优于单纯增加原始数据量。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的扩展预训练数据的方法，具有潜力。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

*Yucheng Zhou,Lingran Song,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化多智能体框架（MAM），用于解决当前多模态医疗LLMs在知识更新成本、全面性和灵活性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一的多模态医疗LLMs存在知识更新成本高、全面性和灵活性不足的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: MAM将医疗诊断过程分解为多个专门角色（如全科医生、专科团队、放射科医生等），每个角色由基于LLM的智能体实现，形成模块化协作框架。

Result: 在多种公开的多模态医疗数据集上，MAM表现优于特定模态的LLMs，性能提升幅度为18%至365%。

Conclusion: MAM通过模块化和协作的方式，显著提升了医疗诊断的性能和灵活性，同时降低了知识更新成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自治代理如何通过通信信号自组织形成文化，以及不同通信策略对其合作和适应性的影响。

Method: 使用NEC-DAC系统，每个代理配备神经网络进行决策，分析不同社会结构（如权威层级）对文化形成的影响。

Result: 研究发现合作文化显著影响部落表现，信号不仅促进文化涌现，还支持跨代传播。

Conclusion: 通信信号在代理间协调行为和文化传播中发挥关键作用，对集体效率有积极影响。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在战略随机化中的表现，通过零和博弈实验评估了五种LLMs的策略推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有工作将随机化决策与随机生成混淆的问题，并评估LLMs在战略随机化中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种基于田忌赛马灵感的零和博弈，通过多轮比赛和不同提示风格（框架化、中立、暗示）评估LLMs的随机化决策。

Result: 结果显示，弱模型始终确定性决策，强模型在明确暗示下增加随机化；面对弱模型时，强模型采用确定性策略，面对同类时接近均衡策略。

Conclusion: LLMs在战略推理能力上存在显著差异，为抽象推理和自适应学习提供了改进空间。

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出大型推理模型（LRMs）在特定复杂度阈值后性能崩溃（推理悬崖），但评论认为这是实验限制而非认知边界，并通过工具使用证明模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LRMs的性能崩溃是否源于实验限制而非模型本身的推理能力不足。

Method: 通过工具使用和动态接口重新评估模型性能，对比静态文本范式下的结果。

Result: 工具使用后模型能解决之前无法完成的任务，甚至超越复杂度阈值。

Conclusion: LRMs的性能崩溃是接口限制导致的执行问题，而非推理能力缺陷。

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TabPFN在小到中型表格数据中的实际应用潜力，特别是在农业产量预测领域。

Method: 使用10天时间序列的EO和天气数据，按月聚合，通过留一年交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: TabPFN与ML模型精度相当，但调参更快、特征工程需求更低，实用性更强。

Conclusion: TabPFN在效率和易用性上优于传统方法，适合实际产量预测应用。

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在2D解谜游戏Baba is You中的表现，发现即使微调后，LLMs在动态规则推理上仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在结合语言能力和推理能力的任务（如动态规则解谜游戏）中的表现，以评估其复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 评估了六种LLMs，使用不同提示类型（简单、规则扩展、动作扩展），并对两种模型（Mistral、OLMo）进行微调。

Result: 较大模型（如GPT-4o）表现较好，但小模型难以理解游戏机制；微调提升了分析能力，但对解决方案生成帮助有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在动态规则推理上仍有挑战，游戏规则动态变化的任务适合测试LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康支持系统仅基于用户当前情绪和情境生成回应，导致干预效果表面化，无法满足深层情感需求。

Method: 通过整合《薄伽梵歌》的精神智慧与GPT-4o，构建GITes数据集，并引入新的Spiritual Insight指标，利用LLM作为评审框架进行评估。

Result: 最佳模型Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct在ROUGE、METEOR、BERT分数、Spiritual Insight等指标上显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合精神智慧的AI系统在提升用户满意度和支持效果方面具有潜力，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

Motivation: 旨在构建一个数学严谨的AI系统，通过竞争和信念修正实现知识的自我验证和进化。

Result: 系统证明了真理作为进化吸引子的存在，知识在对抗性认知压力下可自我验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为可计算的、自我调节的群体智能提供了理论基础，展示了真理的进化稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多粒度特性的图粗化方法GBGC，通过自适应粒度球计算显著提升了粗化效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图粗化方法主要基于谱保持视角，忽略了图的多粒度特性，导致粗化结果和效率不佳。

Method: GBGC引入自适应粒度球图细化机制，将原始图从粗到细分割为不同大小的粒度球，并以这些球为超节点构建粗化图。

Result: GBGC的处理速度比其他方法快数十到数百倍，时间复杂度更低，且粗化图的准确性通常高于原始图。

Conclusion: GBGC因其鲁棒性和泛化性，有望成为标准的图数据预处理方法。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统中的“过滤气泡”、外部知识利用不足以及模型优化与业务策略迭代脱节的问题。

Method: 1. 将用户数据和物品属性转化为LLM可理解的提示；2. 两阶段训练：SFT和GRPO（结合CoT机制）。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著提升了准确性、多样性和新颖性，有效缓解了过滤气泡效应。

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1为复杂业务目标下的推荐模型与策略集成优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

Conclusion: 情绪检测技术可有效提升日历应用的用户体验，行为方法在准确性和一致性上表现更优。

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程数据整理过程耗时且依赖人工标注，现有数据集规模有限，阻碍了LLM代理的发展。

Method: 采用增量式自动化数据整理流程，构建包含10,169个Python任务实例的数据集，并训练Skywork-SWE模型。

Result: Skywork-SWE模型在SWE-bench基准测试中达到38.0% pass@1准确率，使用测试时扩展技术后提升至47.0%。

Conclusion: 自动化数据整理流程和模型训练展示了数据规模对性能的持续提升，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a

consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG是一种新型框架，通过动态意图转移图和双检索机制，显著提升多轮客服对话的上下文连贯性和目标导向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话系统在多轮客服对话中难以同时保持上下文连贯和目标导向的问题。

Method: 构建动态意图转移图，结合意图图遍历和语义搜索的双检索机制。

Result: 在自动指标和LLM评估中显著优于传统方法，如BLEU提升11%，响应质量提升58%。

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG通过意图结构和语义检索的协同效应，有效解决了知识密集型多轮对话的挑战。

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了对象中心表示（OCR）在机器人操作任务中的潜力，并通过模拟环境中的多对象任务验证其优于整体表示的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCR研究多关注场景分解，缺乏对学习表示推理能力的评估，机器人操作任务因其多对象和交互特性成为理想测试平台。

Method: 创建了多对象、高度随机化的机器人操作任务模拟环境，并对比了经典OCR方法与整体表示方法在多种泛化场景下的表现。

Result: 现有方法在复杂场景结构中易失败，而OCR方法能有效应对这些挑战。

Conclusion: OCR在复杂机器人操作任务中展现出潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多模态讽刺理解任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的框架来整合多个LLM的能力。

Method: 提出Commander-GPT框架，通过三种集中式指挥官（轻量级编码器、小型自回归模型、大型LLM）协调多个专门化LLM代理完成任务。

Result: 在MMSD和MMSD 2.0基准测试中，F1分数平均提升4.4%和11.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Commander-GPT通过模块化设计和多代理协作，显著提升了多模态讽刺理解的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: NaviAgent是一种基于图导航的双层规划架构，通过多路径决策器和图编码导航器提升工具调用的鲁棒性和效率，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs依赖静态知识和脆弱工具调用的问题，特别是在复杂异构工具链的大规模编排中。

Method: 采用双层规划架构：多路径决策器动态选择最优动作，图编码导航器构建工具依赖异构图并集成启发式搜索策略。

Result: 在多个基础模型和任务复杂度下，NaviAgent的任务成功率最高，平均比基线方法提升13.5%-19.0%。

Conclusion: NaviAgent在工具链编排中表现出色，图编码导航器对复杂任务尤为关键。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决D&D中手动调整战斗难度的复杂性，避免打断叙事流程。

Method: 将问题建模为上下文老虎机，基于实时队伍属性生成战斗遭遇。

Result: 延长战斗时长200%，减少队伍战后生命值16.67%，提升战术深度，同时保持70%胜率。

Conclusion: NTRL在提升战斗难度和战术深度方面优于人工设计，同时保持游戏公平性。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗）中，高性能的机器学习模型通常缺乏可解释性，而符号方法虽可解释但预测能力有限。

Method: 采用FOLD-R++算法生成的ASP规则与黑盒分类器结合，选择性修正不确定预测并提供解释。

Result: 在五个医疗数据集上实验显示，该方法显著提升了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合符号推理与传统机器学习可在不牺牲准确性的前提下实现高可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: TAPAS展示了动态生成计划与机器人能力之间的有效桥梁，适应性强。

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法主要关注类增量学习，缺乏多域任务增量学习的策略，且忽视跨模态信息交换的潜力。

Method: 提出ChordPrompt框架，引入跨模态提示和域自适应文本提示，优化视觉与文本信息的交互。

Result: 在多域增量学习基准测试中，ChordPrompt在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt通过跨模态和域自适应提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的表现。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Conclusion: ISLs是推动科学发现和AI驱动科学发展的关键范式。

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

TL;DR: 本文证明了在DMGs上的C-DMGs中，do-calculus无条件地适用于识别宏观因果效应，并扩展了非可识别性的图形标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实系统中常存在循环因果动态，而传统的ADMGs无法完全捕捉这种复杂性，因此需要更通用的模型（如ioSCMs和DMGs）来支持部分指定的因果表示。

Method: 通过引入ioSCMs和DMGs，研究C-DMGs在DMGs上的宏观因果效应识别问题，并证明do-calculus的适用性。

Result: 在DMGs上的C-DMGs中，do-calculus无条件地是完备且可靠的，且非可识别性标准可扩展到部分DMGs上的C-DMGs。

Conclusion: 研究为处理循环因果动态的系统提供了理论支持，扩展了do-calculus的应用范围。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Motivation: 研究人类和动物快速适应新环境的能力，探索其背后的情景记忆机制，并利用Transformer模型模拟这一过程。

Method: 训练Transformer模型在规划任务中进行上下文强化学习，分析其学习算法和表征学习过程。

Result: 模型的学习策略不支持传统模型无关或基于模型的规划，而是通过缓存中间计算实现快速适应。其表征学习与大脑海马-内嗅系统相似。

Conclusion: 记忆可能是支持灵活行为的计算资源，研究结果对自然认知和人工智能的快速学习机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

Motivation: 尽管机器学习在预测性维护（PdM）中的应用日益增多，但模型不确定性限制了工业广泛采用。研究旨在解决预测误差对维护决策的负面影响。

Method: 提出IEO框架，结合预测模型优化与维护决策目标，开发适用于小样本数据的随机扰动梯度下降算法。

Conclusion: IEO框架通过将预测模型训练与维护目标对齐，提高了模型不确定性和决策质量，尤其适用于决策策略与目标不一致的情况。

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗文档分析提供了隐私保护、可解释且高性能的解决方案，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,

### [74] [From Reproduction to Replication: Evaluating Research Agents with Progressive Code Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19724)
*Gyeongwon James Kim,Alex Wilf,Louis-Philippe Morency,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoExperiment是一个评估AI代理在给定不同代码起点时实现和运行机器学习实验能力的基准测试，发现性能随缺失函数数量增加而下降，动态交互代理表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估AI代理在科学实验中实现科学想法的基准测试，尤其是在从部分复制到完全复制的不同起点下。

Method: 提出AutoExperiment基准测试，要求AI代理根据研究论文的自然语言描述生成缺失代码并运行实验，通过调整缺失函数数量n来调节难度。

Result: 性能随n增加迅速下降，动态交互代理优于固定框架代理，单次尝试与多次尝试成功率差距显著。

Conclusion: AutoExperiment为评估AI驱动的科学实验进展提供了新基准，揭示了长时程代码生成和自主实验执行的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动提示优化在知识图谱三元组抽取任务中的应用，通过实验评估不同设置对性能的影响，发现优化后的提示能显著提升结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计针对特定任务的提示对大型语言模型（LLM）来说耗时且脆弱，因此研究自动提示优化技术以提升三元组抽取任务的效率。

Method: 通过实验评估不同设置（如提示策略、LLM模型、模式复杂度等），比较三种自动提示优化工具（DSPy、APE、TextGrad）在SynthIE和REBEL数据集上的表现。

Result: 自动提示优化技术能生成接近人工设计的提示，并在模式复杂性和文本长度增加时显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 自动提示优化是三元组抽取任务的有效方法，尤其在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于策略引导的强化学习方法（SAGE），通过专家策略和新型奖励机制（SCS和CRS）提升查询重写的效果，显著提高了检索性能并降低了推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前查询重写方法依赖大规模监督数据或强化学习探索效率低，需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 引入策略自适应生成引擎（SAGE），结合专家策略和强化学习框架，使用SCS和CRS奖励机制优化学习信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如HotpotQA、FEVER等）中取得最优NDCG@10结果，同时减少不必要的探索并降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 策略引导的强化学习结合精细奖励机制，为信息检索系统提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

TL;DR: SimBelief是一种新的元强化学习框架，通过测量任务信念的相似性来优化稀疏奖励环境中的任务识别和探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境中，现有的Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL方法难以重建奖励信号，导致利用效率低下。

Method: 提出SimBelief框架，利用潜在任务信念度量学习相似任务的共同结构，并将其整合到特定任务信念中。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的MuJoCo和panda-gym任务上，SimBelief优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SimBelief通过提取任务分布的共性特征，实现了高效的任务识别和探索，适用于稀疏奖励环境。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决慢思考模型因无法准确识别知识边界而导致的严重幻觉问题。

Method: 提出KnowRL方法，将事实性奖励引入RL训练，指导模型基于事实进行慢思考。

Result: 在三个幻觉评估数据集和两个推理评估数据集上，KnowRL有效减少了幻觉，同时保持了推理能力。

Conclusion: KnowRL通过事实性奖励显著改善了慢思考模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code

Motivation: 由于研究人员对数据可视化原则和指南的不了解或不遵守，图表可能导致信息不准确或不完整。本研究旨在利用VLMs自动检测这些问题。

Method: 使用五种开源VLMs和五种提示策略，通过从数据可视化指南中提取的问题集，评估VLMs在分析图表中的表现。

Result: VLMs在识别图表类型、3D效果、轴标签等方面表现良好，但在图像质量和刻度标记/标签方面表现不佳。Qwen2.5VL模型和总结提示策略效果最佳。

Conclusion: VLMs可自动检测图表中的潜在问题，如缺失轴标签、图例和不必要的3D效果。该方法可扩展到其他数据可视化领域。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口拥堵预测对全球供应链的可靠性至关重要，准确的预测可以改善运输计划、减少延误和成本，并优化库存和分销策略。

Method: 通过分析历史AIS数据重建停泊计划，利用逆向强化学习（IRL）确定奖励函数，开发了Temporal-IRL模型来预测船舶序列和停泊时间。

Result: 模型在纽约/新泽西港的Maher Terminal数据上训练和测试，取得了显著的效果。

Conclusion: Temporal-IRL模型能够有效预测港口拥堵，为供应链管理提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中协同效率低和训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用GRPO联合训练，结合蒙特卡洛采样和边际效益驱动选择策略，优化智能体模型和记忆机制。

Result: 在通用和领域特定场景中，JoyAgents-R1性能接近更大规模的LLMs，但基于较小的开源模型。

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1通过高效的联合进化和记忆优化，显著提升了多智能体系统的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

TL;DR: 论文提出FairGENRec模型，利用扩散模型提升推荐系统的公平性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中，用户行为驱动的模型容易因敏感特征（如性别、年龄）的强相关性导致不公平。扩散模型因其建模不确定性和多样性的能力，适合解决这一问题。

Method: 在训练阶段，通过敏感特征识别模型注入随机噪声，并设计序列去噪模型反向重建项目；在推理阶段，利用历史交互生成噪声并通过反向迭代重构目标项目表示。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FairGENRec在准确性和公平性上均有提升，统计分析和案例可视化验证了公平性的改进程度。

Conclusion: FairGENRec通过扩散模型有效建模推荐公平性，同时提升多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著提高了LLM生成查询的准确性，同时降低了延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: HI-SQL为Text-to-SQL系统提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Result: SPLoRA在安全性和性能上优于现有技术，同时减少推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA为部署更安全可靠的LLMs提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

### [88] [Chain-of-Experts: Unlocking the Communication Power of Mixture-of-Experts Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18945)
*Zihan Wang,Rui Pan,Jiarui Yao,Robert Csordas,Linjie Li,Lu Yin,Jiajun Wu,Tong Zhang,Manling Li,Shiwei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) 是一种新的 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 架构，通过层内专家顺序通信提升模型表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 MoE 模型中专家独立并行操作，缺乏动态交互，限制了模型的表现力。CoE 旨在通过顺序专家通信和动态路由解决这一问题。

Method: CoE 在每层内引入专家链式迭代处理，每步动态路由选择专家，支持专家组合多样性。

Result: CoE 在数学推理任务中验证损失从 1.20 降至 1.12，且通过迭代深度扩展，性能优于宽度扩展策略。

Conclusion: CoE 通过迭代残差结构和动态路由提升了专家专业化与模型表现力，为模型扩展提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

*Maoyuan Li,Sihong Li,Guancheng Shen,Yun Zhang,Huamin Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种混合特征注意力-人工神经网络（MFA-ANN）模型，用于高精度在线预测注塑产品重量，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决注塑质量异常检测不及时和在线监测滞后的问题。

Method: 结合机理分析和数据驱动方法，通过分层特征提取和自注意力机制动态校准跨模态特征权重。

Result: MFA-ANN模型RMSE为0.0281，优于传统模型（如LSTM、SVR等），混合特征建模和注意力机制分别贡献22.4%和11.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为注塑过程的智能质量控制提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上运行大语言模型的高计算和内存需求限制了实时应用，现有方法如量化和剪枝仅部分优化且牺牲速度或准确性。

Method: HOLA结合分层推测解码（HSD）、自适应检索（AdaComp-RAG）和混合剪枝量化（LoBi），实现端到端优化。

Result: 在GSM8K和ARC任务上分别提升17.6%和10.5%，同时降低延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: HOLA证明其可扩展性和生产就绪性，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

Conclusion: 该方法通过知识迁移使传感器网络达到与视觉系统相当的精度，为桥梁健康监测提供了高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

Motivation: 在重症监护等动态预测任务中，传统解释性方法难以处理时间变化依赖性和时间平滑性，需要更可靠的解释性框架。

Method: 系统分析传统方法的失败模式，并提出可学习掩码框架，结合时间连续性和标签一致性约束。

Result: 可学习掩码方法在动态时间序列预测中提供了更可靠和一致的解释。

Conclusion: 可学习掩码框架适用于重症监护等动态预测任务，提供更优的解释性。

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注反事实公平性，且多应用于金融和法律领域，健康数据中的因果公平性未被充分解决。

Method: 开发了首个基于LLM增强的合成数据生成方法，利用真实世界表格健康数据，保持因果结构。

Result: 生成的数据在因果公平性指标上偏离真实数据不到10%，训练后的预测器将敏感属性偏差减少70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为公平的健康研究和医疗提供了高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created

preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio

songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of

Result: 解码器方法节省50%训练时间和35%内存，准确性高，且能捕捉物理相关性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在无需完全微调的情况下扩展新变量是一个重要质量指标，有助于资源有限的社区更广泛采用。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在数学上能够表示什么，以及如何通过构造性方法（而非数据训练）设计神经网络。

Method: 采用构造性方法设计神经网络，例如构建一个精确排序输入的神经网络，并分析其计算复杂性和参数规模。

Result: 研究表明，作为算法的神经网络通常是递归和并行的，且深度网络优于浅层网络。

Conclusion: 神经网络作为算法具有独特的优势，但其连续性和网络深度的限制也带来了挑战。

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

Result: 成功实现Lloyd算法，并通过修改架构生成多种聚类变体（如软k-means）。

Conclusion: Transformer机制能精确映射算法，为在Transformer中实现精确算法提供了清晰视角。

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

Motivation: 现有Riemannian表示学习方法依赖流形上的密度近似，优化目标复杂，可能损害模型性能。

Method: 引入Riemannian生成解码器，利用Riemannian优化器寻找流形上的最大似然潜在变量，同时训练解码网络。

Result: 在合成扩散过程、人类迁移和细胞分裂周期三个案例中，学习到的表示均符合预设几何结构并捕捉了内在非欧几里得特性。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需解码器，兼容现有架构，生成的潜在空间与数据几何一致且可解释。

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

Conclusion: Command-V为LLM行为转移提供了一种高效、低成本的替代方案。

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

Conclusion: 句子级分析为理解推理模型提供了新视角，三种方法的一致性证明了其潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

Motivation: 解决在隐私保护环境下分布式微调LLMs时的高通信成本和性能问题。

Result: 在性能上与集中式训练相当，同时显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed是一种高效且隐私保护的分布式LLMs微调解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在需要精确计算或多步代数推理的数学问题上的不足，同时避免工具集成推理（TIR）带来的可扩展性和部署问题。

Method: 构建一个Solver Agent，通过规划、符号工具调用和反思推理解决问题，并通过多LLM代理的反向翻译管道将TIR痕迹转换为自然语言推理痕迹。

Result: 实验表明，在合成的推理痕迹上微调小型开源模型，能够在不依赖工具的情况下提升竞争级数学基准的表现。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言蒸馏工具知识，LLMs可以内化工具知识和结构化推理模式，无需推理时工具访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

Conclusion: 论文证明了在差分隐私和联邦学习框架下，可以实现高效的模型个性化，并在更广泛的分布和噪声条件下提供隐私和性能保障。

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Conclusion: 高精度PINNs是研究PDEs奇点的有效工具，未来可进一步探索更高维问题的机器精度实现。

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the
universality of several recent examples from the literature on positive
definite kernels defined on Riemannian symmetric spaces, thus providing
theoretical justification for their use in applications involving
manifold-valued data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

Result: 实验表明，对冲策略能有效缓解奖励黑客，并在失真与奖励间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 对冲策略是避免过度依赖奖励信号的有效方法，HedgeTune算法在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: 全局Lipschitz正则化为行为克隆策略提供了对抗扰动的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了图OOD泛化和分类准确率。

Conclusion: CMO和NNR方法有效解决了图OOD分类中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

Motivation: 动态图中保持时间连续性至关重要，但大批次训练的MDGNNs会破坏事件序列，导致时间信息丢失和参数收敛困难。

Method: 提出BADGNN框架，包含Temporal Lipschitz Regularization（TLR）控制参数搜索空间扩展，以及Adaptive Attention Adjustment（A3）缓解注意力的失真。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，BADGNN在保持性能的同时支持更大的批次和更快的训练速度。

Conclusion: BADGNN有效解决了动态图中大批次训练的时间连续性问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Conclusion: PGNN方法在解决EOCS问题上具有高效性和准确性，适用于在线继电器设置计算。

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Conclusion: CroMoTEX通过跨模态学习提升了心电图的诊断能力，适用于实际场景中胸片不可用的情况。

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

Conclusion: DGMAE是一种有效的图自监督学习方法，特别适用于异质性图。

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进四叉树搜索（PQS）的新方法，用于高效解决电磁结构设计中的高维空间和昂贵评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁结构设计因高维设计空间和昂贵评估而具有挑战性，现有方法数据密集且难以适应实际规模和预算限制。

Method: PQS将传统图像布局转换为基于四叉树的层次表示，实现从全局模式到局部细节的渐进搜索，并引入一致性驱动的样本选择机制以减少对高精度预测器的依赖。

Result: 在双频选择表面和高增益天线任务中，PQS在有限计算预算下表现优异，比生成方法节省75-85%的评估成本，缩短设计周期20.27-38.80天。

Conclusion: PQS是一种高效且节省成本的电磁结构设计方法，适用于实际工程应用。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本超参数迁移技术（μTransfer-FNO），用于解决Fourier Neural Operators（FNOs）在处理复杂PDE时因增加傅里叶模式导致的超参数调优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNOs在处理复杂PDE时需要增加傅里叶模式，导致模型参数增多，超参数调优计算成本过高。

Method: 基于Maximal Update Parametrization（μP）框架，提出μTransfer-FNO技术，实现小规模FNOs的超参数配置直接迁移到大规模FNOs。

Result: 实验验证了μTransfer-FNO在多种PDE上的有效性，显著降低了大规模FNOs的超参数调优成本，同时保持或提升了准确性。

Conclusion: μTransfer-FNO为大规模FNOs提供了一种高效且准确的超参数迁移解决方案。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FIM的新框架，通过引导智能体对任务关键元素（CoG状态维度）的影响来增强多智能体强化学习中的合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励下的多智能体强化学习面临探索不足和协调注意力不足的挑战。

Method: FIM包括三个核心组件：识别CoG状态维度、设计反事实内在奖励、以及基于资格迹的信用积累。

Result: 在多种MARL基准测试中，FIM显著提升了合作性能。

Conclusion: FIM在稀疏奖励环境下实现了更有效的合作。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于标签的因果发现方法，通过为变量分配多个标签来提升因果关系的发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一类型的因果发现方法缺乏鲁棒性和灵活性，无法充分利用变量间的复杂关系。

Method: 首先应用现有因果发现方法定向部分边，然后利用这些边确定标签间的关系，最后用这些关系定向未定向的边。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了因果发现的效果，且标签关系符合常识。

Conclusion: 基于标签的方法比单一类型方法更灵活和鲁棒，能更好地发现因果关系。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

<details>

Motivation: Q值估计中的偏差问题会减慢Q学习和actor-critic方法的收敛速度，现代RL算法的成功部分归功于直接或间接的过估计减少机制。

Method: 在现有DRL算法基础上，通过少量代码实现局部自适应的过估计控制，并结合双Q学习进行理论验证。

Result: 在表格、Atari和MuJoCo环境中进行了实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现，能够有效减少Q值估计中的过估计问题，提升算法性能。

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MU技术快速发展，但其潜在漏洞研究不足，可能导致隐私泄露风险。现有攻击方法需访问原始模型，违背了MU的隐私保护目标。

Method: 提出MRA框架，利用教师-学生知识蒸馏架构，将ULM作为噪声标注器，转化为噪声标签学习问题。

Result: 实验表明，MRA在恢复遗忘实例的类别成员关系上高效，为未来MU漏洞研究提供了基准。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MU漏洞研究的空白，为隐私保护提供了新的视角和评估标准。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型深度学习模型在噪声标签数据上训练时性能会显著下降，目前缺乏有效的方法来恢复性能。

Method: 提出COLUR框架，采用协同训练架构，先遗忘噪声标签的影响，再通过信心导向重新学习。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，COLUR在模型恢复和优化后性能优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: COLUR框架通过遗忘和重新学习机制有效解决了噪声标签导致的模型性能下降问题。

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

Motivation: 自然出现的符号公式中变量常以固定组合出现，通过替换组合减少变量数量可提升符号回归的效率。

Method: 搜索小替换的表达式空间并验证其有效性，将有效性测试简化为功能依赖性测试。

Result: 该方法可靠地识别有效替换，显著提升了多种先进符号回归算法的性能。

Conclusion: 迭代降维方法可有效减少变量数量，提升符号回归算法的表现。

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了超参数优化（HPO）中的过度调优（overtuning）现象，即过度优化验证误差可能导致泛化性能下降，类似于模型训练中的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证误差估计具有随机性，过度优化可能导致HPO级别的过拟合（overtuning），但这一现象在文献中研究较少。

Method: 通过大规模重新分析HPO基准数据，评估overtuning的普遍性和严重性，并分析影响因素。

Result: 研究发现overtuning比预期更常见，约10%的情况下会导致泛化性能比默认配置更差。

Conclusion: 需要提高对overtuning的认识，尤其是在小数据场景下，并进一步研究缓解策略。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Result: 该方法能够找到现有CAS无法识别的ODE对称性。

Conclusion: 符号回归为ODE对称性发现提供了新的有效途径，扩展了CAS的能力。

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

<details>

Motivation: FSCIL需要在有限监督下适应新类别并保留已学知识，现有方法因原型偏差和结构固定性限制了嵌入空间的表达能力。

Method: 设计了基于海马体联想记忆的原型校准和动态结构匹配，优化特征-结构双重一致性。

Result: 在mini-ImageNet和CUB200基准测试中，ConCM性能优于现有最优方法，增量会话的调和准确率分别提升3.20%和3.68%。

Conclusion: ConCM通过几何最优性和最大匹配性克服了类别数量先验需求，为FSCIL提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Motivation: 解决新产品发布等场景中少样本时间序列预测问题，传统方法因忽视任务间通用与特定特征而表现不佳。

Method: FAF框架包含通用知识模块（GKM）、任务特定模块（TSM）和排序模块（RM），通过元学习提取通用特征，动态选择特定特征。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，FAF显著优于基线方法，尤其在CO2排放数据集上比最佳基线iTransformer提升41.81%。

Conclusion: FAF框架在少样本时间序列预测中表现出色，兼具通用性和个性化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design

Result: 发现大规模模型在全似然方法下性能显著提升，而传统统计方法下无改进。

Conclusion: DeepWAS方法通过优化模型规模和特征利用，有望提升疾病预测和治疗靶点识别的准确性。

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLieNet框架通过全局参数空间映射和动态传播网络权重映射，实现跨参数化的动态行为统一建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数变化导致模型行为差异大、难以泛化的问题。

Method: 学习参数空间到非线性嵌入的全局映射，并通过超网络生成目标网络权重。

Result: 在时间外推和参数空间插值任务中表现优异，优于或匹配现有基准。

Conclusion: PHLieNet能有效捕捉广泛参数化下的动态行为，具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归的目标不仅是预测准确，还需学习可解释的函数。传统方法通过优化基函数展开的参数难以满足这一目标，因此需要探索新的方法。

Method: 通过系统化搜索小表达式空间（即由少量子表达式组成的表达式），寻找更优的解决方案。

Result: 在基准数据集上，该方法在恢复真实符号表达式方面优于当前最先进的符号回归方法。

Conclusion: 系统化搜索小表达式空间是一种更有效的符号回归方法，尤其在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现突出。

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

Result: 实验表明，ReCalX生成的解释更符合人类感知和实际物体位置。

Conclusion: ReCalX能有效提升基于扰动的解释的可靠性，同时保持模型预测的准确性。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

Conclusion: UDG在未知任务上优于监督数据生成方法，验证了理论结论的实用性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP)，通过预防异常值形成而非事后缓解，优化大语言模型的量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的极端激活异常值严重降低量化性能，阻碍高效设备部署，需解决此问题。

Method: OSP结合三种创新：Muon优化器、Single-Scale RMSNorm和可学习嵌入投影，预防异常值形成。

Result: 训练1.4B参数模型，在4位量化下平均得分35.7（标准模型26.5），异常值接近零。

Conclusion: 异常值非大语言模型固有，而是训练策略所致，OSP为高效部署铺路。

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Conclusion: CAAT-Net能有效加速训练和推理任务。

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

Result: 实验显示方法比现有技术减少20%误分类，并扩展至自然语言处理任务。

Conclusion: 方法有效且实用，强调注释质量的重要性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Result: 实验表明，改进方法能在减少校准需求的同时，保持预测集的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了ICP的实用性，同时保持了可证明的性能。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了平均准确率，同时最小化了内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少内存占用方面表现出巨大潜力，为基于内存的持续学习算法提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

TL;DR: ReBoot是首个支持全加密、非交互式深度神经网络训练的框架，基于CKKS方案，通过本地误差信号和优化的打包策略降低计算开销，并在加密训练中达到与明文训练相当的精度。


<details>

Motivation: 数据隐私问题日益突出，需要能在不泄露敏感信息的情况下进行深度学习的方法。同态加密（HE）因其端到端数据保护能力成为关键，但现有研究主要集中在加密推理，加密训练因计算复杂性和开销大而受限。

Method: ReBoot基于CKKS方案，设计了一种HE兼容的神经网络架构，利用本地误差信号减少乘法深度和噪声积累，采用SIMD操作优化打包策略，并结合近似自举技术支持多层感知机训练。

Result: 在图像识别和表格数据任务中，ReBoot的加密训练精度与32位浮点明文训练相当，测试精度比加密逻辑回归高3.27%，比现有加密DNN框架高6.83%，训练延迟降低8.83倍。

Conclusion: ReBoot为机器学习即服务提供了高效的全加密训练解决方案，显著提升了加密DNN的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型生成的长链式推理解码速度慢，现有的token级推测解码（SD）因猜测正确率随长度指数下降而受限。

Method: 提出Lookahead Reasoning，利用轻量级草案模型预测多个未来步骤，目标模型批量扩展这些步骤，并通过验证器保留语义正确的步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME等基准测试中，加速比从1.4倍提升至2.1倍，且答案质量保持不变。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning通过步骤级并行性突破了SD的算法限制，显著提升了推理模型的解码效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

Result: OFTv2训练速度提升10倍，GPU内存使用降低3倍，且性能不降。支持量化基础模型微调，优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2在效率、内存和稳定性上显著改进，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Result: FDG在低引导强度下提升图像质量，避免高CFG强度下的过饱和和多样性下降，实验表明FDG在多个数据集和模型上均优于CFG。

Conclusion: FDG作为一种即插即用的方法，显著提升了生成样本的保真度和多样性，优于标准CFG。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

### [151] [Geometric-Aware Variational Inference: Robust and Adaptive Regularization with Directional Weight Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19726)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAP的变分框架，通过使用von Mises-Fisher分布直接在单位超球面上建模权重不确定性，解决了现有方法在神经网络几何匹配上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变分推断方法在权重空间中使用各向同性高斯近似，无法匹配神经网络的固有几何结构，导致不确定性量化效果不佳。

Method: CAP框架基于径向-方向后验分解和球形权重约束，利用von Mises-Fisher分布建模权重不确定性，并通过解析推导将vMF浓度参数与激活噪声方差联系起来。

Result: 在CIFAR-10实验中，CAP显著提高了模型校准性能（预期校准误差降低5.6倍），并提供了可解释的逐层不确定性分析。

Conclusion: CAP是一种理论严谨且实用的深度学习方法，为不确定性量化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为多扰动Shapley值分析（MSA）的模型无关框架，用于量化神经网络单元对高维输出的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法（如SHAP）无法量化神经网络单元对高维输出的贡献，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过系统性地扰动单元组合，MSA生成Shapley模式，即与模型输出维度完全一致的单元贡献图。

Result: MSA在不同规模的模型（从多层感知机到560亿参数的Mixtral-8x7B和GAN）中验证了其有效性，揭示了计算集中、语言特定专家和GAN中的像素生成层次。

Conclusion: MSA是一种强大的方法，可用于解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种新型数据预处理技术，通过物理振动分析提取数据的关键特征，显著减少输入维度并提升深度学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习的瓶颈在于输入数据的准备，传统方法在信号和噪声中学习效率低下。DRIFT旨在通过物理感知提取关键特征，优化输入。

Method: DRIFT将图像投影到基于物理振动模式的低维基上，提取紧凑且可解释的特征表示。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR100上，DRIFT仅需50-100个特征即可实现竞争性分类精度，且对批次大小、网络架构和分辨率变化不敏感。

Conclusion: DRIFT展示了物理驱动数据转换在深度学习中的潜力，将研究重点从架构设计转向输入优化。

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为噪声一致性训练（NCT）的轻量级方法，用于将新控制信号直接集成到预训练的一步生成器中，无需原始训练图像或重新训练基础扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效且可控的高质量内容生成是AIGC的核心挑战，现有方法在适应新控制条件时计算成本高。

Method: NCT通过引入适配器模块和噪声一致性损失，在生成器的噪声空间中对齐生成行为，以隐式引导模型遵循新控制信号。

Result: 实验表明，NCT在单次前向传递中实现了最先进的可控生成，超越了现有的多步和基于蒸馏的方法。

Conclusion: NCT是一种模块化、数据高效且易于部署的方法，显著提升了生成质量和计算效率。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了在$\ell_p$-球上的在线凸优化问题，分析了高维和低维情况下的最优遗憾，并探讨了FTRL算法的自适应与非自适应正则化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在不同维度条件下（$d > T$和$d \leq T$）在线凸优化的最优遗憾表现，以及FTRL算法是否需要自适应正则化才能实现最优性能。

Method: 使用FTRL算法，并分析其在不同维度条件下采用自适应和非自适应正则化的表现。

Result: 发现自适应正则化的FTRL算法在所有维度条件下都是最优的，而固定正则化则无法同时适应高维和低维情况。此外，高维情况下线性赌博问题的次线性遗憾下界被排除。

Conclusion: 自适应正则化是实现FTRL算法在任何维度条件下最优性能的关键，固定正则化无法同时适应不同维度条件。

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统正则化方法需要大量手动调参的问题，实现自动平衡模型复杂性与过拟合。

Method: 通过验证梯度动态调整正则化参数，将参数优化分为特征学习和复杂性控制两部分。

Result: 方法在神经网络中表现出高噪声容忍度和架构特异性正则化，同时与数据增强、不确定性校准等无缝集成。

Conclusion: 交叉正则化提供了一种高效、自动化的正则化方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO的新框架，扩展了DPO方法，以支持多目标和动态偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如RLHF）计算成本高且不稳定，而DPO虽轻量但假设单一静态偏好分布，限制了灵活性。

Method: 通过分类损失直接对齐语言模型，引入多偏好维度和动态插值，支持列表式偏好反馈和灵活对齐。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，该方法在静态目标上与DPO效果相当，同时更具通用性和适应性。

Conclusion: 新框架为实际部署提供了更灵活和高效的对齐解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应权重方案，用于改进物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在求解偏微分方程时的收敛性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于计算限制，PINNs通常基于有限点集优化，难以保证收敛和精度。

Method: 提出了一种新的权重方案，自适应调整损失函数中孤立点到其连续邻域的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，该权重方案能将相对$L^2$误差降至更低水平。

Conclusion: 自适应权重方案有效提升了PINNs的性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多值动态系统、推荐算法和无损压缩等场景中的预测问题，并与“苹果品尝”问题相关。

Method: 通过定义“可预测错误”标签（基于多值假设类），提出模糊预测的正确性标准。

Result: 展示了在这种设置下，假设类的最优错误界限存在三分法：Theta(1)、Theta(sqrt(N))或N。

Conclusion: 模糊在线学习为多值预测问题提供了新的理论框架，并揭示了错误界限的三分法规律。

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

Motivation: 艺术策展依赖人类专家的主观判断，缺乏明确规则。研究旨在通过机器学习模仿人类策展，探索AI在艺术领域的应用潜力。

Method: 基于大都会艺术博物馆25年的展览数据，开发四种机器学习模型，通过特征工程和模型架构设计，模仿人类策展人的选择。

Result: 模型在复制历史展览时表现优于随机选择，小规模模型与大型语言模型（如GPT）表现相当。

Conclusion: AI模型能有效模仿人类策展，未来数据增加后可进一步提升其美学和策展判断能力。

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

Motivation: 探究语言模型从训练到部署分布的行为泛化机制，特别是微调导致的‘突发性错位’现象。

Method: 采用‘模型差异’方法，通过稀疏自编码器比较微调前后模型内部表征，并测试多种微调条件（如强化学习、合成数据集）。

Result: 发现‘错位人格’特征（如毒性人格特征）是突发性错位的主要控制因素，且少量良性样本微调可恢复模型对齐。

Conclusion: 揭示了语言模型突发性错位的机制，并提出了有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ML-NIDS依赖同质数据集，性能被高估且泛化能力不足，需结合领域知识提升检测多样性攻击的能力。

Method: 提出KnowML框架，利用大型语言模型分析攻击实现并构建知识图谱，通过符号推理生成知识增强输入。

Result: 在28种攻击变体上测试，基线模型F1分数低至0%，而KnowML达到99%且误报率低于0.1%。

Conclusion: KnowML通过知识引导显著提升ML-NIDS的检测能力，为多样化攻击检测提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (ML-NIDS), their capability to detect diverse attack variants
remains uncertain. Prior studies have largely relied on homogeneous datasets,
which artificially inflate performance scores and offer a false sense of
security. Designing systems that can effectively detect a wide range of attack
variants remains a significant challenge. The progress of ML-NIDS continues to
depend heavily on human expertise, which can embed subjective judgments of
system designers into the model, potentially hindering its ability to
generalize across diverse attack types.
  To address this gap, we propose KnowML, a framework for knowledge-guided
machine learning that integrates attack knowledge into ML-NIDS. KnowML
systematically explores the threat landscape by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to perform automated analysis of attack implementations. It
constructs a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of attack strategies, on which it
applies symbolic reasoning to generate KG-Augmented Input, embedding domain
knowledge directly into the design process of ML-NIDS.
  We evaluate KnowML on 28 realistic attack variants, of which 10 are newly
collected for this study. Our findings reveal that baseline ML-NIDS models fail
to detect several variants entirely, achieving F1 scores as low as 0 %. In
contrast, our knowledge-guided approach achieves up to 99 % F1 score while
maintaining a False Positive Rate below 0.1 %.

Conclusion: 低成本特征和通用分类器在检测新型机器人方面具有潜力。

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

Motivation: 解决用户在使用LLM时面临的数据隐私与模型性能的权衡问题。

Method: 采用Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning，先由强大LLM生成子查询，再通过加密搜索本地数据，最后由本地模型生成结果。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准上，结合GPT-4o与本地Llama-3.2-1B模型的性能优于单独使用GPT-4o 7.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法为分解任务并保护隐私的混合系统提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文是一篇关于自适应异常检测（AAD）在信息物理系统（CPS）中的系统性文献综述（SLR），总结了2013年至2023年的研究进展，并提出了新的分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代网络攻击在CPS中快速演变，现有方法难以有效应对，因此需要研究自适应异常检测技术。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述，收集并分析了397篇相关论文中的65篇（47篇研究论文和18篇综述论文），提出了一种新的分类法。

Result: 研究发现，现有工作通常只关注数据处理或模型适应中的单一方面，而很少同时兼顾两者。

Conclusion: 本文旨在帮助研究人员推动AAD领域的发展，并为实践者提供最新研究进展的参考，同时指出了当前研究的局限性并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot
be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on
characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most
promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data
processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature
extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field.
We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and
systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD
in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy
considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,
and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed
works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model
adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to
advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with
recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the
art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面分析了联邦学习系统中基于网络拓扑的隐私泄露问题，揭示了不同攻击场景下的敏感数据分布模式推断能力，并提出了结构噪声注入作为防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私研究主要关注基于梯度的攻击，而网络拓扑知识的隐私影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过系统评估4,720个攻击实例，分析了六种不同的对抗知识场景，并提出了三种攻击向量。

Result: 在完全知识条件下，攻击成功率分别为84.1%、65.0%和47.2%；80%的部分知识场景仍保持攻击有效性。

Conclusion: 网络拓扑是联邦学习系统中的基本隐私漏洞，但通过拓扑感知防御机制可有效缓解。

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to
address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy
research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network
topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first
comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic
adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying
degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns
even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic
evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial
knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge
configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three
complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter
magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success
rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.
Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain
attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge
configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete
knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and
empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense
mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional
attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These
results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy
vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways
for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

### [168] [WebGuard++:Interpretable Malicious URL Detection via Bidirectional Fusion of HTML Subgraphs and Multi-Scale Convolutional BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19356)
*Ye Tian,Zhang Yumin,Yifan Jia,Jianguo Sun,Yanbin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WebGuard++ 是一个恶意 URL 检测框架，通过融合 URL 和 HTML 特征，解决了现有方法的四个关键缺陷，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意 URL 检测方法存在 URL 建模不完整、HTML 图稀疏、单向分析和决策不透明等问题，WebGuard++ 旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: WebGuard++ 包含四个组件：跨尺度 URL 编码器、子图感知 HTML 编码器、双向耦合模块和投票模块，分别解决 URL 建模、HTML 图稀疏、特征交互和决策透明性问题。

Result: 实验表明，WebGuard++ 在固定 FPR 下，TPR 比现有方法提高了 1.1x-7.9x。

Conclusion: WebGuard++ 通过多组件协同工作，显著提升了恶意 URL 检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection,
since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers
from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to
jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity,
where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid
benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3)
unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction;
and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To
address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4
novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns
local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network
with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs
into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via
Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and
HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing
inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module:
Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph
predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of
0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivacyXray框架通过分析LLM内部状态检测隐私泄露，解决了隐私提取攻击无法验证准确性的问题，平均准确率达92.69%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在敏感领域广泛应用，隐私提取攻击暴露其漏洞，但缺乏公开数据集验证准确性，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出PrivacyXray框架，利用语义一致性和概率确定性，通过四种指标检测隐私泄露。

Result: 实验显示PrivacyXray平均准确率92.69%，优于现有方法20.06%。

Conclusion: PrivacyXray解决了隐私检测的关键挑战，具有稳定性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为特征差分隐私（FDP）的新框架，用于在特定属性需要隐私保护时提高数据效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私（DP）在仅需保护特定属性时会降低数据效用，因此需要更灵活的隐私定义。

Method: 提出FDP框架，支持添加/删除和替换隐私变体，并适应性地分离保护和非保护特征。修改DP-SGD算法以满足FDP。

Result: 在AFHQ数据集上训练扩散模型时，FID从286.7显著提升至101.9（ε=8）。

Conclusion: FDP框架在保持强隐私保证的同时，显著减少了DP的效用损失。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis.
Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for
specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in
such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,
we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework
that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is
simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants
of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and
non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive
composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference
attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that
satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via
sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show
that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public
features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ
dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to
DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a
training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a
new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of
DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

<details>

Motivation: 解决量子硬件部署中的噪声和资源限制问题，以及变分量子算法中的梯度估计瓶颈。

Result: 在噪声量子数据任务中优于量子卷积神经网络，经典图像分类任务中表现接近经典神经网络。

Conclusion: IQFMs为量子增强机器学习提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against
environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable
(CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework
based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its
potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation
in realistic CV quantum systems.

Result: 在MNIST等数据集上表现优于量子自编码器，分类任务准确率超过99%，且抗攻击能力更强。

Conclusion: qPGA为量子机器学习提供了高效、抗噪声和抗攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

Result: 在基准优化任务中，COM-QEL比原始QEL找到更高真实目标值的解决方案。

Conclusion: COM-QEL在离线设计问题中表现优越，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

Motivation: 解决传统静态拍卖机制在动态市场中的局限性，适应未知且持续变化的市场环境。

Result: 学习到的在线机制渐近收敛于近似满足效率、真实性和个体理性的动态机制，并实现多种遗憾性能保证。

Conclusion: 动态VCG机制在未知动态市场中具有高效性和鲁棒性，适用于连续拍卖场景。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

Conclusion: BiLSTM-PINN是电力电子仿真的潜在替代方案，兼具速度和准确性。

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

Conclusion: 该架构有望成为分子构象生成的新型基础模型。

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

Result: 在分布匹配、语义对齐、时间对齐和音频质量方面达到公开模型的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Kling-Foley通过多模态整合和高质量编解码器，实现了视频匹配音频的高效生成。

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动将正则表达式转换为特定模式语言（如DPL）成本高且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合规则和GPT-4优化转换，部分转换采用尽力而为策略。

Result: 成功转换73.7%的正则表达式，优化后的F1-score和MCC超过0.91。

Conclusion: Reptile为迁移到现代日志分析平台提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

### [181] [First-Order Sparse Convex Optimization: Better Rates with Sparse Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19075)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用稀疏更新实现线性收敛的方法，显著降低了高维问题的运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对稀疏最优解的凸优化问题，现有方法虽然能实现线性收敛，但每次迭代的运行时间仍然很高。本文旨在通过稀疏更新改进运行时间。

Method: 提出了一种仅依赖稀疏更新的方法，同时保持线性收敛率。

Result: 实现了依赖改进条件数的线性收敛，且运行时间显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅收敛速度快，还易于实现，适用于高维稀疏优化问题。

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a
sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise
sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an
improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$,
where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient,
$\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity
of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these
methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards
improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively
high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear
convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be
obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly
improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to
implement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经3D重建（N3DR）和小型无人机（UAV）系统的方法，用于精细3D数字重建静态小物体，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型无人机在室内和难以到达区域的部署潜力增加，但其飞行动力学和功耗问题限制了自主性和任务能力。

Method: 设计并评估了一个基于N3DR的流程，利用Instant-ngp、Nerfacto和Splatfacto等先进模型，通过小型无人机拍摄的图像提升3D重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，N3DR增强的流程显著优于传统的运动结构（SfM）算法，支持高精度3D映射和异常检测。

Conclusion: N3DR技术有望推动小型无人机系统的能力提升。

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TLG的线性特性限制了其分类能力，需要网络完成复杂任务。receptron通过非线性输入依赖权重函数解决了这一问题。

Method: 提出receptron模型，利用非线性输入依赖权重函数，在3D立方域内对模拟输入表现出选择性激活特性，并可扩展到n维空间。

Result: receptron在单单元情况下显著提升分类性能，适用于多维应用，且无需复杂训练。

Conclusion: receptron网络有望成为新型设备，适用于边缘应用，具备高选择性和分类能力。

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

Motivation: 解决粒子物理模型构建中依赖理论家直觉和大量手动工作的问题。

Method: 利用强化学习代理与物理软件管道交互，选择对称群、粒子内容和群表示分配。

Result: 在已知理论空间验证了方法，并探索了一个新的对称群。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到其他理论模型构建问题。

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor
mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's
construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires
considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field
representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data.
We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a
reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software
pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups,
particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable
models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate
our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration
to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the
context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning
with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical
model-building problems in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图数据库系统仅支持一阶关系，无法满足高阶交互需求（如子图计数、多元建模等），亟需扩展支持。

Method: 引入提升和降低范式，设计轻量级、模块化且可并行化的HO-GDB原型，支持超图、节点元组等结构，并提供统一API。

Result: 原型系统在大规模高阶OLTP和OLAP任务中表现优异，例如将图神经网络的准确性提升44%。

Conclusion: HO-GDBs在保证低延迟和高吞吐的同时，扩展了传统图数据库的功能，适用于ACID和最终一致性系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BIRD-CRITIC基准和Six-Gym训练环境，用于提升开源模型在SQL问题调试中的能力，并通过Bird-Fixer代理实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂SQL问题在现实数据库应用中仍是瓶颈，现有LLMs在SQL调试任务上缺乏严格评估。

Method: 提出BIRD-CRITIC基准和Six-Gym训练环境，采用SQL-Rewind策略和f-Plan Boosting方法。

Result: Bird-Fixer在BIRD-CRITIC-PG和BIRD-CRITIC-Multi上分别达到38.11%和29.65%的成功率，超越主流专有模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为开源模型提供了强大的SQL调试能力，推动了技术民主化。

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

Motivation: 现有雷达信号恢复ECG的方法依赖高质量信号和大量数据，限制了在新场景中的应用。

Method: 使用CFT算法精确跟踪心脏位置，提出RFcardi模型利用心脏特征的稀疏性，仅需少量雷达-ECG对进行微调。

Result: CFT能动态定位心脏，RFcardi模型在少量数据训练后能有效恢复ECG。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺的新场景中具有潜力，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

Motivation: 令牌通信（TC）在远程AI生成内容（AIGC）和无线LLM应用中至关重要，但由于令牌间的语义依赖，单个令牌的丢失会严重扭曲消息语义。

Method: 提出SemPA-Look框架，结合残差语义分数（RSS）和前瞻搜索算法，以线性复杂度优化令牌分组。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SemPA-Look在保持高令牌相似性的同时，计算复杂度降低了40倍。

Conclusion: SemPA-Look在远程AIGC和其他TC应用中具有实用性，显著优于其他线性复杂度算法。

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

Result: 在小蛋白质上验证了该方法，表明仅需构象样本即可生成高质量的粗粒化力。

Conclusion: 基于标准化流的核方法显著改善了MLCG力场的校准，为缺乏原子力数据的情况提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time
scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG
beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a
promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular
dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on
force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with
corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not
recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing
datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force
matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference
atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields
which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local
distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this
work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that
substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global
conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing
that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from
configurational samples.

Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger

limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw
insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a
viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the
instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve
the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the
Mori--Zwanzig formalism.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种交互式系统，用于优化大规模科学合作中的计算和存储需求，通过分析真实数据并开发生成式AI模型来模拟任务负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型科学合作项目（如ATLAS、Belle II等）产生海量数据，现有数据管理和任务分配方法效率不足，缺乏动态模型来评估和改进替代方案。

Method: 利用PanDA工作流管理系统的任务执行记录，识别关键性能指标，并开发生成式AI模型模拟任务负载的时间序列。

Result: 确定了排队时间、错误率和远程数据访问等关键指标，并构建了包含可见和隐藏特征的任务负载模型。

Conclusion: 研究为优化大规模科学合作的计算和存储需求提供了动态模型和AI驱动的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Abstract: Predicting the probability of default (PD) of prospective loans is a critical
objective for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning (ML)
algorithms have achieved remarkable success across a wide variety of prediction
tasks; yet, they remain relatively underutilised in credit risk analysis. This
paper highlights the opportunities that ML algorithms offer to this field by
comparing the performance of five predictive models-Random Forests, Decision
Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost-to the predominantly used
logistic regression, over a benchmark dataset from Scheule et al. (Credit Risk
Analytics: The R Companion). Our findings underscore the strengths and
weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights into the most effective

Motivation: 准确建模整个大气层对于理解重力波的传播及其对上层大气动力学的影响至关重要。

Method: 利用Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO)捕捉全球尺度大气动力学，并采用模块化架构分离核心动力学与示踪剂预测。

Result: CAM-NET在精度上与WACCM-X相当，但推理速度快1000倍以上，且能高效预测关键大气参数。

Conclusion: CAM-NET通过模块化设计实现了高效准确的预测，适用于特定示踪剂场景，无需重新训练整个模型。

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model
designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to
the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate
modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward
propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and
coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier
Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while
preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets
from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to
WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide
one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively
predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,
temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling
approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET
introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction
from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary
physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables
are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for
efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational
cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this
approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 该框架结合实时目标检测与深度OCR，为智能交通系统中的碳排放监测提供了可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上显著优于现有方法，能有效处理复杂拓扑并保持全局路径一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖大量先验知识，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Conclusion: DiffRIS通过预训练扩散模型和自适应框架，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的挑战，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

Conclusion: 该方法通过循环特征提取和立体注意力机制，显著提升了CT报告生成的准确性和有效性。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.

rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LVLMs在图像描述中的偏见问题，包括多模态偏见导致的描述不平衡和语言偏见导致的虚假描述。

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现优异，生成的描述更准确、平衡且信息丰富。

Conclusion: ScaleCap通过逐步增加推理成本，显著提升了图像描述的质量和多样性。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在零样本情感识别中依赖的视觉线索是否具有心理学基础，还是仅通过表面学习获得。

Method: 通过基准测试不同规模的VLMs在AffectNet数据集上的表现，并分析GPT-4o的内部推理机制。

Result: 发现牙齿可见性影响性能，GPT-4o依赖面部属性（如眉毛位置）进行情感推理，表现出高度内部一致性。

Conclusion: 基础模型的行为具有涌现性，但也存在捷径学习、偏见和公平性问题，尤其在心理健康和教育等敏感领域。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于小型稀有野生动物（如草原犬鼠）在生态中的重要性与其难以检测的特性（如体型小、分布稀疏）之间的矛盾，现有检测方法效果不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 提出RareSpot框架，包括多尺度一致性学习（通过特征金字塔增强细粒度表示）和上下文感知增强（合成具有挑战性的训练样本）。

Result: 在草原犬鼠无人机影像基准测试中，检测精度比基线方法提高35%以上，且在其他野生动物数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: RareSpot为复杂空中场景中小型稀有物种的检测提供了新方法，支持生态监测并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查需求的增加，诊断错误的问题日益突出，而现有的医学视觉问答（VQA）基准缺乏临床相关性，无法评估专家级知识。

Method: 通过VQA框架设计MedErr-CT基准，包含六类错误（四种视觉相关错误和两种词汇错误），并分为分类、检测和纠正三个任务级别。

Result: 评估了先进的3D医学MLLMs，发现它们在不同错误类型上的表现差异显著。

Conclusion: MedErr-CT有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误并提高临床实践中的准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临高内存和计算成本的问题，难以同时实现高性能和高效率。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最先进性能，且能高效处理超过10,000帧的视频。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新的稀疏化技术，成功解决了长视频理解中的性能与效率平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,

Result: 在3D AffordanceNet数据集上，LM-AD在准确率和平均IoU上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LM-AD通过改进对齐机制，显著提升了3D点云功能检测的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Conclusion: GLCANet为实际遥感应用提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Result: 显著降低分布差距（KID指标），EDM2扩散模型FID降低11%，ViT-S分类模型在ImageNet-100上准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: 为缺乏大规模真实数据时的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Conclusion: Surgery-R1通过创新的数据集和微调机制，显著提升了手术场景中的推理能力，为临床应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and
dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

Motivation: kVCT图像中的伪影影响临床决策，传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，通过特征重校准减少伪影并保留解剖结构，生成高质量的MVCT类重建图像。

Result: 模型在定性和定量评估中表现优异，减少了重复高剂量MVCT扫描的需求，降低了患者辐射暴露。

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS框架为临床提供了可靠的kVCT图像重建方法，优化了放疗计划流程。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Result: 定制预训练在胎儿超声任务中表现优异，且无需超参数调优或方法创新。

Conclusion: 在资源有限时，应避免过度追求方法创新，直接使用现有计算机视觉方法预训练定制基础模型。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MambaOutRS-t（24.0M参数）在UC Merced和AID上分别达到98.41%和95.99%的F1分数。

Conclusion: MambaOutRS通过门控卷积和频域模块的组合，为高效深度学习模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种LVLMs上平均AUROC提升4%-10%，优于五种基线不确定性指标。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LVLMs的视觉幻觉检测能力，尤其在关系推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种检测和识别人脸识别系统中后门攻击的新方法，能够有效发现自然物理触发器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击通过隐藏触发器在输入中激活异常行为，威胁高安全性应用的人脸识别系统。

Method: 提出一种新技术，用于检测后门攻击并识别自然物理触发器。

Result: 在受攻击的人脸识别网络中，识别触发器的Top-5准确率达74%，优于基线方法（56%）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对自然物理触发器的后门攻击，提升人脸识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的时间序列多光谱图像重建框架，结合SAR数据，显著提升了云覆盖区域的图像重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云覆盖导致多光谱图像数据缺失或损坏，影响早期作物测绘，而SAR数据虽不受云干扰但缺乏足够的光谱细节。

Method: 利用时间序列多光谱图像和SAR数据的互补信息，通过Vision Transformer的注意力机制重建云覆盖区域的多光谱图像。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在云覆盖区域的多光谱图像重建效果显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的Time-series ViT框架有效解决了云覆盖问题，为早期作物测绘提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable
object and motion representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEVLM是一种并行编码策略，旨在提高视觉语言模型（VLM）在长视频理解中的效率，无需微调模型。它通过分块处理输入、保留全注意力位置嵌入和对齐注意力权重，显著降低了计算复杂度并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了视觉语言模型在长视频理解中的应用，因此需要一种高效的方法来提升预填充效率。

Method: PEVLM将输入分块处理，保留全注意力位置嵌入，并通过对齐注意力权重模拟全注意力分布，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，PEVLM比现有方法提升了8.37%的准确率，计算速度提升了7.47倍，端到端延迟降低了40%。在严格延迟约束下，准确率从23.26%提升至61.03%。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解中表现出色，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Motivation: 解决医学超声图像因参数差异导致的视觉变异性问题，并满足非专业用户（如即时护理场景）对超声解释和扫描指导的需求。

Method: 通过Transformer一阶段方法计算超声图像场景图（SG），结合LLMs生成用户友好的图像解释，并利用SG指导扫描缺失解剖结构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强超声的可解释性和指导功能，有望推动超声技术的普及化。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future
work.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Radial Attention的稀疏注意力机制，通过模拟时空能量衰减现象，显著降低了视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型在长视频生成中计算成本过高，作者发现时空注意力分数随距离衰减的现象，并基于此提出高效解决方案。

Method: 提出Radial Attention，一种复杂度为O(n log n)的稀疏注意力机制，通过静态注意力掩码实现空间和时间上的衰减计算密度。

Result: 实验表明，Radial Attention在多个数据集上保持视频质量，计算速度提升1.9倍，支持生成长度扩展4倍，训练成本降低4.4倍。

Conclusion: Radial Attention是一种高效且可扩展的注意力机制，显著提升了视频扩散模型的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

TL;DR: DFM（Decomposable Flow Matching）是一种简单有效的渐进式生成视觉媒体的框架，通过独立应用Flow Matching在多尺度表示中，显著提升了图像和视频的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维视觉模态生成计算密集，现有方法复杂且需定制化设计。DFM旨在简化流程并提升效果。

Method: DFM在多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每个层级独立应用Flow Matching。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k 512px上，DFM的FDD分数比基础架构提升35.2%，比最佳基线提升26.4%，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: DFM以单一模型、简单架构和最小改动实现了显著优势。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Motivation: 现有MSFP综述多局限于单一任务或视角，难以直接惠及相关领域研究者，本文旨在提供更全面的技术视角。

Result: 系统梳理了MSFP的多样技术方法，并探讨了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了MSFP的重要进展概览，并为未来研究提供了潜在启示。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

Conclusion: NCA在自组织系统中具有广泛应用的潜力，设计修改和训练约束对其性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular
Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex
behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring
precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that
challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and
training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs
applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing
systems.

Motivation: 由于脉冲神经网络（SNN）在处理事件驱动的神经形态数据时存在过拟合问题，且现有数据集规模有限，梯度不匹配问题严重制约了其泛化性能。

Method: 提出时间正则化训练（TRT）方法，通过时间依赖性正则化机制对早期时间步施加更强约束，并结合Fisher信息分析验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，TRT能有效缓解过拟合，平滑训练损失曲面，并在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100、ImageNet100等）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT通过时间衰减的正则化机制，引导网络在信息丰富的早期时间步学习鲁棒特征，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有多代理系统因封闭设计缺乏定制化，无法全面支持残障用户，导致数字环境交互障碍。

Method: 开发MATE系统，支持多种模型（如LLM API和自定义ML分类器），并引入ModCon-Task-Identifier模型进行任务识别。

Result: MATE可广泛应用于医疗等领域，ModCon-Task-Identifier在自定义数据上优于其他模型。

Conclusion: MATE通过灵活性和本地运行保障隐私，为残障用户提供有效支持，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积去噪自编码器在恢复高频细节（如牙科X光片中的细微解剖结构）方面表现不佳，而现有注意力机制可能忽略噪声区域的关键特征。

Method: 提出噪声感知自注意力方法，并构建噪声感知注意力增强去噪自编码器（NAADA）网络。

Result: 与现有方法（如Uformer、MResDNN）相比，NAADA在恢复高频细节和提升图像质量方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 噪声感知自注意力方法有效提升了牙科X光片的去噪效果，尤其在高频细节恢复方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

Conclusion: FLIR模型为心脏图像配准提供了一种快速、轻量且高精度的解决方案，适合临床和研究应用。

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种归一化哈希编码器和映射一致性初始化策略，以解决CBCT重建中局部-全局优化不匹配问题，从而提升训练稳定性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT重建因投影数据有限而成为病态问题，现有NeRF方法因哈希编码器与神经网络的局部-全局训练不匹配导致特征不一致，影响训练稳定性和重建效果。

Method: 引入归一化哈希编码器增强特征一致性，并提出映射一致性初始化策略，利用预训练模型的全局映射特性初始化神经网络。

Result: 方法在128个CT案例上验证，覆盖7个解剖区域，显著提升训练效率和重建性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，仅需少量代码即可显著改善CBCT重建的训练稳定性和质量。

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“教学提示”的理论框架，旨在帮助学生有效使用大语言模型（LLM）提升学习效果。通过调查和用户研究，验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在教育中的应用增加，学生对其（误）使用可能影响学习效果，因此需要一种方法指导学生如何有效利用LLM。

Method: 通过调查教师（N=36）了解需求，设计并开发了一个基于场景的交互式学习干预系统，并通过用户研究（N=22）评估其效果。

Result: 研究显示，学生在LLM教学提示技能上有显著提升，并对系统持积极态度。

Conclusion: 教学提示框架和干预设计具有推广潜力，可整合到工具中以促进学习导向的生成式AI使用。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

Conclusion: HARPT作为公共资源发布，支持健康信息学、网络安全和自然语言处理研究。

Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store
reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset
comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture
critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy
concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as
defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes
of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability
with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual
labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using
transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully
curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model
development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification
models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a
baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support
work in health informatics, cybersecurity, and natural language processing.

Result: VLMs在常见物体识别中表现良好，但对新颖表示泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 研究为实际部署基础模型于机器人提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人模仿学习中，演示数据的质量和组成对策略性能至关重要，但如何量化单个演示对闭环任务成功的影响仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出CUPID方法，利用影响函数理论估计每个训练演示对策略预期回报的影响，从而筛选和优化数据。

Result: 实验表明，CUPID能显著提升策略性能，仅用33%的精选数据即可达到最佳效果，并在硬件实验中验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CUPID为机器人模仿学习提供了一种高效的数据整理方法，能够显著提升策略性能并适应分布变化。

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

Conclusion: AnchorDP3框架有望实现完全自主的视觉运动策略生成，无需人类演示。

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

Abstract: As labor shortages and productivity stagnation increasingly challenge the

transportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned construction
sites. Our system, based on the CD110R-3 crawler carrier, integrates autonomous
navigation, fleet management, and GNSS-based localization to facilitate
material transport in construction site environments. While the current system
does not yet incorporate dynamic environment adaptation algorithms, we have
begun fundamental investigations into external-sensor based perception and
mapping system. Preliminary results highlight the potential challenges,
including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under
construction-specific conditions, and sensor placement optimization for
improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction
ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site
conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper
provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction
automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于TTS系统评估的主观指标（如MOS）难以比较，而客观指标缺乏与主观指标的有效验证，且现有指标难以区分高质量合成语音与真实语音，因此需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出了TTSDS2，一种改进的TTS评估指标，并通过多语言和多领域的数据集验证其有效性。

Result: TTSDS2在多个领域和语言中表现最佳，Spearman相关系数均高于0.50，并发布了包含11,000+主观评分的数据集和持续更新的多语言基准。

Conclusion: TTSDS2是一种更可靠的TTS评估指标，适用于高质量合成语音的评估，并提供了相关资源支持未来研究。

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

Motivation: 传统方法在多声源场景下定位性能不足，需要更鲁棒的技术。

Method: 使用α稳定模型描述信号，结合Neural Steerer插值导向向量，优化空间度量估计。

Result: 在多个声源情况下，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多声源定位中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

Motivation: 现有音频深度伪造检测数据集缺乏多样化的口音，尤其是南亚口音，导致模型在多样化语言和文化背景下表现不佳。

Method: 创建了IFD数据集，包含50名印度英语使用者的真实和伪造音频，并进行了基线模型评估。

Result: IFD在性能上优于ASVspoof21 (DF)，且比ITW数据集更具挑战性。

Conclusion: IFD填补了数据集的空白，为音频深度伪造检测提供了更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,
particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes
machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.
This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment
on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or
interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and
application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous
treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as
they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect
estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual
treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This
study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and
reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two
meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different
company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.
Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the
time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows
the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

Conclusion: 该方法为评估未测量混杂因素提供了实用工具，特别是在二元风险因素场景下。

Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk
factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has
incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by
utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined
individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption,
developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is
essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on
binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the
strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk
factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis
that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging
from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we
propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted
confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study
2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking
method.

Conclusion: 扩散模型既能记忆训练样本，也能生成新样本，其行为在简化设置下得到验证。

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the
theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is
when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on
the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow
ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For
intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal
datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training
point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion
time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.
This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training
samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,
motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these
results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,
confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training
points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number
of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal
posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their
hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic
dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with
either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are
dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show
that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at
the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is
unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions,
including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These
results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and
provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in
high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

Motivation: 探讨ABP的算法难度来源，尤其是典型解与非典型解之间的矛盾现象，以及LE在其中的作用。

Method: 利用随机对偶理论（RDT）及其升级版（sfl LD RDT）构建通用框架，分析LE作为ABP的非典型特征。

Result: 发现LE在α∈(0.77,0.78)区间内崩溃，与现有最佳ABP求解器的处理范围（α∼0.75-0.77）高度吻合。

Conclusion: LE的行为可能是ABP计算间隙存在的关键反映，为理解算法难度提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated
\emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness.
Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a
universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist
even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance
(\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of
rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them
have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or
breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are
predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete
defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows
studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,
sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features
characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a
generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the
second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching
those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we
obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which
basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers
can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among
key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks
$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in
[1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He
initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive
high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most
by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth.
In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably,
the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between
the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$,
the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where
$g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p +
1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant
aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Motivation: 理解在线搜索行为的时间模式对实时营销和趋势预测至关重要，但Google Trends数据的高维性和噪声带来了聚类挑战。

Method: 评估了SAX、eSAX和TDA三种方法在20个Google Trends关键词上的聚类效果。

Result: SAX和eSAX对稳定时间序列快速且可解释，但对复杂数据表现不佳；TDA通过持久同调捕捉全局结构，聚类更平衡且有意义。

Conclusion: 建议结合符号和拓扑方法的混合方法在消费者分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for
real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy
for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series
data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three
unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX),
enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google
Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that
while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time
series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous
``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features
through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful
groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological
methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both
perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm
that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof
for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps
in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for
\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian
kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in
\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with
differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper
\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without
any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a
continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the
trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies
the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of
\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}
convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric
and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate
characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by
Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in
\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is
more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it
uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is
different.

### [254] [Uncovering Conceptual Blindspots in Generative Image Models Using Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19708)
*Matyas Bohacek,Thomas Fel,Maneesh Agrawala,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统方法，通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别生成图像模型中的“概念盲点”，即训练数据中存在但模型生成中缺失或错误的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成图像模型在大规模数据集上表现优异，但在生成某些简单概念（如人手或四件物品）时频繁失败，这些失败模式是否反映模型的结构性限制尚不明确。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）提取可解释的概念嵌入，定量比较真实图像与生成图像中概念的普遍性。训练了一个包含32,000个概念的RA-SAE，用于精细分析概念差异。

Result: 应用于四种流行生成模型（Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, Kandinsky），揭示了特定被抑制的盲点（如鸟食器、DVD光盘）和夸大的盲点（如木质背景纹理）。

Conclusion: 提出了一个理论框架，通过评估生成模型与数据生成过程的概念保真度，系统识别其概念盲点。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

TL;DR: MoLE是一种新型架构，通过结合共享和语言特定的LoRA模块，平衡了多语言编程的效率和专业性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言编程中单一模型效率低或专用模型成本高的问题。

Method: 使用基础模型、共享LoRA模块和语言特定LoRA模块的联合优化。

Result: MoLE在参数效率上优于专用模型，在准确性上优于共享模型。

Conclusion: MoLE在多语言编程任务中实现了效率与专业性的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环状DNA（eccDNA）在癌症中起关键调控作用，但现有模型无法高效处理其全长序列。

Method: 结合正向和反向传递的全上下文表示学习，并通过新颖的增强策略保留环状结构，具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现出色，支持长达200 Kbp的序列。

Conclusion: eccDNAMamba为环状基因组建模提供了高效且鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream
analysis. Existing genomic models are either limited to single-nucleotide
resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention
mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and
efficient framework for modeling circular genomes. Our codes are available at

Result: 明确了AI Safety与AI Security的边界及其相互影响，如安全漏洞可能导致安全问题。

Conclusion: 澄清术语有助于精准研究方向、跨学科合作、政策制定及可信AI系统的部署。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical
systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While
its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes
interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to
demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate
these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise
research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,
enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of
trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 计算机科学课程学生人数激增导致大班教学中学生与教师及学习内容的互动不足，技术发展为利用CAI提升互动提供了机会。

Method: 在软件工程大班课程中设计使用ChatGPT的课堂活动，并进行有无CAI工具的对比实验。

Result: 使用CAI（ChatGPT）的课堂活动显著提升了学生对学习内容的参与度。

Conclusion: CAI工具如ChatGPT在大班教学中具有提升学生互动与参与度的潜力，值得进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the
implications of our findings.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在社会模拟中的潜力与局限，提出明确边界以提升其科学价值。

Method: 分析LLM的局限性，提出三个关键边界问题（对齐性、一致性、鲁棒性），并给出实用建议和检查清单。

Result: LLM模拟更适合研究集体模式而非个体轨迹，需验证行为与真实数据的对齐性，并确保鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM社会模拟需谨慎界定范围，结合验证方法，才能为社会科学提供可靠贡献。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.
