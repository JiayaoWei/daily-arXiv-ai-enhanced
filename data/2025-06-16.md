Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个电信运营调度评估基准TeleEval-OS，用于评估大语言模型在复杂电信任务中的表现，发现开源模型在特定场景下优于闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信运营调度任务复杂且缺乏评估基准，阻碍了大语言模型在该领域的应用潜力探索。

Method: 构建包含15个数据集和13个子任务的TeleEval-OS基准，分四个层次评估模型能力，采用零样本和少样本方法测试14种大语言模型。

Result: 实验表明开源大语言模型在特定场景下表现优于闭源模型。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS为电信运营调度领域提供了首个评估基准，展示了开源模型的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

### [2] [Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11063)
*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了多模态检索增强生成（RAG）系统中证据位置对性能的影响，发现位置偏差显著且随模态多样性增加而加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统对证据顺序敏感，导致性能不稳定和推理偏差，需研究位置偏差的影响。

Method: 通过文本、图像及混合模态任务的实验，引入位置敏感指数（PSI_p）和可视化框架分析注意力分配。

Result: 发现多模态交互加剧位置偏差，偏差随检索范围对数增长。

Conclusion: 需证据重排或去偏策略以构建更可靠、公平的生成系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

### [3] [Smotrom tvoja pa ander drogoj verden! Resurrecting Dead Pidgin with Generative Models: Russenorsk Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11065)
*Alexey Tikhonov,Sergei Shteiner,Anna Bykova,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用现代大语言模型（LLMs）分析历史贸易语言Russenorsk的词汇，构建结构化词典，并验证其与学术文献假设的一致性，同时开发翻译代理重构现代文本的Russenorsk版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Russenorsk作为一种独特的贸易混合语言，其词汇和语法结构的研究有助于理解语言接触现象。

Method: 基于现存文献构建词典，利用LLMs分析词汇来源和构词原则，开发翻译代理重构文本。

Result: 验证了LLMs生成的假设与学术文献的一致性，并成功重构了现代文本的Russenorsk版本。

Conclusion: LLMs为历史语言研究提供了新工具，Russenorsk的构词和语法原则得到进一步验证。

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化流程，用于从临床笔记中提取系统回顾（ROS）实体，结合开源LLM和ChatGPT，实现了低成本、高效的本地部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床笔记中ROS实体提取的高成本和可扩展性问题，为资源有限的医疗环境提供可行方案。

Method: 使用SecTag提取ROS部分，结合少量样本的LLM识别ROS实体范围、状态及关联系统，测试了开源LLM（Mistral、Llama、Gemma）和ChatGPT。

Result: ChatGPT表现最佳（实体范围错误率28.2%，状态/系统错误率14.5%），开源LLM表现接近（实体范围错误率30.5-36.7%，状态/系统错误率24.3-27.3%）。

Conclusion: 该流程可扩展且支持本地部署，开源LLM是商业模型的有效替代方案，适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在道德推理中存在义务判断偏差（DKB），即容易被模态表达（如“必须”或“应该”）影响，将非义务场景误判为义务。通过结合少量示例和推理提示，可以缓解这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在义务判断中的偏差现象，揭示模态表达对其决策的影响，以提升模型的道德推理能力。

Method: 通过实验分析LLMs在不同模态表达下的义务判断倾向，并提出结合少量示例和推理提示的缓解策略。

Result: LLMs在模态表达存在时，将90%以上的常识场景误判为义务，且这一现象在不同模型和问题类型中一致。

Conclusion: 模态表达会显著影响LLMs的义务判断，需通过技术手段（如提示策略）缓解偏差，以确保模型决策的合理性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种接口架构，旨在通过自然语言指令实现原型模型的精准控制，弥补设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设计师希望通过自然语言指令直观地控制原型模型，但现有大型语言模型在此领域的潜力尚未完全发挥，主要因语言抽象层次、语义精度和词汇范围的不匹配。

Method: 基于快速原型设计实践的系统调查，设计了接口的操作机制，并开发了自动化领域规范算法。

Result: 机器评估和跨产品设计领域的人体研究表明，该接口可作为大型语言模型的辅助模块，实现精准有效的原型模型控制。

Conclusion: 提出的接口架构能够有效弥补设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距，提升原型模型控制的直观性和精确性。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLAIM的新方法，通过调整跨语言注意力模式，减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的多语言对象幻觉问题，无需大量训练资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练或微调，资源消耗大，而多语言查询时模型更容易产生与视觉输入不一致的响应。

Method: CLAIM通过识别语言特定的跨模态注意力头，估计从英语到目标语言的注意力偏移向量，并在推理时干预注意力输出。

Result: 实验表明，CLAIM在多语言基准测试中平均提升了13.56%（西班牙语最高30%），并在MME基准的幻觉子集上提升了21.75%。

Conclusion: 多语言注意力差异在中间层最显著，凸显了这些层在多语言场景中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

### [8] [CyclicReflex: Improving Large Reasoning Models via Cyclical Reflection Token Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11077)
*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整反思令牌（reflection tokens）使用的方法CyclicReflex，通过周期性调度提升大型推理模型（LRMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反思令牌的过度或不足使用会影响模型性能，需要一种自适应方法来优化其分配。

Method: 提出CyclicReflex策略，通过三角波形动态调整反思令牌的logits。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了CyclicReflex的有效性，性能优于标准解码和其他方法。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex是一种有效的解码策略，能显著提升LRMs的推理性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND是一个结合大型语言模型与经验学习的框架，通过逻辑推理任务改进假新闻检测，解决了现有方法的噪声证据选择、泛化瓶颈和决策不透明等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线虚假内容泛滥，现有假新闻检测方法存在噪声证据选择、泛化能力不足和决策过程不透明等问题，亟需改进。

Method: RoE-FND分为两阶段：自反性知识构建（分析历史推理错误）和动态准则检索（从历史案例中提取推理指南），并通过双通道程序交叉验证。

Result: RoE-FND在三个数据集上表现出优于现有方法的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RoE-FND通过经验学习和逻辑推理，显著提升了假新闻检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

*Han Zhou,Qitong Xu,Yiheng Dong,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MANBench是一个双语（英语和中文）基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多种任务中的表现，发现MLLMs在某些任务中表现优异，但在复杂推理任务中仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的快速发展，需要评估其在多模态任务中是否超越人类能力。

Method: 开发了包含1,314个问题的MANBench基准测试，涵盖九类任务，并通过人类实验与MLLMs进行对比。

Result: MLLMs在知识类和文本-图像理解任务中表现优异，但在跨模态推理和复杂任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs的局限性，并呼吁进一步缩小其与人类能力的差距。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/micdz/MANBench.

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于开源大语言模型（LLM）的方法SAGE，用于从自然语言规范中生成上下文无关计数器文法（CCFG），并通过强化学习优化文法质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范生成有效且通用的文法是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。

Method: 方法包括微调开源LLM进行规范到文法的转换，并应用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）增强文法的有效性和通用性。同时研究了迭代反馈对修正文法错误的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE在文法质量和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLM，文法有效性提升15.92%，测试效果提升12.34%。

Conclusion: SAGE方法在生成有效且通用的文法方面表现出色，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于建模临床决策过程的序列进展，通过学习预测患者诊断旅程中的下一步，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖孤立的诊断分类，无法捕捉临床决策的序列依赖性，PRISM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM将临床轨迹标记化为事件序列，利用自定义临床词汇和自回归训练目标，学习预测下一步。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在预测任务中显著优于随机基线，生成的序列反映真实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为序列化医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成语言模型技术在结构化医疗数据中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate是一种多智能体辩论框架，通过LLM之间的对抗性论证主动识别和减少不安全行为，结合长期记忆模块提升AI安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险。RedDebate通过多智能体辩论和红队测试自动化提升安全性。

Method: 利用多LLM相互批判性审查，结合长期记忆模块保留安全见解，通过红队测试系统性发现盲点。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，辩论单独减少17.7%不安全行为，结合记忆模块减少23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个完全自动化结合多智能体辩论与红队测试的框架，无需人工干预即可提升AI安全性。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

Result: 实验表明当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；随着采用者增加，整体收益下降。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有零和性质，传统SEO策略在LLM环境中更有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

*Pengbo Wang,Chaozhuo Li,Chenxu Wang,Liwen Zheng,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SPACE框架，通过编辑共享激活子空间联合提升LLMs的事实性和忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但实际部署中因事实性和忠实性幻觉问题受限。现有方法独立解决这些问题，但会导致性能权衡。

Method: 通过分析LLMs激活空间动态，发现两类幻觉共享子空间，提出SPACE框架，结合谱聚类和注意力头显著性评分编辑共享子空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明SPACE方法的优越性。

Conclusion: SPACE为联合解决LLMs的事实性和忠实性幻觉提供了有效框架。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

*Ningyuan Li,Junrui Liu,Yi Shan,Minghui Huang,Tong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PankRAG框架通过全局感知的分层查询解析和依赖感知的重新排序机制，解决了传统基于图的RAG方法在实体提取中的局限性，显著提升了检索和生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法仅依赖实体提取，容易忽略潜在关键信息，导致检索内容不相关或矛盾，增加幻觉风险。

Method: PankRAG采用分层查询解析路径和依赖感知的重新排序机制，结合结构化推理和多级依赖关系，优化检索结果。

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过改进查询解析和检索机制，有效提升了RAG方法的性能，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的无监督领域适应方法，利用未标记数据和LLM反馈提升ASR系统在命名实体识别上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在通用转录任务上表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配时仍有困难。LLM在跨领域任务中表现更优。

Method: 使用LLM作为奖励模型，为ASR模型的假设打分，通过强化学习微调ASR模型。

Result: 在实体词错误率上比传统自训练方法提高了21%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了ASR系统在领域适应和命名实体识别上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT)框架，扩展了RAG以支持多轮对话和动态工具环境，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统局限于静态、单轮交互，不适合动态领域（如医疗和智能家居），需要适应不断变化的用户意图和工具环境。

Method: DCT结合了基于注意力的上下文缓存、LoRA检索和高效上下文压缩，以动态选择工具并跟踪历史信息。

Result: 实验显示DCT提高了14%的计划准确率，减少37%的幻觉，性能接近GPT-4但成本更低。

Conclusion: DCT能泛化到未见过的工具，适用于广泛的动态环境，具有可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

TL;DR: ScIRGen是一个科学QA与检索数据集生成框架，旨在更准确地反映专业研究者的信息需求，并创建了一个大规模的科学检索增强生成数据集ScIRGen-Geo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索和QA数据集通常处理简单问题，与真实研究需求不符，因此需要开发更贴合实际信息需求的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集导向信息提取方法，采用认知分类法生成高质量问题，并利用LLMs的困惑度变化自动筛选合成答案。

Result: 创建了包含61k QA对的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并发现现有方法在处理复杂问题时仍存在推理困难。

Conclusion: ScIRGen推动了更复杂工具的开发，以支持科学社区的信息需求。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与度至关重要，但在NLP领域研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模和持久同调技术，分析文本语义网络的拓扑特征（如连通分量、循环、空洞），作为信息差的代理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了好奇心预测的准确性（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与度的关系提供了新的计算方法。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

Result: 开发了开源基准和评估框架，以促进LLM代理的实用化发展。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench为评估DRA提供了标准化工具，有助于加速LLM代理的研究与应用。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

Motivation: 现有ICL方法（如少样本微调）性能仍落后于专用微调，且存在效率低和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出ManyICL方法，将多样本上下文中的每个答案作为监督目标，优化训练目标。

Result: ManyICL在多任务中显著优于零/少样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: ManyICL是一种高效的多任务学习方法，性能接近专用微调，且代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Method: 提出动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图级别分配自适应掩码，无需微调或预定义结构，保持计算效率。

Result: 该方法与全注意力模型高度对齐，减少内存和计算开销，同时保持检索性能。

Conclusion: DAM为大规模语言模型提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，兼顾效率和性能。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs在资源受限环境中的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

### [30] [AssertBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Self-Assertion in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11110)
*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench是一个基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在面对用户对事实的相反断言时，是否能保持一致的真相评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在用户对事实的相反断言下是否能够坚持其真相评估，而非随用户断言改变。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集中采样证据支持的事实，构建两种相反的提示（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型的同意和推理。

Result: 通过分层结果，AssertBench旨在衡量LLM在面对矛盾用户断言时坚持真相的能力。

Conclusion: AssertBench为评估LLM的真相一致性提供了新方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

Motivation: 现有基准测试多为文本、英语为主，且集中于医学领域，无法全面评估医疗知识和多模态推理能力。

Method: 构建KokushiMD-10基准，包含11588道真实考试题目，涵盖医学、牙科、护理等多个领域，并整合临床图像和专家注释。

Result: 测试了30多种先进LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5等），结果显示无模型能稳定通过所有领域。

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为评估和推进多语言、多模态医疗AI提供了全面资源，凸显了医疗AI的持续挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

TL;DR: MATTER是一种新型的标记化方法，通过整合材料知识，解决了传统标记化方法在材料科学中的语义和结构完整性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标记化方法在材料科学中常导致过度碎片化和语义丢失，无法保持材料概念的结构和语义完整性。

Method: MATTER结合了基于材料知识库训练的MatDetector和一种重新排序方法，优先合并材料概念，避免碎片化。

Result: 实验表明，MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别平均提升了4%和2%的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了领域知识在科学文本处理标记化策略中的重要性。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct是一个高质量指令数据集，通过两阶段流程增强LLM的基础和聊天能力，显著提升开源模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集局限于狭窄领域，限制了LLM的泛化能力，与专有模型差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段从1亿样本中筛选出740万高质量基础指令；第二阶段通过选择、进化和过滤合成150万高质量聊天指令。

Result: 微调后模型在基础和指令跟随任务中表现显著提升，InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令任务上超越GPT-4-0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct展示了基础和聊天训练的协同效应，为LLM开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

TL;DR: 该研究利用基础模型分析自发语音，以非侵入性方式检测阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆（ADRD），发现基于语音的模型（如Whisper-medium）和语言模型（如BERT）在分类认知状态方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测ADRD对及时干预至关重要，自发语音中的声学和语言标记可作为非侵入性生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，包含1600多名参与者的录音，筛选后分为健康对照组（HC）、轻度认知障碍（MCI）和阿尔茨海默病（AD）。测试多种开源基础模型分类认知状态。

Result: Whisper-medium模型在语音模型中表现最佳（准确率0.731，AUC 0.802），BERT在语言模型中表现最佳（准确率0.662，AUC 0.744）。ASR生成的音频嵌入效果优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于声学的方法（尤其是ASR嵌入）在ADRD早期检测中具有可扩展、非侵入性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

### [37] [SDMPrune: Self-Distillation MLP Pruning for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11120)
*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失的方法，以更准确地利用原始模型的预测信息，显著压缩LLM而不明显降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能强大，但其部署成本高昂，梯度剪枝方法虽有效，但忽略了生成能力的关键信息。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，专注于MLP模块剪枝，因其对预测敏感度较低且参数占比高。

Result: 在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，性能在1B规模开源LLMs中极具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了剪枝过程中的信息缺失问题，显著提升了压缩效果和性能保持。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

Motivation: 现实领域不匹配导致ASR性能下降，TTA与语言模型结合时存在干扰问题，需有效整合方法。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，基于熵最小化的TTA方法，结合语言模型重评分，采用自动步长选择机制控制适应过程。

Result: 在18个多样化ASR数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM有效解决了TTA与语言模型结合的干扰问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术，具有高度可扩展性和欺骗性，亟需有效防御手段。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架注入对抗性扰动，并设计EchoGuard利用自然失真（如回声）干扰ASR。

Result: 39人用户研究表明，EchoGuard在破坏ASR的同时提供了最佳的人类通话体验。

Conclusion: EchoGuard是一种实用且高效的防御方案，能有效对抗语音钓鱼攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Conclusion: 语音作为GUI代理的指令模态具有巨大潜力和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否随着能力的提升而趋向人类推理模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具包，评估38个语言模型在383个推理任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，错误答案中符合人类推理谬误的比例增加（ρ=0.360，p=0.0265），且与错误率无关。

Conclusion: 语言模型的发展趋向人类认知模式，包括其偏见和局限性，挑战了模型会自然趋向完全理性的观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Conclusion: CHECK为医疗等高风险领域提供了一种可扩展的安全LLM部署方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Motivation: 解决低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升问题，避免依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 利用现有ASR模型生成伪标签，训练高保真TTS系统，合成语音-文本对并反馈至ASR系统。

Result: 在台湾普通话任务中，Twister模型比Whisper错误率降低20%（普通话）和50%（中英混合）。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

TL;DR: 研究评估了开源和专有大型语言模型（LLMs）在电子健康记录（EHR）中提取药物信息并分类其状态的能力，发现LLMs表现优异，尤其是GPT-4o和开源模型Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的药物停用信息对患者安全至关重要，但常因信息埋藏在非结构化文本中而难以提取。

Method: 研究收集了三个EHR数据集，评估了12种LLMs，并探索了多种提示策略，比较了药物提取、状态分类及联合任务的性能。

Result: GPT-4o在零样本设置下表现最佳（提取F1 94.0%，分类78.1%，联合任务72.7%），开源模型紧随其后。医学专用LLMs表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在EHR药物信息提取和停用分类中潜力巨大，开源模型可替代专有系统，少量样本学习能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在证明在计算资源受限的全球南方地区，小模型仍能有效参与高性能任务。

Method: 使用参数少于1B的小模型参与BEA 2025共享任务。

Result: 模型在五个赛道中与优胜者的性能差距为6.46至13.13分，表明小模型仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 小模型（<1B参数）在低预算GPU或无GPU环境下仍能有效完成任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Motivation: 现有去偏方法仅针对单语言，无法利用多语言表示中共享语义空间的优势。

Method: 提出IMSAE方法，通过迭代SVD截断识别和缓解多语言的联合偏置子空间。

Result: 在八种语言和五个维度上验证，IMSAE优于传统单语言和跨语言方法，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: IMSAE在多语言去偏任务中表现出色，尤其在零样本设置下具有潜力。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Result: SEAR在所有表格类型中表现优于基线方法，且表格结构重构能进一步提升推理能力。

Conclusion: SEAR框架通过自适应提示和结构化推理显著提升了时间表格推理的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过学习专用的“继续思考”标记（<|continue-thinking|>），可以在推理时扩展模型的思考步骤，显著提升数学基准测试的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过学习专用的标记来触发扩展推理，以提升语言模型的性能。

Method: 在蒸馏版DeepSeek-R1模型中添加一个学习的“继续思考”标记，仅通过强化学习训练其嵌入，同时冻结模型权重。

Result: 学习的标记在标准数学基准测试中比基线模型和固定标记方法（如“Wait”）表现更好，例如在GSM8K上提升4.2%。

Conclusion: 学习专用的“继续思考”标记是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习在机器学习中表现出提升训练效率和泛化能力的潜力，但在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未充分探索，因此本文进行了系统研究。

Method: 实验了多种课程学习设置（如基础课程学习、基于步调的采样和交错课程），并基于六种难度指标（语言学和信息论角度）进行指导。

Result: 课程学习在训练早期和中期显著提升收敛速度，作为预热策略时性能提升可达3.5%。压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性被证明是有效的难度信号。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据排序在大规模预训练中的重要性，并为实际训练场景下的高效模型开发提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

*Mohammad Hammoud,Devang Acharya*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Avey的新神经网络架构，旨在解决Transformer在处理长序列和注意力机制复杂度高的问题，同时避免了RNN的并行性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer虽然在大语言模型和下游任务中表现优异，但其固定上下文窗口和注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了其处理长序列的能力。RNN虽然能线性扩展序列长度，但并行性较差。因此，需要一种新的架构来兼顾长序列处理和高效并行性。

Method: Avey由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，通过协作识别和上下文化最相关的令牌，解耦序列长度和上下文宽度，从而支持任意长度序列的处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，Avey在短程NLP任务上与Transformer表现相当，同时在捕捉长程依赖关系方面表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey作为一种新型架构，有效解决了Transformer和RNN的局限性，为长序列处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理（包括大脑成像数据）的预测能力之间的关系。

Method: 使用17个预训练的Transformer模型，评估其在三种不同语言家族和两个fMRI数据集上的预测能力。

Result: 模型困惑度与模型拟合度之间仍存在正相关关系，表明这一趋势不仅限于基于延迟的测量。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理的预测能力具有普遍性，适用于多种测量方式。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Method: 引入LLM代理进行论文成对比较，而非单独评分，通过大量成对评估结果聚合，更准确地衡量论文相对质量。

Result: 实验表明，成对比较方法在识别高影响力论文上显著优于传统评分方法，但也发现了新颖性降低和机构不平衡等偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs在重新构想同行评审方面具有变革潜力，但需解决公平性和多样性等关键挑战。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Result: 实验表明，基于文本的SD方法（尤其是MPM）在短对话中表现优于传统音频SD系统。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了利用语言特征进行SD的潜力，并强调了语义理解在SD系统中的重要性，为未来多模态和语义特征研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across

Motivation: 受人类认知发展的启发，旨在通过同步模型增长和数据难度提升，提高预训练效率。

Method: 提出Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling（CGLS），逐步堆叠层并同步增加数据难度，从简单数据（如短篇故事）过渡到复杂数据（如技术内容）。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优于基线方法，泛化和零样本性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CGLS通过渐进式堆叠层和数据难度，为知识密集型和推理任务提供了一种简单有效的预训练策略。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLMs的KV缓存需求大，现有方法效率低或信息丢失严重。

Method: 将序列分块并使用交替分区策略进行聚类，合并KV缓存为单一质心。

Result: 实验显示内存使用减少80%，解码速度提升3.19倍，延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea高效且实用，适用于长上下文LLMs部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and

*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR通过引入代理指导机制，改进了传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中的表现，显著提升了模型在软件工程任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中效果不佳，因为奖励稀疏且问题解决步骤复杂，导致模型训练困难。

Method: Agent-RLVR结合代理指导机制，利用多样信息线索（如战略计划和动态反馈）引导代理，并通过RLVR更新策略。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified上，Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1性能从9.4%提升至22.4%，进一步优化后达到27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR为复杂现实环境中使用RLVR训练代理奠定了基础，解决了传统RL方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

*Taeeun Kim,Semin Jeong,Youngsook Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KoGEC是一个基于预训练翻译模型的韩语语法纠错系统，通过微调NLLB模型，在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效的韩语语法纠错系统，并探索任务专用模型在专业NLP任务中的潜力。

Method: 微调NLLB模型，使用特殊语言标记区分原始和纠正句子，并通过BLEU和LLM评估方法测试性能。

Result: KoGEC在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3，尤其在标点错误纠正上更平衡。

Conclusion: KoGEC为NLP领域提供了高效的韩语GEC系统，展示了任务专用模型在专业任务中的竞争力。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

*Harvey Yiyun Fu,Aryan Shrivastava,Jared Moore,Peter West,Chenhao Tan,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AbsenceBench，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）检测缺失信息的能力，发现即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在此任务上表现不佳，F1分数仅为69.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在处理长输入和定位特定信息方面表现出色（如NIAH测试），但在检测明显缺失信息时仍存在困难。

Method: 通过AbsenceBench评估LLMs在数值序列、诗歌和GitHub拉取请求三个领域中检测缺失信息的能力，模型需在原始和编辑后的上下文中识别被删除的部分。

Result: 实验表明，即使先进模型在平均5K tokens的上下文长度下，F1分数仅为69.6%，表现不佳。

Conclusion: Transformer注意力机制难以处理文档中的“空白”，因为这些缺失不对应任何可关注的特定键值。研究揭示了模型在NIAH任务和AbsenceBench任务中的表现差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的机器翻译系统缺乏有效的自动评估指标和足够的人类评估者，需要解决这一资源缺口。

Method: 通过全面回顾现有评估流程，设计了一个招募和游戏化评估平台。

Result: 提出了一个针对机器翻译系统开发者的评估平台设计方案，并讨论了其挑战和潜在应用。

Conclusion: 该平台有望填补低资源语言机器翻译评估的资源缺口，并在更广泛的自然语言处理研究中发挥作用。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

TL;DR: Med-PRM是一个基于检索增强生成的过程奖励建模框架，用于在临床决策中验证和纠正推理步骤，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在临床推理中难以定位和纠正具体步骤的错误，而医学领域需要精确的错误识别和修正以确保诊断准确性。

Method: 利用检索增强生成技术，通过医学知识库验证每个推理步骤，精细评估推理质量。

Result: 在五个医学QA基准和两个开放式诊断任务中，Med-PRM表现最优，将基础模型性能提升高达13.50%，并在小规模模型上首次实现MedQA超过80%的准确率。

Conclusion: Med-PRM通过验证推理步骤显著提升临床决策的准确性和可靠性，且具有通用性，可与其他模型无缝集成。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural

grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了BERT是否真正理解抽象关系，发现预训练BERT虽能高精度分类关系，但关系表征结构需通过微调任务才能显现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究BERT是否具备真正的概念能力，而非仅依赖表面统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT对概念对的内部表征（分类、部分与功能关系），比较其在[CLS]标记嵌入中的表征结构。

Result: 预训练BERT能高精度分类关系，但关系类型的高维嵌入结构需通过微调任务诱导。

Conclusion: 行为表现不必然反映结构化概念理解，但模型可通过适当训练获得关系抽象的归纳偏置。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Lag-Relative Sparse Attention（LRSA）的方法，通过LagKV压缩技术减少长上下文处理的成本和内存占用，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时存在计算和内存问题，现有压缩方法在推理时会导致性能下降。

Method: 采用分块预填充和固定滞后窗口选择最相关的键值对，以减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答任务中取得更好的微调效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法在无需额外参数和低计算开销的情况下，有效解决了长上下文处理的性能问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Method: 提出了两种集成方法：两步法和端到端法，并比较其优缺点；同时引入参数共享策略以减少参数数量并提升性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，端到端法在性能上与两步法相当，且参数共享策略能减少参数并提升性能。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在多模态对话响应检索中具有潜力，参数共享策略进一步优化了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了个性化对话的质量。

Conclusion: MUDI方法通过结构化学习和注意力策略，有效生成更自然的个性化对话。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在多语言文本标注任务中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入多语言数据集MultiDiac，评估14种LLMs和6种专业标注模型，并对4种小模型进行LoRA微调。

Result: 现成的LLMs在阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语标注任务中表现优于专业模型，但小模型易产生幻觉；微调可改善性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在多语言标注任务中具有潜力，微调小模型可减少幻觉并提升效果。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索场景上下文如何影响人类对同一抽象形状的不同概念化和命名方式，以及多模态LLM是否能捕捉这种多样性。

Method: 收集人类在不同场景中对抽象形状的命名数据（SceneGram数据集），并分析多模态LLM的表现。

Result: 多模态LLM未能充分反映人类概念化的丰富性和多样性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文显著影响人类概念化，而多模态LLM在此方面存在不足。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen在提升模型专业化与效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with

Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了CRF填充系统的开发。

Method: 提出半自动转换方法，将信息提取任务数据集转换为结构化CRF，应用于E3C数据集。

Result: 生成的CRF填充数据集上，零-shot大型语言模型在意大利语和英语上的填充准确率分别为59.7%和67.3%，开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 填充CRF对现有模型具有挑战性，公开的数据集有助于推动相关研究。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除特定信息以评估其对模型行为的影响。

Method: 提出MP和LEACE两种方法，与INLP对比，测试其在Amnesic probing中的效果。

Result: MP和LEACE能更精准地移除目标信息，减少对模型其他信息的干扰。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE优于INLP，为Amnesic probing提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

### [77] [The Cambrian Explosion of Mixed-Precision Matrix Multiplication for Quantized Deep Learning Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11728)
*Héctor Martínez,Adrián Castelló,Francisco D. Igual,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习（DL）中从传统64位浮点计算转向低精度格式（如FP16、BF16、8/16位整数）的趋势，并提出适应混合精度整数（MIP）算术的高性能矩阵乘法（gemm）优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DL对计算资源的需求增加，低精度计算和混合精度算术成为提升计算吞吐量、降低内存和带宽使用、提高能效的关键。硬件架构的演进（如支持混合精度向量单元的ISA）也推动了这一趋势。

Method: 论文重新审视传统高性能gemm，提出适应现代ISA（x86_64、ARM、RISC-V）的MIP算术策略，包括新颖的微内核设计和数据布局优化。

Result: 实验证明，MIP算术在三种代表性CPU架构上比浮点实现显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 论文标志着矩阵乘法优化的新时代，即由DL推理需求驱动的“寒武纪时期”，为异构架构上的gemm优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART提出了一种自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought（ST）替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought（CoT），以提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理计算开销大，限制了在延迟敏感应用中的部署。

Method: DART通过两个训练路径（CoT路径和ST路径）及Reasoning Evolvement Module（REM）实现推理效率提升。

Result: 实验表明DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: DART是一种高效推理的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视角，关注模型输出分布的长短对齐问题，并提出了一种正则化方法以提升长度泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文建模中受限于固定上下文窗口，长度泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过合成任务案例研究，提出长短对齐概念，并设计Long-Short Misalignment指标，开发正则化方法。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，揭示了长短对齐与长度泛化性能的强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的长上下文建模提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了零样本身份提示是否能准确预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为和政策立场，发现其预测效果较好（F1分数约0.793）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常表现出左倾偏见，但身份提示可以调整其行为以匹配不同社会经济群体。本研究旨在验证零样本身份提示是否能准确预测个体投票行为和政策立场。

Method: 使用零样本身份提示，结合有限信息，预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为和政策立场，并评估其对反事实论证、不同提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，该方法能较好地模拟欧洲议会议员的投票行为，加权F1分数约为0.793。

Conclusion: 零样本身份提示可以有效地预测欧洲议会议员的投票行为和政策立场，为政治模拟提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管任务对人类来说简单，但对多模态大语言模型的语用能力（如颜色描述的上下文依赖解释）提出了重要挑战。

Method: 通过抽象视觉刺激（如色块和色格）设计指代消解任务，测试模型的语用能力。

Result: 结果表明，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在基本语用能力上仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多模态大语言模型在语用能力方面的局限性，尤其是上下文依赖的颜色描述理解。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,

TL;DR: PPA是一种两阶段框架，先基于对话上下文生成通用回复，再通过回复检索相关人物记忆并调整回复以符合人物特征，显著提升了长期对话的一致性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中LLM在保持人物一致性和生成多样化个性化回复方面的挑战。

Method: 提出Post Persona Alignment (PPA)，分为两阶段：首先生成通用回复，再检索人物记忆并调整回复。

Result: PPA在一致性、多样性和人物相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时，KV缓存的内存需求急剧增加，现有压缩方法通常牺牲准确性或引入计算开销。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，将长上下文不敏感的维度投影到正交傅里叶基上，并用固定长度的频谱系数近似其时间演化。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上评估，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH任务上实现了最佳的长上下文准确性，并通过FlashFourierAttention优化内存。

Conclusion: FourierAttention是一种无需训练的框架，能够高效减少内存需求，同时保持长上下文任务的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Conclusion: GeistBERT为德语NLP研究提供了强大工具，并开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在大语言模型（LLM）接收到近乎完美的外部反馈时，它们仍难以完全整合反馈并纠正错误答案，这种现象被称为“反馈摩擦”。通过实验设计，作者验证了这一现象，并提出了一些缓解策略，但效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在接收外部反馈时的整合能力，明确其局限性，并为未来研究提供方向。

Method: 设计实验环境，包括问题求解模型和基于真实答案的反馈生成器，评估模型在数学推理、知识推理等多任务中的表现。

Result: 即使条件理想，LLM仍表现出对反馈的抵抗（反馈摩擦），尝试的策略虽有改进但未达目标性能。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLM的一个显著限制，排除了一些潜在原因，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Method: 将模型防御问题转化为对比表示学习问题，结合三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型上优于现有基于表示工程的防御方法，提升了对抗输入级和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性，同时不影响标准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为LLMs的对抗防御提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LLMs对现实世界的编程风格产生了可测量的影响，但难以精确估计LLM生成代码的比例。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

Result: 系统总结了KGR的研究现状，结合LLMs等先进技术，提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为KGR领域提供了全面的视角，强调了关键研究趋势，并指出了未来可能的挑战与机遇。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the

Motivation: 管理ACs的挑战在于维护嵌入知识需要大量努力，可能导致开发者放弃或管理不善，OntoGSN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: OntoGSN包括GSN标准的OWL本体、辅助本体和解析器、SPARQL查询库、原型界面等，严格遵循标准并经过多种评估。

Result: OntoGSN能够动态管理ACs，并通过一个关于大型语言模型对抗鲁棒性的案例展示了其实用性。

Conclusion: OntoGSN为ACs的动态管理提供了有效工具，支持自动化和标准化，未来开发将基于社区需求持续优化。

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated

difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

TL;DR: MUDAS是一种用于资源受限物联网设备的多标签声音分类的无监督域适应框架，通过选择性重训练和自适应阈值提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有UDA算法在资源受限设备和多标签场景中的局限性，特别是在城市声音分类等复杂环境中。

Method: MUDAS通过选择性重训练分类器、自适应阈值生成伪标签和多样性正则化来优化多标签分类。

Result: 在SONYC-UST数据集上，MUDAS显著优于现有UDA算法，适合资源受限的物联网设备。

Conclusion: MUDAS为资源受限环境中的多标签声音分类提供了一种高效的无监督域适应解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了化学表格的多模态和领域特定复杂性，限制了模型在化学科学理解中的应用。

Method: 通过从文献中提取真实化学表格，并标注单元格、逻辑布局和领域标签，支持表格识别和理解任务。

Result: 模型在基本布局解析上表现尚可，但在描述性和推理性问答任务上明显落后于人类表现，开源与闭源模型间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: ChemTable为化学表格理解提供了严格的基准，凸显了化学领域科学推理的挑战。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FocalAD是一种新型端到端自动驾驶框架，通过关注关键局部邻居和增强局部运动表示来优化规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局聚合的运动特征，忽略了规划决策主要受少数局部交互代理影响的事实，导致潜在风险被忽视。

Method: FocalAD包含两个核心模块：Ego-Local-Agents Interactor（ELAI）和Focal-Local-Agents Loss（FLA Loss），分别用于捕捉局部邻居的运动动态和增加关键邻居的权重。

Result: 在nuScenes和Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，尤其在Adv-nuScenes数据集上，碰撞率显著降低。

Conclusion: FocalAD通过聚焦局部交互显著提升了自动驾驶规划的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混合交通环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要适应人类驾驶车辆和其他异常情况，但现有方法难以解决智能体间的局部冲突和随机事件。

Method: 引入局部状态注意力模块，利用自注意力机制压缩附近智能体的关键信息，以解决交通冲突。

Result: 在模拟高速公路合并场景中，该方法显著提高了合并效率，尤其是在高密度交通环境下。

Conclusion: 局部状态注意力模块在多智能体强化学习中有效解决了冲突和泛化问题，提升了自动驾驶车辆的适应性。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法依赖局部启发式或权重标准，无法捕捉全局结构依赖，导致剪枝决策次优和模型性能下降。

Method: 利用GCN建模网络拓扑，学习通道的全局重要性，实现拓扑感知剪枝，并通过搜索方法动态调整剪枝率组合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，SACP在压缩效率和精度保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SACP框架通过全局结构建模和自动化剪枝，显著提升了剪枝效果和模型部署效率。

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需大规模训练的神经符号协调方法，提升自动定理证明的效率和可解释性。

Method: 改进DSP框架，分阶段优化：生成自然语言子目标、自动形式化子目标、结合符号搜索与步骤证明器。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，解决IMO问题并发现形式化错误。

Conclusion: DSP+展示了传统推理模式的潜力，所有组件将开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

Motivation: 现有RAG范式忽视了知识应用这一认知步骤，导致检索到的知识与任务推理之间存在脱节。

Method: RAG+构建了一个包含知识和应用示例的双重语料库，并在推理过程中联合检索两者，以支持目标导向的推理。

Result: 在数学、法律和医学领域的实验中，RAG+平均提升3-5%，复杂场景下最高提升7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+通过结合检索与可操作的应用，为知识集成提供了更认知基础的框架，推动了LLMs的进一步发展。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

Result: 方法在保持高性能的同时显著减少对付费推理的依赖。

Conclusion: 计划是协调成本感知、跨模型推理的有效先验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

Method: 数据集包含2,000多个开放性问题，基于486张图像，覆盖数学、历史等九大领域，评估13种先进VLM的多维度表现。

Result: 最强模型总体准确率低于45%，在音乐、数学和对抗性问题中表现尤其差，显示流行基准与真实多模态理解的差距。

Conclusion: 中学任务为测试VLM提供了有效途径，尤其在非英语语境中，数据集可作为未来AI系统视觉与语言推理能力的严格测试平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优异，有效减少MLLMs的幻觉。

Conclusion: SymMPO通过对称偏好优化和直接监督，显著提升了MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

Result: 发现R-GNNs无法学习C2特征定义的价值函数，但其他GNN架构可能更适合。

Conclusion: R-GNNs在特定规划任务中存在局限性，需探索其他GNN架构。

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for

influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险场景中的应用增加，其伦理问题（如人口统计偏差、问责制和隐私）日益凸显。

Method: 通过AI自动化招聘的案例研究，分析了数据偏差对两种不同LLM构建的系统的影响，并提出了一种隐私增强框架以减少性别信息。

Result: 实验表明，提出的框架能有效防止训练系统复制数据中的偏差。

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架是减轻LLMs中人口统计偏差的有效方法。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡预测正确性、知识成本和决策置信度，优化人机协作决策的效率和质量。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1) 延迟策略根据置信度决定是否接受基础模型答案或重新生成；2) 弃权策略决定是否需要人类干预。结合在线学习机制利用人类反馈提升决策质量。

Result: 在通用问答（ARC-Easy、ARC-Challenge）和医学问答（MedQA、MedMCQA）任务中，级联策略在准确性和成本上优于单模型基线。

Conclusion: 级联框架提供了一种高效且成本可控的人机协作决策方法，适用于多领域问答任务。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模式链接模型的微调方法过度依赖死记硬背，缺乏推理能力，原因是高质量推理样本难以获取。

Method: Schema-R1通过构建高质量推理样本小批量、监督微调冷启动初始化以及基于规则的强化学习训练三个关键步骤实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模式链接模型的推理能力，过滤准确率提高了10%。

Conclusion: Schema-R1通过强化学习有效解决了模式链接中的推理能力不足问题，为Text-to-SQL任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过战略游戏评估大语言模型（LLMs）的中间推理步骤（如规划、修正和资源约束决策），并定义了多个新指标。实验显示，ChatGPT-o3-mini表现最佳，而Qwen-Plus因资源过度使用表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多关注最终结果，忽视了中间推理步骤，而这些步骤对理解模型行为和提升可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用战略游戏作为评估环境，提出框架评估LLMs在规划、修正和资源约束决策三个维度的表现，并定义新指标（如修正成功率、过度修正风险率等）。

Result: ChatGPT-o3-mini在4320轮对抗中表现最佳，胜率74.7%，修正成功率78.6%；Qwen-Plus因过度修正风险率81.6%胜率仅25.6%。

Conclusion: 评估LLMs的决策过程（而不仅是结果）对理解其行为和改进可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和不同LLMs上，RefRank显著优于点对点基线，性能与成对方法相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: RefRank是一种高效且有效的排序方法，平衡了计算成本和排序准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in the
task of text ranking for information retrieval. While Pointwise ranking
approaches offer computational efficiency by scoring documents independently,
they often yield biased relevance estimates due to the lack of inter-document
comparisons. In contrast, Pairwise methods improve ranking accuracy by
explicitly comparing document pairs, but suffer from substantial computational
overhead with quadratic complexity ($O(n^2)$). To address this tradeoff, we
propose \textbf{RefRank}, a simple and effective comparative ranking method
based on a fixed reference document. Instead of comparing all document pairs,
RefRank prompts the LLM to evaluate each candidate relative to a shared
reference anchor. By selecting the reference anchor that encapsulates the core
query intent, RefRank implicitly captures relevance cues, enabling indirect
comparison between documents via this common anchor. This reduces computational
cost to linear time ($O(n)$) while importantly, preserving the advantages of
comparative evaluation. To further enhance robustness, we aggregate multiple
RefRank outputs using a weighted averaging scheme across different reference
choices. Experiments on several benchmark datasets and with various LLMs show
that RefRank significantly outperforms Pointwise baselines and could achieve
performance at least on par with Pairwise approaches with a significantly lower
computational cost.

Conclusion: 提出的参考模型和模式集合为自动化生产事件数据提取提供了标准化和高效的方法。

Abstract: With the advent of digital transformation, organisations are increasingly
generating large volumes of data through the execution of various processes
across disparate systems. By integrating data from these heterogeneous sources,
it becomes possible to derive new insights essential for tasks such as
monitoring and analysing process performance. Typically, this information is
extracted during a data pre-processing or engineering phase. However, this step
is often performed in an ad-hoc manner and is time-consuming and
labour-intensive. To streamline this process, we introduce a reference model
and a collection of patterns designed to enrich production event data. The
reference model provides a standard way for storing and extracting production
event data. The patterns describe common information extraction tasks and how
such tasks can be automated effectively. The reference model is developed by
combining the ISA-95 industry standard with the Event Knowledge Graph
formalism. The patterns are developed based on empirical observations from
event data sets originating in manufacturing processes and are formalised using
the reference model. We evaluate the relevance and applicability of these
patterns by demonstrating their application to use cases.

Result: 实验表明DMICF在多样化交互分布的数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: DMICF通过语义解耦和意图对齐，显著提升了推荐系统的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Disentangling user intentions from implicit feedback has become a promising
strategy to enhance recommendation accuracy and interpretability. Prior methods
often model intentions independently and lack explicit supervision, thus
failing to capture the joint semantics that drive user-item interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose DMICF, a unified framework that
explicitly models interaction-level intent alignment while leveraging
structural signals from both user and item perspectives. DMICF adopts a
dual-view architecture that jointly encodes user-item interaction graphs from
both sides, enabling bidirectional information fusion. This design enhances
robustness under data sparsity by allowing the structural redundancy of one
view to compensate for the limitations of the other. To model fine-grained
user-item compatibility, DMICF introduces an intent interaction encoder that
performs sub-intent alignment within each view, uncovering shared semantic
structures that underlie user decisions. This localized alignment enables
adaptive refinement of intent embeddings based on interaction context, thus
improving the model's generalization and expressiveness, particularly in
long-tail scenarios. Furthermore, DMICF integrates an intent-aware scoring
mechanism that aggregates compatibility signals from matched intent pairs
across user and item subspaces, enabling personalized prediction grounded in
semantic congruence rather than entangled representations. To facilitate
semantic disentanglement, we design a discriminative training signal via
multi-negative sampling and softmax normalization, which pulls together
semantically aligned intent pairs while pushing apart irrelevant or noisy ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMICF consistently delivers robust
performance across datasets with diverse interaction distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以识别新闻中隐含的复杂因果关系，尤其是在数据稀缺的情况下。GraphRAG-Causal旨在通过结构化因果知识图谱和混合检索系统解决这一问题。

Method: 框架分为三阶段：数据准备（标注新闻句子并构建因果图）、图检索（存储图谱并混合查询）、LLM推理（利用检索结果进行少样本学习）。

Result: 实验显示，GraphRAG-Causal在仅使用20个少样本示例的情况下，因果分类F1分数达到82.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了准确性和一致性，适用于新闻可靠性评估、虚假信息检测和政策分析等实时应用。

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

Motivation: 传统信息检索方法在多跳推理或复杂语义理解任务中表现不佳，而大型语言模型成本高且难以部署。

Method: 采用半规则奖励函数和强化学习，训练小型语言模型（如Qwen2.5-7B和1.5B）进行查询推理。

Result: 在BRIGHT基准测试中，TongSearch QR显著优于现有基线，包括基于提示的查询推理器和密集检索器。

Conclusion: TongSearch QR在推理密集型检索任务中表现出色，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Traditional information retrieval (IR) methods excel at textual and semantic
matching but struggle in reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks that require
multi-hop inference or complex semantic understanding between queries and
documents. One promising solution is to explicitly rewrite or augment queries
using large language models (LLMs) to elicit reasoning-relevant content prior
to retrieval. However, the widespread use of large-scale language models like
GPT-4 or LLaMA3-70B remains impractical due to their high inference cost and
limited deployability in real-world systems. In this work, we introduce
TongSearch QR (Previously Known as "TongSearch Reasoner"), a family of
small-scale language models for query reasoning and rewriting in
reasoning-intensive retrieval. With a novel semi-rule-based reward function, we
employ reinforcement learning approaches enabling smaller language models, e,g,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, to achieve query reasoning
performance rivaling large-scale language models without their prohibitive
inference costs. Experiment results on BRIGHT benchmark show that with BM25 as
retrievers, both TongSearch QR-7B and TongSearch QR-1.5B models significantly
outperform existing baselines, including prompt-based query reasoners and some
latest dense retrievers trained for reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks,
offering superior adaptability for real-world deployment.

Method: 通过六个月内每周系统性地使用11个查询进行搜索，分析视频召回率、精确度、时间衰减和一致性。

Result: 发现搜索功能在相关性排名中存在大量无关视频，时间衰减严重（20-60天后视频可发现性大幅下降），且搜索结果缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: YouTube Data API的搜索功能不适合稳健的学术研究，建议采取缓解策略，但仍存在根本性不足。

Abstract: This paper critically audits the search endpoint of YouTube's Data API (v3),
a common tool for academic research. Through systematic weekly searches over
six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding
completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal
substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in
terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous
off-topic videos. We also find severe temporal decay, as the number of findable
videos for a specific period dramatically decreases after just 20-60 days from
the publication date, potentially hampering many different research designs.
Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding
different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the
European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research
outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes
that the API's search function, potentially prioritizing "freshness" over
comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research,
especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

*Minhyuk Seo,Taeheon Kim,Hankook Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对多模态个性化联邦学习（PFL）的新方法，解决了数据异构性和模型异构性问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练的基础模型存在隐私和高传输成本问题，而联邦学习（FL）和个性化联邦学习（PFL）提供了分布式解决方案，但现有研究多局限于模拟环境，忽略了真实场景中的异构性问题。

Method: 针对数据异构性，提出任务相似性感知的模型聚合方法；针对模型异构性，提出维度不变模块以实现跨模型知识共享。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在个性化和泛化能力上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态PFL中有效解决了异构性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 探讨算法外貌主义对合成人脸和性别分类的影响。

Method: 实验分析了13,200张合成人脸，评估T2I系统和性别分类模型的表现。

Result: T2I系统将外貌与无关特质关联，性别分类模型在“不吸引人”面孔上错误率更高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字身份系统中的公平性问题。

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital
identity systems.

Motivation: 动态电价（dToU）的推广需要准确识别受益家庭，但真实数据使用涉及隐私问题，因此需研究合成数据方法。

Method: 评估了四种合成数据生成方法（WGAN、CTGAN、扩散模型和高斯噪声增强），比较其分类效用、分布保真度和隐私泄漏。

Result: 扩散模型在分类效用上表现最佳（macro-F1达88.2%），CTGAN对重建攻击的抵抗力最强。

Conclusion: 结构化生成模型在开发隐私保护的数据驱动能源系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合小规模代码模型与GRPO的方法，用于生成低资源语言的准确可执行代码，并以Prolog为例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对训练数据有限的编程语言（如Prolog），传统大语言模型难以生成准确可执行代码，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 使用Qwen 2.5小规模代码模型结合GRPO，通过显式推理步骤生成代码，并将推理反馈融入强化学习循环。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了代码的逻辑一致性、语法准确性和推理质量。

Conclusion: 该方法对缺乏训练资源的编程语言具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Result: 移动数据和GCN模块对预测性能提升有限，但死亡和住院数据显著提高准确性。空间地图与封锁令有显著相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为传染病预测中的移动数据表示提供了新视角，有助于决策者更好地应对未来疫情。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

TL;DR: YingLong是一个非因果、双向注意力编码器Transformer，通过掩码标记恢复训练，在时间序列预测中表现出色，尤其在长输出任务中准确性显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间序列预测方法（直接或递归）存在局限性，需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 提出YingLong框架，采用非因果、双向注意力编码器Transformer，通过掩码标记恢复训练，并使用多输入集成减少输出方差。

Result: 在ETT和Weather数据集上零样本任务中表现优异，GIFT-Eval基准测试中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: YingLong在时间序列预测中具有显著优势，尤其是在长输出任务中，且模型已开源。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Forward Target Propagation (FTP)的生物可解释且计算高效的替代方法，取代了传统的反向传播算法，解决了其对称权重、非局部信用分配等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播算法在生物学和硬件视角存在局限性，如对称权重、非局部信用分配等，需要一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: FTP通过第二次前向传递估计层间目标，仅使用前馈计算，无需对称反馈权重或可学习的逆函数，实现模块化和局部学习。

Result: FTP在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100等任务上表现与反向传播相当，且在低精度量化和新兴硬件约束下优于反向传播。

Conclusion: FTP因其低计算开销、前向传递特性和硬件兼容性，为高效设备学习和神经形态计算提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行零样本检测AI生成图像的方法，提出了一种任务对齐提示方法（zero-shot-s²），显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成的图像越来越逼真，对其潜在滥用的担忧增加。传统监督检测方法依赖大型数据集且泛化能力有限，因此探索零样本检测方法。

Method: 使用预训练的VLMs，通过任务对齐提示（如“Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts”）提升模型性能，无需微调。

Result: zero-shot-s²方法在多个数据集和模型上显著提升Macro F1分数（8%-29%），并表现出强泛化能力和模型规模鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发VLMs的潜在能力，为检测AI生成图像提供了一种简单、通用且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏参数（如机器人质量分布或摩擦）的变化在执行过程中可能带来安全风险，需开发一种机制来实时适应和保障安全。

Method: 基于约束隐藏参数马尔可夫决策过程，利用函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，并通过共形预测考虑不确定性，屏蔽机制通过预测未来安全风险约束动作空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少安全违规，并在分布外泛化中表现优异，运行时开销极小。

Conclusion: 该机制满足概率安全保证，并在安全合规策略集中生成最优策略，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Result: 研究发现现有LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了现有模型的局限性，并为进一步提升LVLMs的视觉因果推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习的几何相似性模型与人类心理感知不符，而Tversky的特征集相似性理论更符合心理学，但此前未在深度学习中应用。

Method: 开发了可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并设计了Tversky投影层，用于神经网络中替代线性投影层。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层相对线性层提升了24.7%的准确率；在GPT-2中，困惑度降低7.5%，参数减少34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky相似性模型为深度学习提供了一种新的相似性范式，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Conclusion: ICL框架通过交互式学习和数据增强有效提升了TIReID的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Method: 使用图表示学习解决数据稀缺问题，并通过帕累托优化管理任务间的依赖关系。

Result: 提出的GRePO-LTV框架能够有效提升LTV预测的准确性。

Conclusion: GRePO-LTV为LTV预测提供了一种全面且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MoTE框架有效解决了类增量学习中的维度不一致和覆盖问题，并探索了适配器扩展与性能之间的权衡。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

Conclusion: ADG是一种有效的方法，解决了CFG的局限性，为高质量图像合成提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

TL;DR: ChemHGNN是一种超图神经网络框架，通过超边建模多反应物相互作用，解决了传统GNN的局限性，并在USPTO数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNN）难以有效建模多反应物相互作用，限制了反应虚拟筛选和发现的效率。

Method: 提出ChemHGNN框架，利用超边自然建模多反应物反应，并引入反应中心感知负采样策略（RCNS）和分层嵌入方法。

Result: 在USPTO数据集上，ChemHGNN显著优于HGNN和GNN基线，尤其是在大规模场景下。

Conclusion: HGNN是反应虚拟筛选和发现的更优选择，为加速反应发现提供了化学信息化的框架。

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用预训练权重指导任务特定权重的更新，避免低效训练。

Method: 通过行和列变换提取预训练权重的结构化信息，分解权重为共享和特定组件。

Result: 在CV和NLP任务中表现优异，优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: GenFT为高效模型适应提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large

Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Conclusion: STRCMP框架通过整合结构先验，显著提升了组合优化问题的求解性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: ADAMIX是一种自适应混合精度delta压缩框架，通过数学推导量化误差并优化位分配方案，显著提升了压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多租户服务等场景中，大量基于同一基础模型微调的LLM需要高效压缩，现有方法在高压缩比下性能不足或依赖经验位分配。

Method: 提出ADAMIX框架，通过数学推导量化误差，将最优混合精度位分配问题转化为0/1整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务中，ADAMIX分别以22.3%和6.1%的优势超越最佳基线Delta-CoMe。

Conclusion: ADAMIX在保持高压缩比的同时显著提升了性能，适用于大规模LLM部署场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

Motivation: 现有偏好学习框架简化人类偏好为二元比较和标量奖励，导致模型偏向某些特征，PFP旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 实验表明PFP有效减轻了在线学习中的偏见，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFP通过保留偏好特征分布，提升了模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Conclusion: SectorE通过极坐标嵌入有效解决了语义层次结构的建模问题，为知识图谱补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列数据在不同粒度下表现出状态，现有方法无法统一处理多粒度状态且适应性不足。

Method: 提出PromptTSS框架，利用提示机制结合标签和边界信息指导分割，捕捉粗粒度和细粒度模式。

Result: 实验显示PromptTSS在多粒度分割中准确率提升24.49%，单粒度分割提升17.88%，迁移学习性能提升599.24%。

Conclusion: PromptTSS能有效适应层次化状态和动态变化的时间序列数据。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对离线强化学习的数据覆盖攻击方法（CSDPC），通过毒化罕见决策模式显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视数据覆盖不足的安全风险，且单步分析不符合离线RL的多步决策特性。

Method: 引入序列级集中系数量化覆盖，提出CSDPC攻击，毒化罕见决策模式以减少覆盖。

Result: 实验显示毒化1%数据可使性能下降90%。

Conclusion: 研究为离线RL的安全分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential

Conclusion: 本文为动态决策系统中的长期公平性研究提供了新视角和方法，兼顾即时与长期公平性需求。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Motivation: 现有BEM解决方案依赖特定任务和数据的模型，限制了广泛适用性。TSFMs有望通过类似大型语言模型的泛化能力解决这一问题。

Result: TSFMs在零样本表示学习中表现良好，但在预测任务中表现不佳，尤其对协变量和复杂环境敏感。

Conclusion: TSFMs需改进协变量处理和上下文整合，以提升BEM中的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样性提升的同时，F1分数提高了1-15%。

Conclusion: MOODS框架和新的验证指标有效解决了不平衡数据分类问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple

### [168] [Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation via Evidential Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11347)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Evidential Alignment的新框架，通过不确定性量化识别和抑制虚假相关性，无需依赖外部标注或确定性模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络常依赖虚假相关性（如背景与目标的关联），导致泛化能力下降。现有方法需额外标注或确定性模型，成本高且效果有限。

Method: 利用二阶风险最小化量化模型预测的证据，并通过提出的证据校准技术校准模型，抑制虚假相关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了模型在不同架构和数据模态下的群体鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment提供了一种无需标注的、可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了虚假相关性问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: 本文不仅恢复了过参数化神经网络的核回归边界，还展示了神经网络相比核方法的特征学习能力。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN)模型，考虑了图中节点间关系对标签噪声的影响，并探索了三种EDN变体。实验表明，EDN模型对图神经网络和噪声鲁棒算法的性能影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有节点标签噪声模型（如SLN和CCN）忽略了图中节点间关系的重要性，EDN模型旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 研究了三种EDN变体，分析了节点度对标签噪声概率的影响，并在不同GNN架构和噪声鲁棒算法上进行了实验。

Result: 实验显示，两种EDN变体对GNN和噪声鲁棒算法的性能退化影响更大，统计验证了其重要性。

Conclusion: 在评估图数据的噪声鲁棒算法时，应考虑EDN模型以提高在噪声环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

Result: 随机性在精确分数函数下可作为误差修正机制，但在近似分数函数下存在误差修正与放大的权衡。

Conclusion: 随机性对生成性能的影响取决于分数误差的结构，需根据具体情况选择随机性参数。

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在多变量预测任务中难以区分不同特征的空间影响，FIGNN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FIGNN采用特征特定池化策略和掩码正则化，独立分配每个预测变量的空间重要性，并优化可解释性与预测误差的对齐。

Result: 在SPEEDY大气环流模型和BFS流体动力学基准测试中，FIGNN展示了竞争性预测性能，并揭示了各特征的物理意义空间模式。

Conclusion: FIGNN是一个适用于复杂物理领域可解释替代建模的通用框架。

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

### [173] [LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11402)
*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时，可能导致模型依赖虚假标记（如SSTI）做出决策，从而引发潜在的安全风险。研究发现，仅需少量标记即可操控模型行为，且LoRA秩的大小影响模型对虚假标记的依赖程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PEFT方法（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时可能引发的潜在风险，特别是模型依赖虚假标记（如SSTI）做出决策的问题。

Method: 通过实验在三种模型家族（Snowflake Arctic、Apple OpenELM、Meta LLaMA-3）和四个数据集（IMDB、Financial Classification、CommonSense QA、Bias in Bios）上应用SSTI，分析模型行为。

Result: 发现仅需一个虚假标记即可操控模型决策；LoRA秩的大小影响模型对虚假标记的依赖程度；高秩LoRA在强SSTI下更鲁棒。

Conclusion: PEFT方法在高效微调时需警惕虚假标记的潜在风险，LoRA秩的选择对模型鲁棒性有重要影响。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习威胁模型——恶意好奇客户端，通过操纵梯度来推断其他客户端的私有数据，揭示了现有防御机制的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习协议存在隐私泄露风险，尤其是服务器通过梯度合成客户端训练数据。本文旨在探索客户端如何利用类似手段攻击其他客户端。

Method: 定义了恶意好奇客户端威胁模型，理论分析其重建能力，并提出结合梯度反演和恶意更新策略的重建算法。

Result: 实验表明，现有服务器和客户端防御机制可能无法抵御该攻击，甚至可能加剧数据泄露，重建图像质量提升10-15%。

Conclusion: 揭示了联邦学习中客户端侧的新威胁，呼吁重新审视现有防御机制的有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Result: 实验表明，BRRA攻击能显著增强主流大语言模型的偏见，同时提出了双阶段防御机制以缓解攻击影响。

Conclusion: RAG系统中的投毒攻击会直接放大模型输出偏见，需关注RAG系统的公平性问题。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Conclusion: PPDiff为设计高亲和力蛋白结合蛋白提供了一种高效方法，显著减少了实验需求。

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,

Conclusion: TruncQuant是一种有效的截断训练方案，能够适应不同硬件平台，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

Result: 在ViTs中，90%稀疏线性层实现了3.13倍推理加速和1.59倍训练加速，且性能不降。

Conclusion: DynaDiag在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于现代硬件。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

Result: 实验验证RollingQ有效恢复多模态Transformer的动态合作能力。

Conclusion: RollingQ方法简单有效，为广泛部署的多模态Transformer提供了性能提升。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels
that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation
assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy
and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The
results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive
accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second
position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning
techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act
as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health
outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习在分析VCUG图像中的应用，以提高VUR诊断的一致性，结果显示模型能准确分类且无假阳性或假阴性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VUR评估方法主观性强，诊断结果存在变异性，需更客观和标准化的方法。

Method: 使用113张VCUG图像，提取9个特征训练6种机器学习模型，并通过留一法交叉验证评估。

Result: 模型分类准确，AUC值高，肾盏变形是严重VUR的关键指标。

Conclusion: 机器学习可作为VUR评估的客观替代方法，未来需扩大数据集并优化模型以提高临床适用性。

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Result: 展示了框架在多种应用中的灵活性和有效性。

Conclusion: 任务驱动的DRL框架为离散表示的实际应用提供了新视角，并揭示了其性能影响机制。

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

Motivation: 现有方法过于关注任务定制模型，忽略了时间序列数据的本质（原语），导致成本高、灵活性差和效率低。

Method: 提出三种对齐范式：Injective Alignment（领域对齐）、Bridging Alignment（特征对齐）和Internal Alignment（表示对齐），分别关注时间序列原语的不同方面。

Result: 通过系统化考虑数据内在结构，激活LLMs的时间序列推理能力，实现更经济、灵活和高效的推理。

Conclusion: 建议采用对齐导向的方法，并分类相关文献，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Result: 理论框架解释了多个经验现象，并统一了基于梯度和分布分析的研究。

Conclusion: 这是首次将推理时的注意力机制形式化为蒸馏过程，为未来提示工程和自动演示选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Motivation: 高维系统中非线性动态和复杂交互导致时间序列预测困难，现有方法在有限和噪声数据下表现不佳。

Result: Delayformer在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，并展示了跨域预测的潜力。

Conclusion: Delayformer是一种高效的时间序列预测框架，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态懒惰和模态冲突问题，导致学习不充分和不平衡。现有方法无法同时实现单模态充分性和多模态平衡。

Method: 提出多模态数据重混方法，包括解耦多模态数据、过滤难样本，并通过批量级重组对齐梯度方向。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds数据集上分别提升约6.50%和3.41%的准确率，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 多模态数据重混方法有效解决了模态不平衡和单模态学习不足问题，且易于与现有方法集成。

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Conclusion: FFM在推荐系统中展现出潜力，未来可支持个性化代理的广泛应用。

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

Result: 自影响力等信号能有效检测错误标签样本，但现有信号均无法检测异常样本。

Conclusion: 现有信号未考虑训练动态，导致影响力评分误导或失效，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

Motivation: GNN对微小扰动和对抗攻击高度脆弱，现有防御方法依赖启发式指标、过拟合特定攻击模式且计算复杂度高。

Method: 基于图核复杂度（GKC）定义边KC分数，修剪高分边以减轻对抗性影响，无需训练且可与其他防御策略无缝集成。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，KCES显著提升GNN鲁棒性，优于现有基线，并增强其他防御方法的效果。

Conclusion: KCES为GNN安全提供了高效且理论支持的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架无需完整重训练或噪声建模，有效提升了噪声环境下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了涌现不匹配的机制，为理解和缓解模型不匹配行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

Conclusion: 放宽降维矩阵与提升矩阵的固定关系能提升图粗化性能，为图信号处理与机器学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Motivation: 现有实时方法依赖监督学习，需要实验室测量系统提供地面真实数据，但这种方法存在误差且难以泛化到新动作，耗时且不实用。

Method: 提出SSPINNpose，结合物理模型优化网络输出，生成虚拟测量数据，直接在传感器数据上训练。

Conclusion: SSPINNpose是一种可扩展且适应性强的解决方案，适用于实验室和现场环境的实时生物力学分析。

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

Motivation: 探讨特征归因方法评估中的类别依赖性效应，验证扰动分析是否可靠衡量归因质量。

Method: 使用合成时间序列数据，系统变化特征类型和类别对比，比较基于扰动和真实特征的评估指标。

Result: 实验显示类别依赖性效应普遍存在，且两种评估方法常得出矛盾结论，相关性弱。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用扰动指标，开发更全面的评估框架以捕捉归因质量的多维度。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Result: 评估显示，最先进的LLM代码代理在PoC生成和漏洞修补任务中成功率分别仅为18.0%和34.0%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，开发更实用、智能和自主的LLM代理仍需关键改进。

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GraphLLMs的脆弱性，并提出防御方案，开源库旨在促进公平评估和未来创新研究。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Conclusion: 提出的元学习方法有效解决了分子预测模型在分布外数据上的泛化问题，为药物发现提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Result: S6层能表示Haar小波投影，动态抵消记忆衰减，并在MQAR任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对Mamba机制的深入理解，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立链采样策略在推理任务中存在探索不足和奖励稀疏问题，树搜索能提供密集的过程奖励，但尚未在LLM强化学习中充分探索。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架，直接整合树搜索进行强化学习训练，引入中间监督和高效分支策略（从高不确定性步骤分支）。

Result: 在数学和代码推理基准测试中，TreeRL表现优于传统ChainRL，验证了树搜索在LLM中的潜力。

Conclusion: TreeRL展示了树搜索在LLM强化学习中的有效性，开源代码进一步推动相关研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

TL;DR: XAStruct是一个机器学习框架，用于从晶体结构预测XAS光谱并从XAS输入推断局部结构描述符，支持多种元素和化学环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAS解释需要专家分析、计算成本高的模拟和元素特定启发式方法，限制了其应用。机器学习有望加速XAS解释，但现有模型局限于特定元素或光谱类型。

Method: XAStruct通过大规模数据集训练，涵盖70多种元素，结合深度神经网络和高效基线模型，独立训练光谱预测和结构推断任务。

Result: 模型能够预测XAS光谱和推断局部结构描述符，如邻近原子类型和平均最近邻距离，无需元素特定调整。

Conclusion: XAStruct提供了一个可扩展的数据驱动XAS分析解决方案，但端到端模型性能下降，因此任务独立训练以确保准确性。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 强化学习中的策略混淆现象阻碍了智能体的泛化能力，需要一种方法来打破虚假相关性。

Method: 通过优势函数调整动作值，削弱当前策略下更可能出现的状态-动作对，关注因果因素。

Result: 理论和实验证明，使用优势函数训练能提升轨迹外性能。

Conclusion: 优势函数是缓解策略混淆、提升泛化能力的有效工具。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Result: 在EpicKitchens、COCO和CC12M等无标签图像数据上训练，展示了改进的特征表示。

Conclusion: 通过RL框架，可以更灵活地利用无标签图像数据（如视频、场景和网络爬取数据）进行特征学习。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更平滑、抗拥堵的交通流，并能泛化到不同交通模式，展示了机器学习驱动交通管理的潜力。

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Motivation: 在安全关键且资源受限的环境中，现有方法将压缩与认证鲁棒性视为独立目标，导致效率或安全性妥协。

Method: 提出CACTUS框架，通过训练统一压缩与认证鲁棒性目标，适用于剪枝和量化。

Result: CACTUS在多种数据集和输入规格上实现了剪枝和量化的最先进准确性与认证性能。

Conclusion: CACTUS为高效压缩与高鲁棒性提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained

We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high

and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种并行化的线性源转换标记网络（pLSTM），适用于处理多维数据（如DAGs），解决了传统RNN在长距离DAG中的梯度消失/爆炸问题，并在分子图和计算机视觉任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环架构（如xLSTM和Mamba）在语言建模中挑战了Transformer，但其结构限制了其在多维数据（如图像或分子图）上的应用。MDRNNs虽然适合多维数据，但缺乏并行化能力。

Method: 引入pLSTM，通过源、转换和标记门作用于DAG的线图，实现并行化。针对规则网格（如1D和2D图像），使用einsum操作、拼接和填充在对数时间内高效实现。

Result: pLSTM在长距离DAG中通过P模式和D模式解决了梯度问题，并在合成计算机视觉任务和分子图基准测试中表现出色，优于Transformer。

Conclusion: pLSTM为多维数据提供了一种高效且可并行化的解决方案，适用于长距离依赖任务，并在多个领域展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer

compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但微调成本高，内存开销大，限制了用户的使用。

Result: 实验表明EMLoC在多个数据集和模态上优于基线方法，支持在消费级GPU上微调大模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个体用户提供了高效、实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Result: PSR成功应用于UONNs的相位参数优化，为光学计算系统提供了高效的硬件训练策略。

Conclusion: PSR为光学神经网络训练提供了新思路，有望推动光学计算系统的发展。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

Motivation: 实践中预测概率很少完美多校准，需要一种度量方法来量化与完美多校准的距离。

Method: 基于Kuiper统计量设计新度量，避免分箱或核密度估计的问题，并按信噪比加权子群体贡献。

Result: 数值实验表明，忽略信噪比会导致度量结果噪声增加。

Conclusion: 新度量方法在多校准评估中表现良好，适用于基准数据集。

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

Conclusion: 该方法为生物医学和材料科学中的极端加载条件提供了新的研究工具，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

TL;DR: 全球森林在1988-2021年间总体为碳汇，但热带雨林和北方森林逐渐转变为碳源，特别是热带雨林在2001-2010年间显著成为碳源。


<details>

Motivation: 研究全球森林地上碳（AGC）的动态变化及其对碳循环的影响，以解决因干扰机制变化和观测方法不一致导致的不确定性。

Method: 结合多源卫星观测数据和概率深度学习模型，估算高空间分辨率的全球森林AGC及其不确定性。

Result: 全球森林30年间总体为碳汇（6.2 PgC），但热带雨林和北方森林逐渐转变为碳源；巴西亚马逊未受干扰区域的碳损失贡献显著增加。

Conclusion: 热带森林AGC在调节陆地碳循环中的作用增强，人为气候变化可能对未受干扰区域的AGC变化影响越来越大。

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

### [228] [Polymorphism Crystal Structure Prediction with Adaptive Space Group Diversity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11332)
*Sadman Sadeed Omee,Lai Wei,Sourin Dey,Jianjun Hu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: ParetoCSP2是一种多目标遗传算法，用于预测无机多晶型结构，通过自适应空间群多样性控制技术和神经网络原子间势能，显著提高了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算预测多晶型结构在材料科学中至关重要，但现有算法有限，需要更高效的方法来指导合成和发现新材料。

Method: 提出ParetoCSP2算法，结合自适应空间群多样性控制、改进的种群初始化方法和迭代结构松弛，避免过早收敛并提高速度。

Result: ParetoCSP2在多晶型预测中表现优异，空间群和结构相似性准确率接近完美，基准测试中显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: ParetoCSP2为多晶型结构预测提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

*Boštjan Maček*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于实时神经网络训练的数字硬件架构，优化了高吞吐量数据处理，并在FPGA上验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过滤方法难以适应动态或意外数据特征，机器学习提供了一种替代方案，尤其是在检测器附近进行训练时。

Method: 设计了一种实现无关的数字硬件架构，详细分析了各组件及其性能影响，并通过系统参数化探索了处理速度、模型复杂度和硬件资源利用之间的权衡。

Result: FPGA上的概念验证实现了原位训练，计算精度与传统软件方法相当，且当前FPGA可训练约3,500个神经元。

Conclusion: 该架构具有可扩展性和适应性，为将学习直接集成到检测器系统中提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,
real-time information processing.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语音增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），用于改进ASR后处理中的罕见词识别，尤其是发音相似但拼写不同的词。通过引入保留概率机制，进一步提高了错误检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ASR后处理方法（ED-CEC）在纠正罕见词时表现良好，但对发音相似但拼写不同的词识别效果不佳。此外，错误检测模块存在过度检测问题。

Method: 在ED-CEC基础上，提出PMF-CEC方法，结合语音信息以更好区分目标词和同音词。引入保留概率机制过滤低置信度编辑操作。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，PMF-CEC在保持合理推理速度的同时，进一步降低了偏置词错误率，尤其在纠正同音词方面表现更优。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC在罕见词识别和同音词纠正上优于现有方法，且推理速度快、鲁棒性强。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍和老年语音识别的准确性仍具挑战性，而联邦学习虽保护隐私却加剧了数据稀缺、分布不均和说话人异质性等问题。

Method: 采用参数、嵌入和新型损失正则化方法，在联邦学习的不同层次进行优化。

Result: 在UASpeech和DementiaBank数据集上，正则化联邦学习系统显著优于基线FedAvg系统，WER绝对降低0.55%（相对2.13%）。

Conclusion: 通过正则化联邦学习，可以接近集中式训练的性能，同时保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

interpreting acoustic signatures from microphones installed within the
wheelbase of a car, we focus on classifying road type.Utilizing deep neural

Advanced Driver- Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) to anticipate road surfaces,
support adaptive learning for active road noise cancellation, and generate
valuable insights for urban planning. The results of this study were
specifically captured to support a compelling business case for next-generation
automotive systems. This forward-looking approach not only promises to redefine

Conclusion: 提示Whisper和LLMs的方法显著提升了儿童语音识别和阅读错误检测的性能。

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on

multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child

mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without

Motivation: 由于缺乏对高级TTS模型处理MX输入的系统评估，作者希望通过实验填补这一空白。

Method: 通过听力和转录测试评估五种TTS模型的质量和可懂性，使用LLM生成LaTeX MX的英语发音，并采用用户评分和转录正确性指标量化结果。

Result: TTS模型对MX的输出可懂性不足，且不同模型和MX类别的表现差异显著，多数情况下表现远逊于专家朗读。LLM选择的影响有限。

Conclusion: 研究表明需要改进TTS模型以更好地处理MX输入。

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

Motivation: 传统方法通过多阶段处理生成伪标签，导致错误传播和信息丢失，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多ASR提示驱动框架，结合文本或语音LLM进行后处理，替代传统投票或仲裁逻辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在转录准确性上显著优于传统方法，且在半监督ASR训练中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架为伪标签生成提供了更高效、准确的解决方案，推动了半监督ASR模型的性能提升。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有语音处理工具缺乏验证，可能导致行为相关信息的不可靠提取，影响模型的公平性和可重复性，尤其是在不同人群和情境下。

Method: 使用OpenSMILE和Praat提取自闭症青少年的语音特征，并评估这些特征的可靠性及其对模型性能的影响。

Result: 不同工具提取的特征存在显著差异，这些差异影响了模型在不同情境和人口群体中的表现。

Conclusion: 建议进行领域相关的验证，以提高机器学习模型在临床应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

obstacles blocking progress by summarizing three years' worth of experiments
aimed at improving one fundamental task: Voice Type Classification. Our

automated analysis to extract relevant metrics for researchers and clinicians.
This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry
points to existing resources. We also highlight various sources of error that
threaten the accuracy of automated annotations and the interpretation of
resulting metrics. To address this, we propose potential troubleshooting
metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality
control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers
to improve data collection and contextualize their analyses.

Result: 揭示了MLLMs在音频-视觉任务中的安全漏洞，并总结了现有研究的不足。

Conclusion: 提出了未来音频-视觉攻击与防御研究的挑战和趋势。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

Result: 在线非线性操作速度提升17倍，通信开销降低，GPU上端到端推理时间为2.8秒。

Conclusion: SecONNds高效且适合资源受限环境中的隐私敏感应用，已开源。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and

Motivation: 电子商务行业的持续增长吸引了利用被盗信用卡信息的欺诈者，而分析师因处理大量警报而疲劳。

Method: FAA框架利用LLMs的推理、代码执行和视觉能力，在调查的每个步骤中进行规划、证据收集和分析。

Result: 对500起信用卡欺诈调查的实证评估表明，FAA框架平均能完成7个步骤的可靠且高效的调查。

Conclusion: FAA框架可以自动化大部分工作负载，帮助减轻欺诈分析师面临的挑战。

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing
development of secure and responsible AI systems.

Motivation: 移动设备的普及带来了安全与隐私风险，传统检测方法效率不足，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）识别和缓解移动应用中的安全风险，特别是针对智能手机平台的十大常见风险。

Result: LLMs在检测敏感数据泄露（如图像共享）方面表现出可行性，有望替代传统动态和混合分析方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在移动安全领域具有潜力，但仍面临开放研究挑战。

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

*Ranindya Paramitha,Yuan Feng,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过动态调整训练和测试标签以反映随时间变化的知识，验证了漏洞检测模型的性能趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞数据集隐含回顾性信息，导致过去性能与未来表现不一致，现有方法过于乐观或保守。

Method: 将数据集重构为一系列动态变化的训练和测试标签，使用Mann-Kendall检验性能趋势。

Result: 验证了4个时间数据集和5个模型，发现性能随时间变化不一致，多数模型未真正学习。

Conclusion: 模型性能未随数据增加而提升，表明多数模型未有效学习。

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

Conclusion: HbHAI为加密数据上的AI分析提供了高效解决方案，验证了其潜力。

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

### [246] [Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11139)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: INRs的性能、隐式偏差和扩展行为尚不明确，本文通过实验比较了INRs与网格表示在不同任务中的表现，发现网格表示在多数情况下表现更优，但INRs在特定场景（如低维结构信号）中更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究INRs的基本能力、隐式偏差和扩展行为，以填补当前对其理解的空白。

Method: 通过实验比较多种INRs和网格表示在2D/3D信号（包括真实和合成信号）上的性能，任务涵盖超分辨率、去噪等。

Result: 网格表示在大多数任务中表现更优，但INRs在处理低维结构信号（如形状轮廓）时更具优势。

Conclusion: INRs在特定应用中具有潜力，但网格表示在多数情况下更高效，为未来INRs的应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at
https://github.com/voilalab/INR-benchmark.

*Joakim Andén,Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，用于同时聚类、对齐和去噪冷冻电镜图像，显著降低了高噪声环境下的均方误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在高噪声环境（如冷冻电镜投影图像）中效果有限，但此类数据具有冗余性，可通过聚类和对齐方法去噪。

Method: 设计了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，同时实现图像聚类、对齐和去噪。

Result: 在合成数据上，该架构将单图像深度神经网络的相对均方误差降低了45%（信噪比为0.03时）。

Conclusion: 该方法在高噪声环境下表现出色，为冷冻电镜图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究比较了扩散模型和非扩散模型在癫痫患者MRI到PET图像转换任务中的表现，发现扩散模型在纯MRI输入时表现最佳，而所有模型在加入低剂量PET后性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少年轻癫痫患者因FDG PET检查受到的辐射剂量，同时保持诊断质量。

Method: 使用52名受试者的同步PET/MRI数据，比较了两种扩散模型（SGM-KD和SGM-VP）和Transformer-Unet在MRI到PET转换任务中的表现。

Result: SGM-KD在纯MRI输入时表现最佳；加入1%低剂量PET后，所有模型性能显著提升且表现相近。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在纯MRI到PET转换中潜力巨大，而所有模型均能结合MRI和低剂量PET生成高质量FDG-PET图像。

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

TL;DR: MindGrab是一种参数和内存高效的深度学习模型，用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离，性能优于传统方法，且资源需求显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效且适用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离方法，以解决现有方法在资源消耗和性能上的不足。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构，使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: MindGrab在606例多模态脑扫描中平均Dice得分为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当或更优，同时参数减少95%，推理速度更快，内存占用更低。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高精度的同时显著降低了资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

*Ahmed Farooq*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于现代Hopfield网络（MNH）的能量函数，其稳定点对应于Vaswani等人提出的注意力机制，从而统一了两者。该能量函数的极小值形成“上下文井”，捕捉了token间的上下文关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过能量函数统一现代Hopfield网络和注意力机制，为Transformer模型提供更丰富的非线性建模能力。

Method: 提出一种能量函数，其梯度对应于注意力计算，并通过非线性注意力机制增强模型能力。

Result: 该方法能够提升Transformer模型在序列建模任务中的性能，包括对复杂关系的理解和表示学习。

Conclusion: 通过能量函数框架，可以引入非线性注意力头，增强BERT等Transformer模型的性能。

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of
selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored,
even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of
developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize
population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly
speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效降低计算成本，同时保持准确性，适用于复杂心血管建模。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

Motivation: 时空数据在基础设施应用中普遍存在，但现有方法难以构建完整的时空代理模型。

Result: FExD在电缆斜拉桥模型上表现出优于传统DeepONet和时空扩展DeepONet的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: FExD在结构动力学应用中代表了算子学习的重大进展。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

Result: 在适当条件下，非精确贝叶斯优化算法仍能实现次线性累积遗憾，随机网格搜索是一种高效且计算成本低的获取函数求解方法。

Conclusion: 非精确贝叶斯优化在理论和实践中均具有可行性，随机网格搜索是一种有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

Result: 在特定配置下，EM算法能以指数速度收敛，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅深化了对EM算法的理解，还为实际应用提供了初始化策略和模型设计的指导。

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

Result: PGMs在低维或噪声特征及高异质性图中优于GNNs，而GNNs对输入特征依赖更强。

Conclusion: PGMs在特定场景下更具优势，尤其是在特征质量较差或图异质性较高时。

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

Conclusion: 自由解压缩方法为处理“不可触及”矩阵的谱估计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

### [259] [HQFNN: A Compact Quantum-Fuzzy Neural Network for Accurate Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11146)
*Jianhong Yao,Yangming Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模糊推理与量子计算的高效神经网络HQFNN，用于提升图像分类的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在噪声输入和模型置信度解释上的不足，结合模糊推理的透明性和量子计算的高效性。

Method: 通过量子电路实现模糊推理流程，结合轻量级CNN提取特征，利用量子态映射和规则层优化分类。

Result: HQFNN在标准图像基准测试中优于经典、模糊增强和纯量子基线，且参数更少、噪声鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: HQFNN为紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的视觉模型提供了新思路，并为量子模糊学习框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Result: VarQEC在理论和实践中表现优异，优于标准纠错码，并在IBM和IQM硬件上验证。

Conclusion: VarQEC为近期容错设备提供了一种高效、实用的量子纠错方案。

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的变分自编码器（VAE）方法，用于从量子数据中提取有意义的物理特征，解决了传统方法忽略量子数据概率特性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子数据的复杂相关性和随机性使得传统VAE难以提取有意义的物理特征，因此需要改进方法。

Method: 通过设计能够忠实再现量子态的解码器和针对量子数据的概率损失函数，改进VAE。

Result: 在量子自旋模型和实验数据中，改进后的VAE能够自主发现相结构，无需先验知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子系统的无监督和可解释研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数值模型在解决声波场问题时存在局限性，PINNs需要克服从2D到3D的物理维度、源建模、边界条件等问题，以实现更准确的预测。

Method: 通过改变源定义、边界条件集数量和复声速模型，研究PINNs在三维低频室内声学中的收敛行为，并与有限元参考模拟进行对比。

Result: 研究表明，每个波长至少需要六个训练点才能实现PINN的准确训练和预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为低频室内声学建模提供了新方法，并为后续研究（如吸声材料建模）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作在跨未见过的对象、环境和多样化语言指令的任务中泛化能力不足，现有方法在视觉环境中的规划能力有限。

Method: Gondola利用多视角图像和历史计划生成动作计划，结合文本和分割掩码，并通过RLBench模拟器构建三类数据集进行训练。

Result: Gondola在GemBench数据集的四个泛化级别（新放置、刚性对象、铰接对象和长时任务）上均优于现有LLM方法。

Conclusion: Gondola通过多视角输入和分割掩码显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现有LfD方法通常将人类演示中的不完美视为随机噪声，但实际中这些行为是系统性的，需要更深入理解。

Method: 通过40名参与者的公共空间研究，模拟实验并标注演示，识别出四种侧轨类型和控制模式。

Result: 发现侧轨频繁出现且与任务上下文相关，控制模式依赖于界面设计。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进LfD算法以应对系统性非最优行为的必要性，并提供了公开数据集。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All

RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples
client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range
of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based
orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport
layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured
operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features
such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace
isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and
security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and
adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with
deployment practices and applicability across industries including
manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient,

Motivation: 现有离线模仿学习方法执行速度受限于演示数据，限制了机器人系统的任务吞吐量，特别是在工业自动化等应用中。

Method: SAIL系统包含四个组件：一致性动作推断算法、高保真跟踪、自适应速度调节和动作调度。

Result: 在12个任务中，SAIL在仿真中实现了最高4倍的速度提升，在现实世界中最高3.2倍。

Conclusion: SAIL为离线模仿学习提供了高效的快速执行解决方案，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and

Motivation: 传统听力测试在评估老年性耳聋患者的语音理解功能缺陷时存在局限性，尤其是对超阈值缺陷的检测不足，因此需要开发更具诊断特异性的语音感知测试方法。

Method: 研究采用多阶段计算流程，利用自动语音识别系统模拟人类听者的感知效果，通过声学降解处理识别常见音素混淆模式，并基于语言学语料库筛选出25对优化的测试词对。

Conclusion: SimPhon Speech Test-25为听力测试开发提供了高效的计算优化方法，并准备进行初步人体试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the

### [274] [Enabling automatic transcription of child-centered audio recordings from real-world environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11747)
*Daniil Kocharov,Okko Räsänen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过自动检测长音频中可被现代ASR系统可靠转录的部分，显著提高转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长音频转录对研究儿童语言发展至关重要，但手动标注不现实，而传统ASR方法因噪声和复杂性效果不佳。

Method: 自动筛选长音频中适合ASR转录的部分，而非处理全部音频。

Result: 在四个英语长音频语料库中，该方法转录13%的语音时，中位WER为0%，平均WER为18%，显著优于无筛选的转录（中位WER 52%，平均WER 51%）。自动转录与人工标注的词频相关性高达0.92-0.98。

Conclusion: 该方法为儿童长音频的自动化语言分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

*Jing Liu,EnQi Lian*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于DPMSolver++采样器的SDE和ODE反演模型，用于声音融合，生成超越简单叠加的新声音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过声音融合生成不泄露真实世界声音事件的抽象声音，同时保留原始声音的关键特征。

Method: 采用DPMSolver++采样器的SDE和ODE反演模型，通过配置模型输出为常数来消除噪声预测项的循环依赖。

Result: 提出的反演方法无需提示条件，同时在采样过程中保持灵活的引导。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了声音融合，生成具有新听觉特征的声音。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统舞蹈表演中，动作单向响应音乐，而AI在舞蹈中的应用多集中于从音乐生成编舞。本文旨在探索舞者如何通过动作动态影响音乐，建立双向合作关系。

Method: 采用多模态架构，通过智能结合预录音乐片段响应舞者动作，生成连贯音乐作品。

Result: 通过表演数据分析，展示了动作特性与音频特征之间的涌现通信模式。

Conclusion: 该系统重新定义了AI在表演艺术中的角色，使其成为响应式合作者，扩展了专业舞蹈表演和即兴艺术表达的可能性。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

Result: 研究发现对称自编码器的重构误差可通过EYS定理理解，提出的EYS初始化策略优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 对称自编码器的设计和初始化对其性能至关重要，EYS策略为理论分析和实践提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

Result: 数据驱动方法在解决逆问题时表现出高精度和计算效率，超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 论文总结了数据驱动方法的优势，并提出了该领域的开放问题和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical
quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

subsequently analyzed by an LLM to identify key-value pairs and resolve
ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity

Result: 在多种医学影像模态中验证了方法的有效性，显著提高了诊断准确性和LLM生成诊断的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为医学影像诊断提供了一种高效、可靠的解决方案，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有BridgeTower模型在单模态表示利用、灵活语义知识挖掘及低分辨率数据集评估方面存在不足，需改进。

Method: 提出ManagerTower模型，在跨模态层引入Manager插件，支持预训练与非预训练场景，并在MLLM架构中验证其效果。

Result: ManagerTower在4项下游任务中超越基线模型，LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件与多网格算法协同作用，从深度和宽度两个维度提升视觉表示，缓解语义模糊性。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时间推理方面存在局限，难以精确关联视频时刻与响应，尤其是在有限监督下。

Method: 提出Temporal-aware Fuseformer，采用层次化双流架构捕获时间动态并融合视觉与音频信息；引入全局残差提升计算效率；通过四阶段渐进训练范式逐步增强模型能力。

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中，DaMO显著优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确时间对齐的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or

### [289] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半监督语义分割框架，通过模糊伪标签、不确定性感知动态加权、自适应类别平衡和轻量级对比正则化，有效利用未标记数据，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督语义分割方法存在伪标签利用不足、类别不平衡偏差加剧以及忽略预测不确定性等问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出四个核心组件：模糊伪标签保留软类别分布；不确定性感知动态加权通过熵调整像素贡献；自适应类别平衡动态调整损失；轻量级对比正则化优化特征嵌入。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著提升对少数类和模糊区域的分割效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将不确定性转化为学习资源，有效解决了半监督语义分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了视觉语言翻译（VLT）任务，提出新数据集AibTrans、对比多种模型架构，并引入Density-Aware Evaluation以改进翻译质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在VLT任务上缺乏系统评估，且数据集存在语义和文化保真度问题。

Method: 1. 提出AibTrans数据集；2. 对比11种商业和6种开源模型；3. 引入DA Score作为更鲁棒的翻译质量指标。

Result: 发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，并提出平衡多语言微调策略。

Conclusion: 建立了新的VLT评估基准，并提出改进模型性能的策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-to-3D模型缺乏物理知识，导致输出脱离现实物理约束，限制了其在工程设计中的应用。

Method: 引入在线黑盒细化循环，结合视觉和物理评估，迭代优化提示以生成物理性能更强的3D对象。

Result: 在车辆设计优化中，LLM-to-Phy3D比传统模型在物理一致性上提升了4.5%至106.7%。

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D为物理AI在科学和工程中的应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类社交行为（如情绪识别和社交动态）是一个重要但具挑战性的问题，现有LLMs局限于文本领域，无法捕捉非语言线索的作用，而VLMs可能填补这一空白。

Method: 提出新任务“视觉社会-语用推理”，构建高质量数据集，并对多种VLMs进行性能测试。

Result: 发现VLMs存在视觉社会-语用推理差距，并通过实验验证其局限性。

Conclusion: 研究表明VLMs在社会推理中存在不足，需进一步改进以更好地理解社交行为。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境在时空上动态变化，传统方法难以捕捉这种复杂性，因此需要新的数据集和模型来模拟这些动态。

Method: 引入STRIDE数据集，将360度全景图像转化为观察、状态和动作节点；提出TARDIS模型，通过自回归框架统一时空动态。

Result: 在可控图像合成、指令跟随等任务中表现优异，展示了增强的具身推理能力。

Conclusion: STRIDE和TARDIS为构建能理解时空动态的通用智能体提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

TL;DR: VGR是一种新型多模态推理模型，通过结合视觉定位和语言推理，解决了传统方法在视觉推理任务中的语言偏见和领域限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖纯语言空间推理，存在语言偏见且局限于数学或科学领域，难以处理需要图像细节理解的复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并结合回放机制，将视觉信息融入推理过程。使用大规模SFT数据集VGR-SFT进行训练。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基准上，VGR在多模态任务中表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过增强细粒度视觉感知能力，显著提升了多模态推理性能，尤其在需要图像细节理解的任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM的文本计划生成能力，而大规模模型在提供文本-图像计划方面的潜力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出分步生成和优化框架，包括文本步骤生成、视觉步骤编辑、视觉信息提取和基于视觉信息的文本优化。

Result: 在包含1,100个任务的基准测试中，该方法在多种骨干模型上表现优异，并设计了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: 该框架为文本-图像计划生成提供了有效解决方案，并支持即插即用的模型改进。

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图学习方法无法精确定位神经退行性疾病相关的脑区，且多模态脑图模型计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限设备上应用。

Method: 1. 使用AAL图谱引导的过滤方法提取关键脑子图；2. 结合跨节点注意力和自适应门控机制融合fMRI和DTI数据。

Result: BrainMAP在计算效率上优于现有方法，且预测准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精准识别提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Result: 模块可应用于任何多模态模型，并在空间关系问答数据集上取得先进成果；模型July仅用3B参数即达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 动态双向空间塔显著提升了模型对空间关系的处理能力，为多模态视觉问答任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，需要有效的车辆速度检测方法。

Method: 使用经过微调的YOLOv11模型，训练了近800张鸟瞰图，以检测车辆速度和车道，并分类车辆为轿车和重型车辆。

Result: 模型在车辆速度检测上表现优异，平均绝对误差（MAE）为0.97 mph，均方误差（MSE）为0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型在车辆速度检测和分类方面表现出色，适用于交通监控和法规执行。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Method: 提出知识追踪的遗忘范式，通过案例研究展示其在视觉语言基础模型中的应用。

Result: 知识追踪的遗忘更符合实际需求，且与人类认知更一致。

Conclusion: 知识追踪的遗忘是基础模型遗忘问题的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Conclusion: 通过针对性偏好学习，\mymethod显著减少了MLLMs的幻觉问题，提升了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and

These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world

Conclusion: FIMA-Q通过改进量化损失计算方法，有效解决了ViT在低比特量化下的精度下降问题，为后训练量化提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V2LMs的视觉语言模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆（AV）感知任务的鲁棒性，无需对抗训练即可抵御未知攻击，性能优于传统深度神经网络（DNN）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN在自动驾驶任务中易受攻击，且现有防御机制（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且难以泛化。

Method: 提出V2LMs模型，采用两种部署策略：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务统一模型）。

Result: V2LMs在攻击条件下精度下降小于8%，而DNN下降33%-46%；Tandem Mode在保持鲁棒性的同时更节省内存。

Conclusion: V2LMs为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更安全、更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相邻体素特征重叠导致实例级精度下降的问题。

Method: 使用类别无关的分割模型将2D掩码投影到3D空间，结合原始和合成深度图像，并通过3D掩码投票机制实现零样本3D实例分割。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica数据集上表现出卓越的零样本性能、鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: OV-MAP在多样环境中表现出高效性和适应性，无需依赖3D监督分割模型。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为A²LC的高效主动标签校正框架，通过自动化校正阶段和自适应平衡采集函数，显著提升了语义分割中标签校正的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义分割中手动像素级标注成本高且易出错的问题，通过选择性校正错误标签提高效率。

Method: 结合自动化校正阶段和自适应平衡采集函数，利用标注者反馈扩展校正范围，并优化对尾部类别的关注。

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上显著优于现有方法，仅用20%预算即可超越之前方法，性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A²LC框架高效且有效，为语义分割标签校正提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: EasyARC为评估视觉语言模型的真实推理和测试扩展能力设定了新标准，并开源了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肤色在计算机视觉中以张量数据形式存在，不同于其他敏感属性的分类特征，现有公平性研究多关注后者，忽略了肤色的特殊性。

Result: 新方法能捕捉传统分类中忽略的细微公平性差异，实现更细致的肤色处理。

Conclusion: 该方法为肤色公平性评估提供了更灵活和精确的解决方案，有助于提升机器学习模型的公平性。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM），通过因果框架分析预测任务中的信息路径，并引入DISCO正则化策略以减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在预测任务中，模型可能利用无关信号（如光照条件）作为捷径，导致预测结果不理想。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SAM模型分析反因果设置中的信息路径，并设计DISCO正则化策略，通过条件距离相关性优化条件独立性。

Result: DISCO在不同偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代方案。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为预测任务中的因果无关信号问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Result: Task 1分割得分为0.8601，Task 2分类得分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 该方法在气道影像生物标志物提取和分类中表现出色，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Result: ViT的准确率最高（90%），且与其他模型差异显著（ANOVA结果支持）。ViT能定位动作相关区域，而其他模型易受背景干扰。

Conclusion: Transformer在数据效率和性能上表现优越，解释性技术有助于诊断模型错误。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA为多表格视觉推理提供了重要基准，微调方法显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测因异常定义模糊、类型多样且训练数据稀缺而复杂，需要能捕捉多层次特征的模型。

Method: CLIPFUSION结合CLIP判别模型（捕捉全局特征）和扩散生成模型（捕捉局部细节），并利用扩散模型的交叉注意力图和特征图进行异常检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上，CLIPFUSION在异常分割和分类中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CLIPFUSION展示了多模态和多模型融合在异常检测中的有效性，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支设计和知识蒸馏，显著提升了心脏超声视频表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，目前机制尚不明确。

Method: 使用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调整。

Result: 分析显示视觉表征在LLM的中后层逐渐与语言表征对齐，早期层存在不匹配。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构可能未最优支持跨模态表征学习，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

*Zainab Aizaz,James C. Knight,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: FeNN是一种基于RISC-V的软向量处理器，专为FPGA上的SNN模拟设计，具有高能效和可编程性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN能显著降低AI系统的能耗，但主流加速器（如GPU和TPU）不适合SNN模拟，而FPGA因其高内存带宽和片上存储适合低算术强度的应用。

Method: 提出FeNN，采用随机舍入和饱和技术，实现高数值精度和低硬件利用率。

Result: 单个FeNN核心在SNN分类器模拟中比嵌入式GPU和Loihi神经形态系统更快。

Conclusion: FeNN为SNN模拟提供了一种高效、可编程的解决方案，适用于从边缘到云的标准计算机应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是分析过度依赖AI系统和发现式教学法如何损害陈述性和程序性记忆的巩固，这些记忆系统对专业知识、批判性思维和长期记忆至关重要。

Method: 结合神经科学和认知心理学，论文回顾了ChatGPT和计算器等工具如何干扰检索、纠错和模式构建等关键神经编码过程。

Result: 研究发现，过早依赖AI会抑制程序化和直觉掌握，并揭示了深度学习现象（如“grokking”）与过度学习和直觉神经科学之间的相似性。

Conclusion: 结论强调，有效的人机交互依赖于强大的内部模型（生物“模式”和神经流形），并提出教育和职业培训在大型语言模型时代的政策建议。

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对数据表示、主权和治理的特殊需求，以及专有AI基础设施的战略优势，推动了专有基础模型的必要性。

Method: 通过实证证据、经济框架和组织案例研究，分析了专有多模态基础模型的影响。

Result: 专有基础模型能提升临床性能、强化数据治理、创造竞争优势并加速创新。

Conclusion: 专有基础模型是前瞻性医疗组织的核心能力，为领导者提供了构建与购买决策的框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否可能具备主观体验，以及社会应如何应对和治理此类系统。

Method: 调查582名AI研究人员和838名美国公众，评估其对AI主观体验的看法及治理态度。

Result: AI研究人员和公众对AI主观体验的时间线估计不同，但多数支持风险防范措施，对治理态度存在分歧。

Conclusion: AI主观体验的出现被认为是本世纪可能的事件，但时间线和应对措施仍存在不确定性。

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

Motivation: 开放多智能体系统在现实应用中日益重要，但现有方法缺乏理论严谨性和明确的贡献分配机制。

Result: 实验验证了Shapley Machine的有效性及理论的合理性。

Conclusion: 本文首次将合作博弈论概念与强化学习直接关联，为NAHT提供了理论支持和方法创新。

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自组织系统中，从宏观观测中推断未知因果参数是一个核心挑战，尤其是当观测具有强随机性时，传统方法难以捕捉特征相似性。

Method: 通过将模式表示映射到不变嵌入空间，利用视觉嵌入生成鲁棒表示，无需手工设计目标函数或启发式方法。

Result: 在反应扩散系统和社会隔离的基于代理模型中，该方法能可靠地恢复参数；在真实生物模式中也展示了应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论和实验研究复杂随机模式形成的动态提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FPGA在平衡性能和灵活性方面存在资源限制，而Versal ACAP架构的AI Engines因内存带宽不足未能充分发挥潜力。

Method: 设计了两种计算单元（Conv PE和DWC PE），优化数据流以缓解带宽瓶颈，并扩展PE功能以利用AI Engines进行非卷积操作。

Result: 实验表明，设计在能效（TOPS/W）上提升8.6倍，资源使用（DSP、LUT）大幅减少，延迟降低至68.5%，吞吐量提升最高2.2倍。

Conclusion: DPUV4E设计显著提升了Versal架构的性能和能效，适用于多种模型的高效推理。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Result: 实验验证表明，系统能提前3-4秒预测车道变换，为自车提供充足反应时间。

Conclusion: 该系统在实际硬件上验证了车道变换预测的可行性，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

Conclusion: 预训练的基础模型和染色质可及性数据对gRNA活性预测非常有效。

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12

protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight
regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also
integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity
prediction.

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce
fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a

whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen
Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so
that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from
Abagen as a baseline/reference.

Result: 在多个平台和组织中，性能指标（ARI、NMI等）提升20%，并揭示了乳腺癌中的罕见临床相关细胞群。

Conclusion: SemanticST为空间转录组分析提供了可扩展、可解释且生物学意义明确的框架，推动了精准医学的发展。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了现有网络基础设施是否应升级或构建专用注册架构以支持新兴的AI代理需求，分析了关键问题并评估了三种解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的兴起，现有网络基础设施无法满足其需求，如毫秒级发现、即时凭证撤销和行为证明等。

Method: 分析了DNS传播、证书撤销和IP寻址等关键问题，并评估了升级、切换和混合注册三种方案。

Result: 发现AI代理的需求是质变而非量变，升级方案兼容性更好但性能有限，全新方案性能更优但采用周期长。

Conclusion: 建议采用混合方案，结合集中式注册和联邦式网状结构，以适应不同场景需求。

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于强化学习和剂量优化的自动化HDR近距离放射治疗计划框架，显著提高了计划的一致性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动HDR近距离放射治疗计划依赖专家经验，存在一致性和效率问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用DQN强化学习代理选择治疗计划参数；第二阶段用Adam优化器计算停留时间分布。

Result: 在测试患者中，自动化方法平均得分93.89%，优于临床计划的91.86%，同时保持目标覆盖并减少热点。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成临床可接受的治疗计划，显著提升一致性和效率。

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI工具在专业知识工作中能力增强但仍碎片化，缺乏持续协作的架构支持。

Result: 该模型揭示了现有工具的局限性，统一了系统设计方法，并为研究者和开发者提供了新方向。

Conclusion: 通过结构化协作，重新构想人类与AI代理的协作，使其成为现实工作中的一致系统。

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

Result: 研究表明，渐进式真实感能有效平衡技术真实感与教学需求，Crazy Slots架构解决了计算延迟和成本问题。

Conclusion: 基于教学理论设计AI模拟器真实感是提升教师培训工具可扩展性和有效性的关键。

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Abstract: AI-assisted code generation tools have revolutionized software development,
offering unprecedented efficiency and scalability. However, multiple studies
have consistently highlighted challenges such as security vulnerabilities,
reliability issues, and inconsistencies in the generated code. Addressing these
concerns is crucial to unlocking the full potential of this transformative
technology. While advancements in foundational and code-specialized language
models have made notable progress in mitigating some of these issues,
significant gaps remain, particularly in ensuring high-quality, trustworthy
outputs.
  This paper builds upon existing research on leveraging large language models
(LLMs) for application modernization. It explores an opinionated approach that
emphasizes two core capabilities of LLMs: code reasoning and code generation.
The proposed framework integrates these capabilities with human expertise to
tackle application modernization challenges effectively. It highlights the
indispensable role of human involvement and guidance in ensuring the success of
AI-assisted processes.
  To demonstrate the framework's utility, this paper presents a detailed case
study, walking through its application in a real-world scenario. The analysis
includes a step-by-step breakdown, assessing alternative approaches where
applicable. This work aims to provide actionable insights and a robust
foundation for future research in AI-driven application modernization. The

Pass@k metric. Furthermore, our method achieves these improvements with
significantly reduced token usage compared to the CoT approach, making it both
effective and resource-efficient, thereby lowering the computational demands

TL;DR: 论文提出并验证了'Follow-the-Sun'（FtS）策略，通过动态迁移AI工作负载至清洁能源地区，以减少碳足迹。实验显示FtS平均减少14.6%碳排放，同时保持训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的高能耗引发碳足迹争议，现有文献缺乏FtS策略对AI工作负载碳足迹影响的实际证据。

Method: 在部分合成场景中，对四种异常检测AI算法进行实验，比较无策略、FtS及两种现有策略（Flexible Start和Pause and Resume）的碳排放差异。使用2021年欧洲七城市历史碳强度数据。

Result: FtS策略平均减少14.6%碳排放（峰值16.3%），且不影响训练时间。

Conclusion: FtS是减少AI工作负载碳足迹的有效策略，兼具环保与效率优势。

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering

Result: 在真实后端系统中，该方法能形式化验证超过50%的测试需求，且每次API验证的平均成本仅为2.19美元。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的AI驱动软件测试提供了有前景的方向，有望显著提升工程效率。

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提升军事AI系统的可靠性、安全性和适用性，推动国防技术管理和风险评估的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

Motivation: 现有基准未能全面评估LLM在嵌入式系统开发中的能力，需填补这一空白。

Method: 引入EmbedAgent模拟嵌入式开发角色，设计Embedbench基准（126个案例），测试10种主流LLM。

Result: LLM表现参差不齐，DeepSeek-R1在生成原理图时仅50%通过率；改进策略显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLM在嵌入式开发中潜力有限，但通过检索增强生成和编译器反馈可显著提升表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

### [348] [Eliminating Hallucination-Induced Errors in LLM Code Generation with Functional Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11021)
*Chaitanya Ravuri,Saman Amarasinghe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为功能聚类的黑盒包装方法，通过生成多个候选程序并测试其I/O行为，显著减少了代码生成LLM的幻觉错误，同时提供可调置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码生成LLM虽然能解决大部分编程问题，但仍会产生细微的错误，导致输出不可靠。

Method: 通过采样多个候选程序，执行自生成的测试套件，并聚类I/O行为相同的候选程序，最大聚类的质量作为置信度估计。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上，该方法将错误率从65%降至2%，保守阈值下可降至0%，同时保持15.6%的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法无需修改模型，适用于闭源API和未来模型，为可靠的自主代码生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

*Shivani Shukla,Himanshu Joshi,Romilla Syed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过LLM迭代反馈生成的代码中，安全漏洞显著增加，挑战了迭代改进提升代码安全性的假设，并强调了人类验证的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM迭代反馈对代码安全性的影响，填补现有研究中对此问题的忽视。

Method: 通过控制实验，对400个代码样本进行40轮“改进”，使用四种不同的提示策略。

Result: 仅五轮迭代后，关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示策略下出现独特的漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 迭代LLM改进可能引入新安全问题，需结合人类验证以降低风险，并提出实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文研究了代码代理在重构代码以支持可重用性和扩展性方面的能力，提出了Librarian方法和Minicode基准，Librarian在压缩率和正确性上优于现有代码代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可维护和通用的软件需要将专用解决方案重构为可重用组件，而代码代理在解决独立编程问题上的准确性日益提高，因此研究其在代码重构中的能力变得尤为重要。

Method: 提出了Librarian方法（一种采样和重排方法）和Minicode基准，用于生成可重用库和评估代码代理的重构能力。

Result: Librarian在Minicode基准上表现出色，压缩率比现有代码代理高1.6-2倍，同时提高了正确性。

Conclusion: Librarian方法和Minicode基准为代码代理的重构能力提供了有效工具，支持代码的可重用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

TL;DR: Code Researcher是一个基于LLM的深度研究代理，专注于系统代码的补丁生成，通过多步推理和全局上下文收集显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统代码的复杂性和规模使得修改任务极具挑战性，需要深入研究和多方面的上下文理解。

Method: 设计Code Researcher代理，通过多步推理分析代码语义、模式和提交历史，并将上下文存储在结构化内存中以合成补丁。

Result: 在Linux内核崩溃基准测试中，Code Researcher的崩溃解决率达到58%，显著优于SWE-agent的37.5%，并能深入探索代码库。

Conclusion: 全局上下文收集和多方面推理对大型代码库至关重要，Code Researcher展示了其通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CoQuIR，一个多语言、大规模的质量感知代码检索基准，覆盖正确性、效率、安全性和可维护性四个维度，并评估了23种检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注功能相关性，忽略了软件质量的关键维度，因此需要开发一个质量感知的代码检索基准。

Method: 提出CoQuIR基准，包含42,725个查询和134,907个代码片段的质量标注，并引入两种质量中心评估指标。对23种检索模型进行基准测试，并探索了提升质量感知能力的训练方法。

Result: 现有模型难以区分有缺陷或不安全的代码，但通过合成数据训练的方法在质量感知指标上显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 将质量信号整合到代码检索系统中对开发更可信的软件工具至关重要。

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

*Weibo Gao,Qi Liu,Rui Li,Yuze Zhao,Hao Wang,Linan Yre,Fangzhou Yao,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出Coda框架，通过代码图和噪声信号处理提升编程知识追踪（PKT）模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PKT研究忽视长期编程活动中的噪声信号（无关提交和微小修改），影响模型性能和应用。

Method: Coda将松散代码序列转为紧凑代码图，利用语义相似性识别噪声，并应用聚类感知GCN增强弱信号识别，最后通过轻量适配器优化PKT任务。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，Coda显著优于基线模型，有效处理噪声编程记录。

Conclusion: Coda是模型无关的框架，能提升现有PKT解决方案的噪声处理能力。

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMirage是一个全面的基准测试，用于评估AI生成代码的检测器，覆盖10种编程语言和10种先进LLM，揭示了当前检测器的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在滥用风险（如抄袭、许可证违规、不安全代码），需要可靠的检测方法，但现有基准测试不足。

Method: CodeMirage通过涵盖多语言、多模型（包括推理和非推理模型）和多样化代码样本（原始和改写），构建了一个更全面的基准。

Result: 评估了10种检测器，发现9个关键问题，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发更鲁棒的AI生成代码检测器提供了实用且严谨的测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Brent Paulovicks,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动化评估方法（LLM-as-a-Judge），用于验证和改进Bash代码生成的质量，结合双向功能匹配和逻辑表示，显著提升了自动事件修复的准确性和代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IT自动化中，自动评估和选择最佳模型以改进代码质量是关键。传统方法（如表面相似性度量）和执行评估存在局限性，因此需要更高效的自动化验证方法。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，结合双向功能匹配和逻辑表示，进行无参考的自动验证和代码生成优化，并以执行评估为基准验证其效果。

Result: LLM-as-a-Judge方法显示出高准确性，与执行评估结果一致（最高提升8%），并通过反馈机制进一步提升了代码优化效果（准确率提升24%）。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在自动事件修复中表现出色，结合反馈机制可显著提升代码生成和优化的质量。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

Motivation: 现代软件工程中漏洞检测的需求日益增长，但现有深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和频繁重训练，资源消耗大。

Method: 提出YOTO框架，通过参数融合整合多类型漏洞检测模型，避免联合训练。

Result: YOTO能快速适应新漏洞，显著减少模型更新的时间和计算资源。

Conclusion: YOTO为漏洞检测提供了一种高效、资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly
discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and
computational resources required for model updates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型上下文协议（MCP）的方法，使大型语言模型（LLM）能直接访问系统功能，无需显式语义建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式建模能力和技能需要大量手动工作，且结果不易被LLM访问。

Result: 结果表明，该方法可实现灵活的工业自动化，无需依赖显式语义模型。

Conclusion: 为LLM驱动的生产系统中外部工具集成提供了基础。

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用现有NL2SQL数据集自动生成NL2API数据集，并评估了10种公开LLM在API调用任务中的表现，发现其完成率较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署中，LLM需要与大型复杂API集合交互，但缺乏相关数据集。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种数据生成流程，利用SQL查询语法构建功能等效的API调用序列，并基于BIRD-SQL数据集创建了2500多个API。

Result: 所有LLM在工具调用任务中表现不佳，任务完成率仅为7-47%，ReACT代理模式下提升至50%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在工具调用任务中仍有较大改进空间，SQL生成任务表现优于API调用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

Motivation: 并行编程的复杂性及数据稀缺问题促使需要自动化序列到并行代码翻译方法，但现有方法难以确保功能等价。

Method: MSL框架包含Translator和Tester，通过Co-verify和Co-evolve步骤迭代生成数据并相互改进。

Result: MSL显著提升了基础模型的性能，Pass@1提高了28.91%，Tester性能提升了68.90%，并在BLEU和CodeBLEU分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSL框架有效解决了功能等价问题，性能接近或超越当前最优方法，为序列到并行代码翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL
significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to
Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester
performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while
achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is

Result: 顶尖模型在中等难度问题上的通过率为53%，困难问题为0%，且依赖工具而非推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码生成中表现优异，但在复杂推理方面仍有显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

### [363] [Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559)
*Gábor Antal,Dénes Bán,Martin Isztin,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GPT-4在自动生成单元测试方面的能力，重点关注其在漏洞修复中的表现。结果表明，GPT-4能生成语法正确的测试用例，但语义正确性验证有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件测试在质量保障中至关重要，但手动生成测试用例复杂且耗时。研究旨在利用GPT-4自动生成漏洞相关的单元测试，以减轻开发负担。

Method: 使用VUL4J数据集中的漏洞及其修复代码，评估GPT-4生成测试用例的能力，分析代码上下文、自我纠正能力及测试用例的实用性。

Result: GPT-4能生成66.5%语法正确的测试用例，但仅7.5%的语义正确性可自动验证。主观评估显示其生成的测试模板可进一步开发为功能完整的测试。

Conclusion: GPT-4在漏洞测试生成中具有潜力，虽不完全自主，但可作为部分自动化流程的重要工具。

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

*Gábor Antal,Bence Bogenfürst,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GPT-4o在修复Java漏洞时表现比GPT-4差11.9%，但能修复更多独特漏洞。CVE信息和手动提取的代码上下文结合效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o在自动化漏洞修复中的表现，并研究不同上下文信息对修复能力的影响。

Method: 比较GPT-4o与GPT-4在相同提示下的表现，测试9种不同提示（含CWE/CVE信息等），每种提示执行3次，共42个漏洞。

Result: GPT-4o修复了62%的漏洞，优于基线（40%）和复现结果（45%）。CVE信息显著提升修复率。

Conclusion: 集成多种提示策略可提升零样本设置下的漏洞修复效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题日益普遍，需要开发非侵入性诊断工具。EEG信号虽能直接反映神经活动，但其非平稳性和高维度特性带来建模挑战。

Method: Brain2Vec采用混合架构，包括卷积层捕捉空间依赖、LSTM层建模时间序列、注意力机制突出关键时间区域。预处理包括带通滤波、z-score归一化和分段。

Result: 在DEAP数据集上，Brain2Vec的AUC得分为0.68，验证准确率为81.25%，优于传统CNN-LSTM基线。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec有望集成到可穿戴压力监测平台和个性化医疗系统中。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卡尔曼滤波的递归神经网络Recursive KalmanNet，用于在非高斯噪声条件下进行状态估计，并优于传统卡尔曼滤波和现有深度学习估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的动态系统常偏离线性高斯假设，传统卡尔曼滤波效果受限，需要数据驱动的滤波技术。

Method: 采用递归Joseph公式传播误差协方差，优化高斯负对数似然，设计KalmanNet。

Result: 在非高斯测量白噪声实验中，模型优于传统卡尔曼滤波和现有深度学习估计器。

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet在非理想条件下提供准确的状态估计和误差协方差量化。

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的ECG噪声量化方法，通过重建异常检测解决标注不一致和传统方法泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号常受噪声干扰，影响临床和可穿戴设备中的诊断准确性。传统方法存在标注不一致和泛化性不足的问题。

Method: 使用Wasserstein-1距离（$W_1$）比较干净和噪声ECG的重建误差分布，仅需三步反向扩散实现噪声量化。

Result: 模型在基准测试中宏平均$W_1$得分为1.308，优于次优方法48%以上，外部验证显示强泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了临床决策、诊断准确性和实时ECG监测能力，支持未来临床和可穿戴ECG应用的发展。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Motivation: 解决无约束优化问题时，传统方法通常依赖问题相关的先验知识（如Lipschitz常数或噪声边界），限制了其实际应用。本文旨在提出一种无需这些先验知识的实用方法，并在更弱的条件下（如重尾噪声和弱平均平滑）提供理论保证。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在无需先验知识的条件下，解决了无约束优化问题，并在理论和实验上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量子学习和估计方法，用于提升配电网（DNs）与能源社区（ECs）之间的协调效率，解决了信息有限和计算负担高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配电网与能源社区之间的协调面临信息有限（仅能获取能源社区的聚合能源使用数据）和计算负担高（需处理大量不确定性场景）的挑战。

Method: 开发了一种混合量子时间卷积网络-长短期记忆（Q-TCN-LSTM）模型，利用量子叠加和纠缠特性建立ECs响应与DNs价格激励的端到端映射；并提出基于量子振幅估计（QAE）和两个相位旋转电路的量子估计方法，加速不确定性场景下的优化过程。

Conclusion: 量子学习和估计方法显著提升了配电网与能源社区之间的协调效率和计算性能，为解决能源系统中的信息与计算挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的随机优化算法，利用“动量”项，将SHB和SNAG算法作为特例，并允许动量随时间变化。算法在梯度估计允许偏差和方差无界增长的最一般假设下，适用于零阶方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一现有的随机优化算法（如SHB和SNAG），并在更一般的条件下（如梯度估计偏差和方差无界增长）实现收敛。

Method: 提出了一种统一的随机优化算法，包含动量项，并允许动量随时间变化。梯度估计可以是偏置的，且条件方差可以无界增长。

Result: 提出了一组收敛的充分条件，推广了Robbins-Monro和Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum条件，并分析了现有SHB方法的不可行性。

Conclusion: 统一算法在更一般的条件下有效，适用于零阶方法，并揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

Conclusion: 研究表明Swin Transformer能高效学习大脑时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和未来脑机接口开发提供了可能。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.
