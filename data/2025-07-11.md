### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两步因果实验方法，研究大语言模型（LLMs）中认知偏差的来源，发现预训练对偏差的影响大于微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中认知偏差的来源，区分预训练、微调和训练随机性对偏差的影响。

Method: 采用两步实验：1）多次微调模型以研究训练随机性；2）通过交叉调换指令数据集（cross-tuning）分离偏差来源。

Result: 训练随机性引入一定变异性，但偏差主要由预训练决定；相同预训练模型的偏差模式更相似。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏差需考虑预训练来源，未来可基于此制定评估和缓解偏差的策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社会科学调查中的可靠性，发现其对问题表述和答案结构的扰动敏感，并表现出明显的“近因偏差”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs作为人类受试者替代品在调查中的可靠性及其对已知响应偏差的敏感性。

Method: 测试了9种不同的LLMs，应用11种扰动（问题表述和答案结构），模拟了超过167,000次访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出近因偏差，且对语义变化和组合扰动敏感；较大模型更稳健但仍存在问题。

Conclusion: 提示设计和鲁棒性测试对LLMs生成合成调查数据至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于全面评估合成文本的工具包，支持多维度评估，旨在提升合成文本的可用性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成文本在AI开发中具有潜力，但需要系统评估以确保其效用、公平性、隐私安全和分布一致性。

Method: 提供多维度评估工具，包括下游系统效用、公平性、隐私泄漏风险、分布差异和专家反馈。

Result: 工具包在医疗和法律等高风险领域的数据集上展示了功能和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估指标，SynthTextEval提升了合成文本的可行性，促进了AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对医疗领域大语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估协议，填补了现有文献的空白，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是对患者和临床医生的潜在影响。现有评估多关注通用领域，缺乏针对医疗场景的专门评估。

Method: 设计了针对患者和临床医生视角的安全评估协议，构建了包含466个样本的PatientSafetyBench，并在MediPhi模型上进行了案例研究。

Result: 提出了首个针对医疗LLMs的安全性评估标准，为医疗领域的模型部署提供了安全基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗LLMs的安全性评估提供了新方法，有助于其在医疗领域的更安全应用。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了协作学习中打断行为的重要性，提出了一种在多组对话环境中识别打断的先进方法，适用于嘈杂的课堂环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习中的打断行为对知识构建至关重要，但现有研究多在单一对话环境中进行，无法适应多组对话的嘈杂环境。

Method: 分析了单一对话和多组对话环境中的打断检测，开发了一种对重叠语音鲁棒的打断识别方法。

Result: 提出了一种适用于课堂环境的打断识别方法，并揭示了打断行为的语言和韵律特征。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在多组对话环境中跟踪打断行为提供了基础，强调了重叠语音的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康错误信息的反驳言论，结合静态和动态证据，优化了生成内容的相关性、礼貌性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究在生成反驳错误信息的言论时依赖有限证据且缺乏对输出的控制，亟需改进。

Method: 采用多代理检索增强框架，结合多个LLM优化知识检索、证据增强和响应细化，整合静态和动态证据。

Result: 方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线，并通过消融研究和人类评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量反驳言论，且细化过程显著提升质量并获得人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543)
*Chen Amiraz,Yaroslav Fyodorov,Elad Haramaty,Zohar Karnin,Liane Lewin-Eytan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究跨语言检索增强生成（RAG）在特定领域中的表现，发现检索是主要瓶颈，并提出改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言RAG研究多基于开放领域数据（如维基百科），忽略了检索挑战。本研究旨在填补这一空白，专注于阿拉伯语-英语的特定领域场景。

Method: 使用真实企业数据集构建基准，涵盖查询与文档的所有语言组合。提出一种简单检索策略，强制均衡跨语言检索。

Result: 发现检索是跨语言场景的主要瓶颈，性能显著下降。改进策略显著提升了跨语言和整体性能。

Conclusion: 跨语言检索在特定领域应用中存在挑战，改进策略为实际RAG应用提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

### [8] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，用于高效处理长文本，解决了Transformer在长文本处理中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长文本时因二次计算复杂度效率低下，需要更高效的模型。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，利用实时端到端图生成机制处理字符级输入，无需填充或截断，并整合LLM信息。

Result: 模型在文本分类任务中表现出高效性和竞争力，生成的图具有语义组织特征。

Conclusion: 新模型在效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于长文本处理。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

### [9] [Rethinking the Privacy of Text Embeddings: A Reproducibility Study of "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07700)
*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文验证了Vec2Text方法能从文本嵌入中重构原始文本，并探讨了其隐私风险及防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为传输文本嵌入而非原始文本是隐私保护的，但Vec2Text方法挑战了这一假设，因此需要进一步验证其效果和隐私风险。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架，验证其原始声明，并通过参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重构实验及嵌入量化防御研究扩展研究。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效重构文本，甚至密码类序列，但对输入序列长度敏感；高斯噪声和量化技术可缓解隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用文本嵌入，并进一步研究NLP系统的鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Won Seok Jang,Sharmin Sultana,Allen Chang,Yuan Zhang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl是一个可读性控制的指令调整框架，帮助LLMs在不损失意义的情况下调整输出复杂度，显著优于GPT-4，并在临床任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域中人机沟通的挑战，确保内容既个性化又易于理解。

Method: 引入MedReadCtrl框架，通过指令调整控制LLMs输出的可读性。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中表现优于GPT-4，专家更偏好MedReadCtrl，尤其在低识字水平人群中。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl为患者教育和AI医疗的公平访问提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

TL;DR: DTECT是一个端到端的动态主题建模系统，整合了数据预处理、模型架构、评估指标和用户友好功能，如自动主题标注和交互式可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有动态主题建模技术缺乏统一工作流和用户友好探索的问题。

Method: 开发DTECT系统，支持数据预处理、多模型架构、评估指标，并引入LLM驱动的自动主题标注、趋势分析和交互式可视化。

Result: DTECT显著提升了主题建模的易用性和可解释性，支持用户更有效地追踪和理解主题动态。

Conclusion: DTECT通过整合多种功能，为动态主题建模提供了一个高效、易用的解决方案，并已开源。

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end
system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal
insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at
https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/DTECT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction是一个结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化的可扩展管道，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公共驱逐相关SDoH数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的社会决定因素（SDoH）之一，但研究不足，且电子健康记录（EHRs）中缺乏结构化数据。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）构建管道，生成14类细粒度数据集。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在驱逐和其他SDoH分类上表现优于GPT-4o和BioBERT，同时降低了80%的标注成本。

Conclusion: 该管道高效、可扩展，适用于其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是开发小型、可解释的模型，能够用自然语言解释时间序列模式。

Method: 使用合成数据集生成自然语言注释，并用这些注释监督小型Qwen模型的微调。

Result: 微调后的模型获得了有意义的解释能力，并能压缩时间序列理解到轻量级模型中。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发小型、可解释的时间序列模型提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SAND框架，通过自我教学的动作审议提升LLM代理的性能，避免对次优动作的过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理调优方法可能因动作空间探索不足而过度依赖看似合理但次优的动作。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作批判，实现动作审议。

Result: 在两个交互代理任务中，SAND比初始监督微调平均提升20%，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAND通过动作审议显著提升LLM代理性能，为代理调优提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量轨迹，实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at

### [16] [Machine Bullshit: Characterizing the Emergent Disregard for Truth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07484)
*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出‘机器废话’作为大型语言模型（LLM）中真实性缺失的框架，并引入‘废话指数’和分类法，通过实验验证RLHF和CoT提示对废话的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM中真实性缺失的广泛现象，揭示其机制。

Method: 提出废话指数和分类法，在多个数据集上评估LLM的废话行为。

Result: RLHF显著加剧废话，CoT提示放大特定废话形式，政治语境中废话普遍。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供新见解。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING是一种后训练框架，通过从大型语言模型提取任务分解（规划轨迹）并微调小型模型，显著提升了复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用任务分解提升小型开源语言模型的性能，填补了后训练中规划结构应用的空白。

Method: 从大型语言模型提取规划轨迹，并通过监督和强化学习目标微调小型模型。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准测试中平均提升7%，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是提升小型语言模型任务特定性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出TeaR方法，通过数据筛选和强化学习提升LLM的推理能力，实验显示显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，但现有方法因依赖复杂代码结构导致过拟合。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，优化推理路径。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%，R1-Distilled-7B提升5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升LLM推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORR催化剂对提升燃料电池效率至关重要，但从复杂多样的文献中提取结构化信息具有挑战性。

Method: 使用DyGIE++结合MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT等预训练模型，进行数据标注、整合和模型微调。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1-score达82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中F1-score为66.10%，领域特定模型优于通用模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取中表现优异，具有可扩展和自动化文献分析的潜力。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在AI中的广泛应用，研究其能力边界（如幻觉问题）和代理任务的实际可行性变得重要。

Result: LLMs无法完成或验证超出特定复杂度的计算和代理任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的局限性，对实际应用中的任务设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用有限真实数据和专家知识微调大语言模型的框架，构建了中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD），并开发了综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS），在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心理支持需求增加，但非英语语言相关数据集稀缺，需要构建高质量的心理支持对话数据集和系统。

Method: 通过Dialog Generator生成大规模心理对话，Dialog Modifier优化对话质量，构建CPsDD数据集，并开发CADSS系统，包含Profiler、Summarizer、Planner和Supporter模块。

Result: 构建了包含68K对话的CPsDD数据集，CADSS在Strategy Prediction和ESC任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和系统有效解决了心理支持数据稀缺问题，并在实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 传统研究多关注二元对话，本研究旨在探索三方对话中的轮换预测。

Method: 利用声学数据训练多个VAP模型，应用于日本三方对话数据集。

Result: 三方对话训练的VAP模型在所有模型中表现最佳，但对话类型影响准确性。

Conclusion: VAP可用于三方对话轮换预测，未来将整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在少样本提示下的表现，尤其是在嘈杂或低质量数据环境中，是否能够超越传统微调的小型语言模型（SLMs）。

Method: 使用精心设计的少样本提示，结合辩论式LLMs和多种示例选择策略，进行多语言主观性检测。

Result: 在CheckThat! 2025任务中，系统在阿拉伯语和波兰语中排名第一，并在意大利语、英语、德语和多语言赛道中进入前四。

Conclusion: LLM-based少样本学习在多语言情感任务中表现出高效性和适应性，尤其在标注数据稀缺或不一致时，是传统微调的有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL在VLM中的联合效果，以提升复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过多模态推理基准测试，分析SFT和RL的独立作用及结合策略。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题性能但引入冗余，RL促进泛化但效果有限；结合策略未能实现协同。

Conclusion: 需开发更自适应的方法以实现SFT和RL的协同效应。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIMT面临训练数据有限和视觉与文本信息复杂交互的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来提升翻译质量。

Method: M4Doc通过将仅图像编码器与预训练的多模态MLLM对齐，学习视觉-文本关联，并在推理时绕过MLLM以保持效率。

Result: 实验表明，M4Doc在翻译质量、跨领域泛化和复杂文档图像场景中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: M4Doc通过单模态到多模态对齐，有效解决了DIMT的挑战，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Motivation: 揭示离散扩散语言模型的贝叶斯核心，并利用这一洞察提升模型性能。

Method: 通过蒙特卡罗边缘化K次独立噪声样本，收敛到后验分布；提出推理时集成方法，平均K次掩码-去噪过程。

Result: 在WikiText-2上，测试困惑度为8.8（K=8），优于GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练成本即可获得后验感知的token概率和不确定性估计，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: LLMs计算需求高，难以在资源受限环境中部署，研究通过知识蒸馏压缩模型。

Method: 使用Pythia和Qwen2.5模型家族，在SQuAD和MLQA基准上评估零样本和单样本提示下的知识蒸馏效果。

Result: 学生模型参数减少57.1%，性能保留90%以上；单样本提示优于零样本。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可在资源受限应用中实现高效且高性能的QA系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，强调检索效率的重要性，并证明无需大规模微调即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂问题时，现有方法过于关注准确性而忽略了检索效率，本文旨在平衡两者。

Method: 通过改进提示的标准ReAct流程，结合少量监督和RL微调，优化检索次数。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且检索成本减半。

Conclusion: 无需大规模微调即可提升RAG性能，同时显著降低检索成本。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Motivation: 语音伪装替换（PCR）是中文内容审核中的主要障碍，现有方法依赖规则生成的合成数据，忽略了真实用户的创造力。

Method: 提出PCR的四类分类法，构建真实数据集RedNote，测试现有LLM模型，并探索拼音提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差，但拼音提示策略显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类中文PCR，揭示了当前检测器的局限性，并提出轻量级改进方法。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 传统摘要质量评估依赖耗时的人工参考摘要，NOIR旨在提供自动化评估工具，减少对人工的依赖。

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，结合摘要长度压缩，量化摘要质量。

Result: 实验表明NOIR能有效捕捉摘要算法的语义保留与长度压缩权衡，并与人类感知的摘要质量相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为摘要任务提供自动化评估工具，适用于改进摘要算法、提示和合成摘要。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为模拟注意力分数（SAS）的方法，通过低维投影模拟更多注意力头和隐藏特征维度，以提升性能而不增加参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到多头注意力（MHA）性能随注意力头数量增加而提升，但需保持每头隐藏尺寸足够大。因此，提出在最小参数开销下增加头和隐藏尺寸以提升性能。

Method: 引入SAS方法，通过低维投影模拟更多头和隐藏特征维度，并结合参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）控制参数量。

Result: 在多种数据集和任务上验证了SAS的有效性，显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法在保持模型紧凑的同时，显著提升了性能，为注意力机制设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

TL;DR: K2RAG是一种新型框架，通过结合密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要，显著提升了检索质量和效率，同时减少了训练时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统微调LLMs的资源密集型问题以及朴素RAG在可扩展性和答案准确性上的局限性。

Method: 结合密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要，引入预处理步骤以减少训练时间。

Result: K2RAG在MultiHopRAG数据集上表现优异，答案相似度得分最高达0.57，Q3相似度为0.82，训练时间减少93%，执行速度提升40%，VRAM需求减少三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG为LLMs的知识扩展提供了一种高效、可扩展且准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的后训练对齐中，并非所有标记对模型性能贡献均等，因此需要一种更高效的策略。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异，优先处理高影响力标记，并通过实验验证参考模型质量的影响。

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，Selective-DPO方法优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对提升大型语言模型的偏好对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在系统化LLMs在法律领域的研究进展，解决传统方法的局限性，并为未来的法律人工智能发展提供技术路线图和概念框架。

Conclusion: 本文为研究人员提供了技术路线图，为从业者提供了概念框架，奠定了法律人工智能新时代的坚实基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Motivation: 现有流式语音翻译方法依赖句子级语音分段，限制了上下文信息利用和策略学习，StreamUni旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型和多阶段输出解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了流式语音翻译的效果。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以实现从连续表示到具体逻辑公式的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识整合到数据驱动的学习算法中，需要语义一致的连续表示，并且这些表示必须可逆以生成具体需求。

Method: 通过训练一个仅解码器的Transformer模型，反转STL公式的语义嵌入，并利用STL语法构建小词汇表。

Result: 模型在1个epoch后即可生成有效公式，10个epoch后能泛化到逻辑语义，并能生成更简单但语义接近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在需求挖掘任务中有效，可直接在语义空间中进行优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT)的方法，通过差异加权提示和响应标记来优化指令微调的损失函数，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令微调中，损失函数仅计算响应标记而忽略提示标记，这可能不是最优的。论文旨在探索差异加权对性能的影响。

Method: 提出WIT方法，系统研究提示和响应标记的权重分配，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，传统方法性能次优且对输入变化鲁棒性有限，而WIT在多种模型和数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: WIT为指令微调提供了更优的损失函数设计，增强了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Motivation: 扩展单字分词方法，利用平行数据中的源语言标记优化目标语言分词，以增强跨语言语义对齐。

Method: 在固定源分词器的基础上，学习目标分词器，最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 机器翻译质量无提升，但语言建模困惑度降低。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次方扩展可能成为数据效率瓶颈，需探索其他参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Result: 共指消解提升检索效果；均值池化在共指消解后表现最佳；小模型从消解过程中获益更多。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RAG中核心指复杂性的挑战，为提升知识密集型AI应用的检索和生成提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅理论严谨，还具有实际应用价值，能够通过语义病毒概念在AI嵌入空间中传播固定点模式。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式健康代理（CHAs）缺乏自适应多轮推理和透明决策能力，限制了其在临床诊断中的实际应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分解为症状提取、病史获取和因果图构建三个阶段，每个阶段使用可解释的置信度分数指导自适应提问。

Result: 在真实数据集上，DocCHA比基于提示的LLM基线（如GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、LLaMA-3）诊断准确率提升5.18%，症状召回率提升30%。

Conclusion: DocCHA为多语言和资源受限环境中的可信赖LLM临床助手提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中LLM的广泛应用提供了基础，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）提升工业异常检测和推理能力，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。


<details>

Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，缺乏可解释性和泛化能力，SAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAGE结合SFE和E-DPO，利用AD-PL数据集进行训练，并通过MLE框架评估模型逻辑和一致性。

Result: SAGE在零样本和单样本设置下在工业异常数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案，并开源了代码、模型和数据集。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

TL;DR: MIRIX是一种模块化、多代理的记忆系统，通过六种结构化记忆类型和多代理框架，解决了AI记忆的关键挑战，显著提升了多模态和长对话任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI记忆解决方案功能有限，无法个性化、抽象化或可靠地长期存储用户信息，MIRIX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MIRIX包含六种记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库），结合多代理框架动态管理记忆更新与检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA多模态任务中，MIRIX比基线准确率提升35%，存储需求减少99.9%；在LOCOMO长对话任务中达到85.4%的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型语言模型代理设定了新标准，并通过实际应用展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）比显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差，主要原因是IM-RM更依赖表层的词级线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）在泛化能力上的差异，揭示其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM与EX-RM的差异，验证IM-RM对词级线索的依赖。

Result: IM-RM在词级分布变化和分布内任务中泛化能力较差，且不受任务难度影响。

Conclusion: 奖励模型的设计选择对其泛化行为有显著影响，IM-RM的局限性源于对词级线索的依赖。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 探索如何在资源有限的医疗环境中利用语言模型支持临床决策，尤其是风湿病学领域。

Method: 使用小语言模型（SLMs）结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，并与大语言模型（LLMs）进行对比评估。

Result: SLMs + RAG 在诊断和治疗性能上优于LLMs，且能耗更低，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: SLMs + RAG 是资源有限医疗环境中的可行方案，但仍需专家监督以确保准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在医学推理能力评估上存在不足，缺乏严格基准，因此需要透明且可信的评估工具。

Method: 提出MedThink-Bench基准和LLM-w-Ref框架，利用专家标注的逐步推理和LLM-as-a-Judge机制进行评估。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关，且较小模型（如MedGemma-27B）表现优于大型专有模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为LLMs医学推理评估提供了基础工具，推动其在临床实践中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: PyVision是一个交互式框架，使MLLMs能自主生成、执行和优化基于Python的工具，提升视觉推理任务的灵活性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法受限于预定义工作流和静态工具集，限制了灵活性和适应性。

Method: 开发PyVision框架，支持多轮交互和动态生成Python工具，并通过分类法分析工具使用情况。

Result: PyVision显著提升性能，如GPT-4.1在V*上提升7.8%，Claude-4.0-Sonnet在VLMsAreBlind-mini上提升31.1%。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型不仅能使用工具，还能创造工具，推动更具自主性的视觉推理。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

TL;DR: 前沿大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务上表现优异，但在简单推理任务上频繁失败。研究通过生成简单任务集和“unpuzzles”数据集，揭示了模型在统计捷径、中间步骤错误和长上下文处理上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索前沿LLMs在简单推理任务上的表现，揭示其失败原因，以理解模型的泛化能力。

Method: 扩展文献中的工作，生成可调参数的简单任务集（如计数、一阶逻辑等），并引入“unpuzzles”数据集。

Result: 前沿LLMs在简单任务上表现不佳，失败模式与统计捷径、中间步骤错误和长上下文处理相关。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在简单任务上的泛化能力仍存在问题，任务简化未必提升性能。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合符号推理与自适应控制的统一代理框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）实现故障恢复规划和连续过程控制，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化学过程日益复杂，劳动力短缺和故障场景多样化，需要新的自动化范式来结合符号推理与自适应控制。

Method: 采用有限状态机（FSMs）作为可解释的操作框架，通过LLM驱动的规划代理提出恢复序列，模拟代理执行和检查每个转换，验证-重新提示循环迭代优化无效计划。

Result: 在案例研究1中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在180个随机生成的FSMs中实现了100%的有效路径成功率；在案例研究2中，LLM控制器在非线性动态处理中表现优于经典PID控制。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs可以统一高级符号规划和低级连续控制，为化学工程中的语言驱动自动化铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在艺术分类中存在偏见，主要源于数据集中某些艺术风格的过度代表，导致模型对罕见风格的分类准确性下降。现有研究忽视了这一偏见问题，尤其是在处理分布外数据时。

Method: 提出BOOST方法，通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，平衡各类别的表示，并引入新指标SODC评估类别分离和偏见减少。

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上，BOOST方法在保持高性能的同时显著减少了类别偏见。

Conclusion: BOOST方法为艺术领域的AI模型提供了一种有效的去偏见解决方案，平衡了性能与公平性。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with

Result: 系统评估了人工与机器分类在识别供应链强迫劳动新闻文章中的差异。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法和问题树LLM查询能有效在稀疏数据中检测非法活动，为供应链分析提供新思路。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Conclusion: ViDove在多模态翻译中表现优异，并发布了新基准DoveBench。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

Method: 通过分析输入提示和输出内容的过滤效率，证明在加密假设下，高效过滤器无法区分恶意与良性提示，且输出过滤在特定情况下计算不可行。

Result: 发现输入和输出过滤均存在计算障碍，外部过滤器无法确保LLMs的安全性。

Conclusion: 安全需依赖LLM内部设计，而非外部过滤器；智能与判断不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec满足通用性、动态性、数据整合和反馈紧密的需求，有效优化供应链运输策略。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely

TL;DR: 提出DrugMCTS框架，结合RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，用于药物重定位，无需领域微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在科学领域（如药物发现）中推理能力受限的问题，克服传统方法的高计算开销或数据利用不足的局限性。

Method: 整合RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过五个专业智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，实现结构化迭代推理。

Result: 在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上，DrugMCTS性能显著优于通用LLM和深度学习基线，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct表现提升超20%。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对推进LLM在药物发现中的应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo是一个基于《星露谷物语》的新基准测试，用于评估AI代理在开放式生产生活模拟中的表现，涵盖农业、手工艺、探索、战斗和社交互动五大领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少同时评估生产活动和社会互动能力，StarDojo旨在填补这一空白。

Method: StarDojo包含1,000个任务和100个代表性子集，提供统一接口支持多环境并行执行，适用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）代理的评估。

Result: 当前最先进的MLLMs代理表现有限，最佳模型GPT-4.1成功率仅为12.7%，主要因视觉理解、多模态推理和低级操作挑战。

Conclusion: StarDojo旨在促进复杂生产生活环境中稳健开放式代理的研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Result: 案例研究表明了候选算法的形成和验证方法，为理解LLM的内部计算提供了系统评估。

Conclusion: 算法解释为人类可理解的解释性提供路径，可能推动更高效的训练方法和新型架构设计。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Result: 研究发现，常用的规则型模型学习工具会导致规则集出现负面特征。

Conclusion: 论文强调了对规则型模型负面特征进行分析的重要性，并指出了现有工具的局限性。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Motivation: 现有GNN模型在知识图谱链接预测中表现平平，缺乏针对查询的图生成方法，尤其是在归纳设置中。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上应用于两个SOTA模型，42/48的测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling显著提升了GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的表现，尤其在归纳设置中具有创新性。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为链状信用网络及更广泛网络提供了实用见解，但需进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief
and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust
uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在几何和空间推理方面存在不足，尤其是在模拟物理约束、保持空间一致性及布局扰动下的泛化能力上。PlanQA旨在填补这一空白，推动更准确的空间推理模型发展。

Method: PlanQA基于符号化格式（如JSON、XML）的室内场景结构化表示，设计多样化问题类型，测试度量、拓扑推理及室内设计约束。

Result: 实验表明，尽管LLMs在简单查询上表现良好，但在物理约束模拟、空间一致性保持及布局扰动泛化上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了LLMs在真实世界布局推理上的盲点，为未来开发更准确的空间推理语言模型提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理和摘要任务中优于标准DPO，能更稳定地优化模型对齐。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，有望实现更可靠和可解释的语言模型对齐。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Conclusion: 几何特征可用于小提琴分类，但需考虑存在不同程度的缩小，未来可进一步优化方法。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

Result: 最高分模型得72/100，但在信仰与灵性、品格与美德等维度表现不足。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark为开发支持人类繁荣的AI提供了框架，对AI伦理和评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向设计和逐步推理，显著提升性能并降低计算成本，为自适应驾驶提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Method: 提出自适应感知方法，动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置），以减少协变量偏移并提高效率。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁将自适应感知整合到实际应用中，并提出研究方向（如标准化基准、实时算法、隐私保护方法），以推动可持续、鲁棒和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial

TL;DR: 论文认为，随着计算资源投入的边际效益递减，AI模型性能将趋于收敛，即使是资源有限的小模型也能接近最佳模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型性能不平等问题，提出计算资源边际效益递减将导致性能收敛的观点。

Method: 开发模型分析固定分布下计算资源投入的边际效益，结合基准数据和理论模型验证。

Result: 计算资源投入的边际效益显著下降，小模型性能将接近最佳模型。

Conclusion: AI战略和政策需重新审视，以适应小模型性能提升的趋势。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Motivation: 理解生成式AI对经济的广泛影响是社会的关键问题。

Method: 分析20万条用户与Microsoft Bing Copilot的匿名对话数据，结合职业活动分类和任务成功度量。

Result: AI最常用于信息提供、写作等活动，知识型职业（如计算机、行政支持）的AI适用性得分最高。

Conclusion: AI对知识型职业影响显著，实际应用与预测相符，工资和教育水平与AI适用性相关。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

### [78] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的电影推荐框架，通过结合用户文本偏好和传统推荐算法（如SVD/SVD++），显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐算法无法直接利用用户提供的文本偏好（如“喜欢轻松幽默的喜剧”）进行个性化推荐，而LLM在自然语言处理方面表现出色，为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 使用SVD或SVD++生成初始推荐，再通过LLM整合用户文本偏好进行优化。实验采用MovieLens数据集，通过留一验证和分层测试评估性能。

Result: LLM增强的框架在各项指标上显著优于传统算法（如累积命中率提升约6倍，NDCG提升约3.7倍），但计算开销略有增加。

Conclusion: LLM与推荐系统的结合能有效提升个性化推荐效果，未来可进一步优化计算效率。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GCL在推荐系统中的潜在安全风险，特别是其对目标推广攻击的敏感性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，提出攻击方法CLeaR和防御框架SIM。

Result: GCL模型对CLeaR攻击更敏感，而SIM能有效缓解这种漏洞。

Conclusion: 需关注GCL的安全性，SIM为防御目标推广攻击提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated substantial promise in
enhancing the robustness and generalization of recommender systems,
particularly by enabling models to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for
improved representation learning. However, in this paper, we reveal an
unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the
susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both
theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause
as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which
disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally
enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce
CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies
spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility
of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further
propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to
accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model
performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation
models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM
effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图对比学习方法因数据增强引入噪声和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 利用GNN中节点与其邻居层的自然对比视图，避免数据增强，减少噪声和存储成本。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，NLGCL在效果和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NLGCL提供了一种高效且语义相关的图对比学习框架，适用于实际推荐系统。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in collaborative filtering to
capture high-order user-item relationships. To address the data sparsity
problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged
as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive
views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that
introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and
storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning
framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers
within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as
positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based
noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view
construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for
real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的IPS方法（IPSsim），通过考虑文档相似性来更有效地减轻位置偏差对学习排序模型的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户点击数据存在位置偏差，传统IPS方法未能充分利用低排名文档与高排名相关文档的相似性。

Method: 提出IPSsim方法，结合文档相似性重新加权点击数据，以更准确地估计文档的相关性。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，IPSsim在n≥30时显著优于传统IPS方法，例如在n=50时NDCG提升约3%。

Conclusion: IPSsim能更有效地减轻位置偏差，提升学习排序模型的性能。

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) models learn from historical user interactions, such
as user clicks. However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due
to position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents
than low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many
approaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse
Propensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to
the position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was
clicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In
this paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to
highly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,
accounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant
documents when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of
position bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that
takes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We
evaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets
under a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of
training clicks. Our experiments show that our IPSsim estimator is more
effective than the existing IPS estimators for learning an unbiased LTR model,
particularly in top-n settings when n >= 30. For example, when n = 50, our
IPSsim estimator achieves a statistically significant ~3% improvement (p <
0.05) in terms of NDCG compared to the Doubly Robust estimator from the
literature.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了信息检索（IR）评估中判别力的重要性，提出通过量化Type II错误和使用平衡分类指标来更全面地评估相关性标注（qrels）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR评估依赖昂贵的人工标注相关性数据（qrels），而更高效的方法需要验证其判别力。现有研究仅关注Type I错误，忽略了Type II错误对科学结论的影响。

Method: 通过实验比较不同相关性标注方法生成的qrels，量化Type II错误，并引入平衡分类指标（如平衡准确率）来综合评估判别力。

Result: 研究发现，量化Type II错误能提供更深入的判别力洞察，平衡分类指标可简化为单一可比较的数值。

Conclusion: 论文强调同时关注Type I和Type II错误的重要性，并提出平衡分类指标作为评估qrels判别力的有效工具。

Abstract: The evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems typically uses
query-document pairs with corresponding human-labelled relevance assessments
(qrels). These qrels are used to determine if one system is better than another
based on average retrieval performance. Acquiring large volumes of human
relevance assessments is expensive. Therefore, more efficient relevance
assessment approaches have been proposed, necessitating comparisons between
qrels to ascertain their efficacy. Discriminative power, i.e. the ability to
correctly identify significant differences between systems, is important for
drawing accurate conclusions on the robustness of qrels. Previous work has
measured the proportion of pairs of systems that are identified as
significantly different and has quantified Type I statistical errors. Type I
errors lead to incorrect conclusions due to false positive significance tests.
We argue that also identifying Type II errors (false negatives) is important as
they lead science in the wrong direction. We quantify Type II errors and
propose that balanced classification metrics, such as balanced accuracy, can be
used to portray the discriminative power of qrels. We perform experiments using
qrels generated using alternative relevance assessment methods to investigate
measuring hypothesis testing errors in IR evaluation. We find that additional
insights into the discriminative power of qrels can be gained by quantifying
Type II errors, and that balanced classification metrics can be used to give an
overall summary of discriminative power in one, easily comparable, number.

Motivation: 传统的大型语言模型训练方式资源密集且缺乏灵活性，本文探索了一种更灵活、高效的替代方法。

Result: 合并后的专家模型性能提升，逐层训练方法稳定且深度与复杂推理能力相关。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源高效扩展和模块化AI开发提供了新范式。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Result: FashionBLIP-2在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ基准测试中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型为时尚领域的图像检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘（MU）是一种成本效益高的方法，用于从扩散模型中清除不需要的信息，但验证信息是否完全移除及其对模型性能的影响具有挑战性。

Method: 利用（视觉）语言模型提取结构化知识，识别可能因遗忘而受损的邻近概念，并通过对抗性提示绕过遗忘。

Result: 语言模型能够对邻近概念进行语义排序，与遗忘损害相关，并能通过合成对抗性提示有效绕过遗忘。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为评估扩散模型遗忘效果提供了自动化工具，揭示了语言模型在语义排序和对抗性提示中的有效性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链接特定的结构模式，且现有注入结构上下文的方法计算成本高或过于简化。

Method: SP4LP先通过GNN计算节点表示，再提取候选节点对的最短路径并用序列模型处理，以捕捉多跳关系模式。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最优性能，理论证明其表达能力优于标准GNN和其他结构特征方法。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一种高效且理论支持的方法，适用于图的链接预测任务。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

Conclusion: Str-GCL为图表示学习中利用结构常识提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

TL;DR: CCQ是一种针对大语言模型（LLM）的低比特量化方法，通过卷积码和混合编码技术，将模型压缩至2.0-2.75比特，同时保持高精度和高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的扩大，推理成本急剧上升，部署难度增加。现有量化方法在低于3比特时面临精度和效率的严重下降。

Method: CCQ结合硬件感知的位移编码与解码、卷积码、混合编码和代码聚类，构建无查找表的编码空间，实现权重向量的线性映射，优化推理性能。

Result: 实验表明，CCQ在多个基准测试中表现出色，成功将DeepSeek-V3和ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B压缩至184GB和89GB，支持单GPU部署。

Conclusion: CCQ在极低比特条件下显著降低模型部署成本，同时保持高精度，为LLM的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

TL;DR: G-Guard是一种基于注意力感知的GNN输入分类器，用于防御LLM的多轮越狱攻击，通过构建实体图和注意力增强机制显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM经过严格训练，但仍易受多轮越狱攻击，传统方法难以检测和缓解此类攻击。

Method: 提出G-Guard，构建多轮查询的实体图，引入注意力感知增强机制，利用相似单轮查询作为标记节点提升分类能力。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效防御多轮越狱攻击，为LLM安全提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Result: 在11个识别数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过描述无关的方式和多提示加权，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在局限性，如刚性源分布和有限采样路径，而流匹配虽具有优势但未充分利用误差信息。

Method: CGFM扩展了流匹配，结合辅助模型输出，构建双面条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在时间序列预测任务中优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过利用误差信息和扩展概率路径，显著提升了预测性能，推动了预测方法的进步。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Result: WSA在多个Atari游戏中表现与端到端模型相当，并研究了模型数量对性能的影响。

Conclusion: WSA为结合预训练模型提供了高效且性能良好的解决方案，扩展了强化学习的可能性。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Conclusion: DeCoLe为解决标签偏差导致的错误标注提供了有效工具，可提升数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Result: 学习的奇异子空间在下游任务（如特征分析和多步预测）中表现可靠且有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在可扩展性和稳定性上优于现有方法，适用于随机动力系统。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE相比单模型和简单集成基线，表现出更好的校准和预测性能。

Conclusion: MUSE通过利用模型多样性，显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Conclusion: 能源感知的基准测试对注意力机制设计至关重要，研究为选择资源高效机制提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在设计安全分布式深度学习系统时，必须考虑中间特征泄露的风险。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Conclusion: ProbNES是一种高效且通用的零阶局部优化算法，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Result: 仿真显示DPVD-MARL比独立Q学习收敛速度快20%，累计奖励提高15%。

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL算法有效提升了CFL的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）的框架，用于生成能够逃避入侵检测系统（IDS）的隐蔽对抗攻击，并通过条件变分自编码器（CVAE）检测这些攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机（UAV）在民用空域的广泛应用，传统异常检测方法难以识别新型威胁，而现有的OOD检测器无法区分隐蔽对抗攻击与真实OOD事件。

Method: 设计了一个基于cGAN的框架，生成对抗样本以欺骗IDS，并使用CVAE通过负对数似然检测这些样本。

Result: CVAE的后悔分数在检测隐蔽对抗攻击方面显著优于传统的基于马氏距离的检测器。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高级概率建模对增强IDS对抗生成模型驱动的网络入侵能力的重要性。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Result: 仿真结果显示，与传统SAC算法相比，收敛速度提升3倍，信息泄露减少13%。

Conclusion: ICM-CA框架有效减少信息泄露并提高训练效率，适用于边缘设备协作训练场景。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Conclusion: 为将通用LLMs转化为可靠的化学研究工具提供了可行框架，并指出了未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Result: 在四个节点分类基准上，准确率提升了3%，同时增强了表示的几何可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过显式的几何感知投影，模型不仅提升了预测能力，还使图表示更具可解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Conclusion: CEBE和CSE为DRL在单一上下文训练中的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Result: 在多种因果推理和发现任务中，GO-CBED表现优于基线方法，尤其在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的情况下。

Conclusion: GO-CBED通过目标导向和前瞻性序列规划，显著提升了实验设计的效率和效果。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Conclusion: 统一框架有效解决了奖励破解问题，提升了模型在分布外场景中的表现。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子动力学模拟中罕见事件（如状态转换）难以直接观测的问题，现有机器学习方法未能完全编码动态细节。

Method: 提出TLC框架，从生成模型的时间滞后条件中学习CVs，捕捉慢动态行为。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide系统中验证，TLC在路径采样和状态区分任务中表现优于或等同于现有MLCV方法。

Conclusion: TLC通过直接建模时间滞后条件，提供了一种更准确的CV学习方法，适用于增强采样任务。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏语义理解、计算成本高且受限于自动定理证明的进展，需要更可靠的评估指标。

Method: GTED框架通过标准化形式化语句并将其转换为操作树，利用GTED度量计算语义相似性。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet基准测试中，GTED在准确性和Kappa分数上优于所有基线指标。

Conclusion: GTED为自动评估提供了更可靠的指标，代码和实验结果已开源。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Motivation: 预训练与微调方法在异构图神经网络中广泛应用，但存在预训练模型与下游任务不匹配的问题，导致性能不佳。提示学习方法为解决这一问题提供了新方向。

Method: 1. 将下游任务统一为图级任务格式；2. 设计图级对比预训练策略；3. 引入异构图特征提示。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，HGMP能适应多种任务，性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HGMP通过统一任务格式和对比预训练策略，有效解决了异构图领域的任务不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Motivation: 探索神经网络如何通过预训练任务（如下一标记预测）自然地学习并表达对数据生成模型的信念。

Method: 通过分析不同输入序列诱导的神经激活几何关系，研究神经网络如何表示历史对未来影响的概率密度。

Result: 神经网络能够发现这些表示，而经典电路无法实现；几何关系与架构无关。

Conclusion: 神经网络通过预训练任务自然地学习并表达对数据生成模型的信念，具有普适性。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Result: 尽管许多应用仍处于原型阶段，但随着对GPMs兴趣的增加，预计未来几年将成熟。

Conclusion: GPMs有望在化学科学中发挥重要作用，加速研究进程。

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中任务目标差异可能导致负迁移，现有方法因固定网络容量和结构限制适应性，动态网络架构效率低下。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，在令牌空间中识别梯度冲突并自适应调整，避免直接转换共享参数为任务特定参数。

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL显著提升多任务性能，计算开销低，且无需过多参数增长。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的多任务学习提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Motivation: 研究BCI分类器的不确定性量化能力，以提高分类的可靠性。

Method: 比较了CSP-LDA、MDRM、深度集成、直接不确定性量化和标准CNN的不确定性量化能力。

Result: CSP-LDA和MDRM-T的不确定性估计最佳，但深度集成和标准CNN的分类准确性更高。所有模型都能区分易难样本。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝模糊样本，可以提高BCI的准确性，CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性量化上表现优异。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Motivation: 解决PVGs未应用于高维图像和CBMs依赖低容量线性预测器的局限性。

Method: 利用概念编码和PVGs，通过非线性预测器进行决策。

Result: NCV在复杂数据集上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG，并减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV是实现高性能、可验证AI的有前景方法。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于多变量时间序列，能够在单次处理中动态学习数据的相关性结构，实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的发展，实时异常检测需求激增，需要处理高维流数据且不存储历史数据，以确保低内存占用和快速决策。

Method: DAD通过在线去相关学习方法，动态监控数据的相关性结构，单次处理样本，避免传统方法的窗口或全数据处理负担。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上，DAD表现出最一致且优异的性能，尤其在高维数据流中表现稳健。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得最佳平衡，为实时、内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Result: 方法在多种挑战性场景下表现稳定，并证明了在数据不足时的收敛性和误差界限。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了低秩近似的数值稳定性，适用于大规模神经网络的压缩与微调。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Result: 在动态信号条件下，性能显著优于3GPP基准至少180%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了CHO的挑战，为现代蜂窝网络提供了更高效的切换方案。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL

Sparse Proximity-based Self-Federated Learning (SParSeFuL), a resource-aware
approach that bridges this gap by combining aggregate computing for
self-organization with neural network sparsification to reduce energy and

TL;DR: SLOGAN提出了一种基于稀疏因果建模和动态干预机制的图域自适应方法，显著提升了无监督图域自适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因因果-虚假特征纠缠和全局对齐策略失效导致性能不佳，需改进。

Method: 通过稀疏因果图结构、互信息瓶颈约束和生成干预机制，分离因果特征并压缩虚假相关性。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，SLOGAN显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过因果特征解耦和动态干预，实现了稳定的图表示迁移。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

TL;DR: TransformEEG是一种结合卷积和Transformer的混合模型，用于基于EEG数据的帕金森病检测，通过深度卷积分词器生成通道特定特征，提高了模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型因受试者间高变异性导致泛化能力差，需开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，采用深度卷积分词器生成通道特定特征，结合自注意力层进行特征混合，并通过N-LNSO交叉验证评估。

Result: TransformEEG在四组公开数据集上表现最佳，平衡准确率中位数达78.45%，结合数据增强后提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG显著降低了变异性，提供了更可靠的帕金森病检测结果。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合联邦分割学习（FSL）和Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构，解决了传统联邦学习的中心化隐私风险和分割学习的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感领域中，需要可扩展且隐私保护的协作机器学习解决方案。传统联邦学习存在单点故障和隐私风险，而分割学习因顺序训练扩展性差。

Method: 采用FSL与HLF结合的去中心化架构，利用HLF的链码协调分割模型执行和点对点聚合，无需中央协调器，并通过HLF的瞬态字段和私有数据集合保护数据隐私。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL达到了与中心化FSL相当的准确性，同时减少了每轮训练时间，性能测试显示区块链开销最小且准确性保持。

Conclusion: 该架构展示了企业级可行性，为敏感领域的协作机器学习提供了隐私保护和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了有限宽度全连接ReLU网络中每层的有效维度（特征矩阵的秩），推导了随机高斯权重下隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并发现秩的几何衰减和振荡现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机ReLU层如何交替压缩和部分恢复输入变化的子空间，为深度网络表达能力提供更细致的理解。

Method: 通过固定输入批次和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并分析秩的几何衰减和振荡行为。

Result: 发现秩以几何比率衰减，并在特定深度出现局部最大值（“复兴”深度），且这种现象在有限宽度下出现。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层在有限宽度下表现出秩的振荡行为，而正交权重初始化或强负斜率leaky-ReLU可保持秩接近满秩。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联邦类增量学习（FCIL）方法FedCBDR，通过全局协调机制和任务感知温度缩放模块解决类不平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦类增量学习中因类不平衡导致的性能限制问题，包括回放缓冲区内和任务间的类不平衡。

Method: 1) 全局视角数据回放模块，隐私保护地重构先前任务的全局表示；2) 任务感知温度缩放模块，自适应调整温度和实例级别的logits。

Result: 在异构数据分布下实现平衡的类采样，任务间不平衡时提升泛化能力，Top-1准确率提升2%-15%。

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过平衡回放和任务感知调整，有效解决了FCIL中的类不平衡问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出GuardVal协议，动态生成和优化越狱提示，评估LLM的安全漏洞，发现不同模型的行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以全面评估LLM的漏洞，需更有效的越狱评估协议。

Method: 引入GuardVal协议，动态生成和优化越狱提示，结合新优化方法防止停滞。

Result: 应用于多种模型（如Mistral-7b、GPT-4），发现不同行为模式，提供全面评估。

Conclusion: GuardVal能更准确评估LLM安全性，为未来研究和模型开发提供参考。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多任务神经网络方法，用于估计随机实验中的分布处理效应（DTE），解决了传统方法在数据不平衡和计算效率上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在估计分布处理效应时存在数据不平衡和计算效率低的问题，需要更高效且精确的解决方案。

Method: 采用多任务神经网络，结合单调形状约束和多阈值标签学习，以提升条件结果分布的估计精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代因果推断应用提供了稳健且实用的解决方案，尤其适用于需要详细理解处理效应异质性的场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法仅调整模型响应，内部表征仍保留被遗忘数据信息，无法满足隐私、法律或伦理需求。

Method: 提出基于特征表示单点收缩的深度遗忘理论准则，并设计高效近似算法OPC。

Result: OPC在图像分类遗忘任务中表现出色，能有效抵御性能恢复和梯度反转攻击。

Conclusion: OPC的理论基础实现了深度特征遗忘，强调了提升机器遗忘方法鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

TL;DR: TRIX是一种特征感知的对抗训练框架，通过自适应分配不同强度的对抗样本，减少类别间鲁棒性差异，提升最差类别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法对所有类别采用统一目标，忽视了类别间脆弱性差异，导致对抗不公平性。强类别鲁棒性提升，弱类别仍易受攻击。

Method: TRIX为强类别分配较弱的目标对抗样本以促进特征多样性，为弱类别分配较强的非目标对抗样本以增强鲁棒性，并结合类别损失加权和扰动强度调整。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，TRIX显著提升了最差类别准确率，减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，并保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是迈向公平有效对抗防御的实用步骤。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Result: S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T通过同步任务关系有效提升了多任务下测试时训练的性能。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Result: 在广泛使用的系统识别基准上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过改善状态空间数据分布，显著提升了训练效果和模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Conclusion: SAMVAE为临床决策提供可解释的数据驱动生存分析基础。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Conclusion: 新方法为理解自注意力块的鲁棒性提供了新视角，JaSMin有效降低了网络的局部Lipschitz常数。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Motivation: 探索预训练AI模型在填补缺失协变量时对决策过程遗憾的影响，并提出统一的理论框架。

Method: 引入“模型弹性”概念，利用正交统计学习和双重稳健回归校准预训练模型。

Result: 在MAR设置下，校准预训练模型显著提高填补协变量质量，改善遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 预训练模型的准确性对序列决策任务具有实际价值，模型弹性可作为评估和改进预训练模型集成的基本指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Motivation: 尽管自然梯度下降在实践中表现出快速收敛，但其理论收敛性难以证明，尤其是在简单情况下（如凹对数似然和高斯近似）。

Method: 采用平方根参数化方法处理高斯协方差，为自然梯度变分高斯推断及其连续时间梯度流建立收敛保证。

Result: 实验证明了自然梯度方法的有效性，并显示其优于欧几里得或Wasserstein几何的算法。

Conclusion: 通过平方根参数化方法，成功解决了自然梯度变分高斯推断的收敛性问题，并验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve

Result: 研究涵盖了DPO的所有变体，并揭示了其通用框架的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: DPO的通用视角有助于理解其运作机制，并为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

TL;DR: ApexOracle是一种AI模型，能预测现有化合物的抗菌效力并设计针对新病原体的分子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗生素耐药性（AMR）日益严重，现有方法无法快速应对新病原体或耐药菌株。

Method: 结合分子特征、基因组和文献数据，通过离散扩散语言模型和双嵌入框架实现预测和分子设计。

Result: 在多种细菌和化学模式中表现优异，能有效迁移至无数据的新病原体。

Conclusion: ApexOracle为应对AMR和未来传染病提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data

critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding

experimental structures in MLSF training. Our study informs future data
augmentation strategies based on co-folding models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMO是一种轻量级的MTL优化方法，通过全局-局部扰动结合SAM，有效缓解任务冲突，提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL中任务冲突限制了模型性能，而SAM能缓解冲突，但如何结合全局和局部信息以及计算效率是挑战。

Method: 提出SAMO方法，利用联合全局-局部扰动，通过前向传递近似局部扰动并进行层归一化。

Result: 在多个多任务基准测试中验证了SAMO的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: SAMO成功解决了MTL中的任务冲突问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常在训练或编译时应用，且依赖结构化稀疏性，未能充分利用无SIMD支持设备的细粒度效率。

Method: UnIT通过输入特定的激活模式动态识别并跳过不必要的乘加操作，将剪枝决策转化为轻量级比较，并优化计算。

Result: 在MSP430微控制器上，UnIT实现了11.02%至82.03%的乘加操作减少，推理速度提升27.30%至84.19%，能耗降低27.33%至84.38%。

Conclusion: UnIT为非结构化推理时剪枝提供了一种可行且实用的解决方案，适用于微控制器上的高效神经网络部署。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

<details>

Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和数据管理的风险。现有技术虽然能重建训练集中的图像，但依赖高资源和精心设计的提示词。本文旨在开发一种更简单、更普遍的攻击方法。

Method: 基于先前工作的直觉，利用领域知识，发现从电商平台抓取的数据存在模板化布局和图像与模式化提示词关联的根本漏洞。

Result: 通过低资源攻击，成功重建了训练集中的图像，例如使用提示词“蓝色Unisex T-Shirt”生成了真实人类模特的照片。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了生成模型在数据重建方面的潜在风险，即使是普通用户也可能无意中触发此类攻击，强调了数据来源和模型设计的重要性。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LMs）近年来取得巨大进展，但预处理步骤（如分词）仍是实现真正端到端基础模型的障碍。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合显式层次网络（H-Net），实现内容与上下文相关的分段策略，完全端到端学习。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的Transformer，多级层次进一步提升了性能和数据效率，尤其在中文、代码和DNA序列等任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了端到端模型在未处理数据上的潜力，显著优于传统分词流程，尤其在弱分词任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习中，如何利用离线数据提升在线学习的样本效率是一个核心挑战。Q-chunking旨在通过动作分块技术解决探索问题。

Method: 将动作分块技术应用于基于时间差分（TD）的强化学习方法，直接在分块动作空间中运行RL，以利用离线数据中的时间一致性行为。

Result: 实验表明，Q-chunking在离线性能和在线样本效率上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking通过动作分块技术有效提升了离线到在线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: EXPO通过稳定模仿学习和动态编辑策略，有效解决了表达性策略在线强化学习中的挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整预训练大语言模型（LLM）层结构的方法（CoLa），通过跳过、重复或重新排列层来优化推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练神经网络是否能在不微调的情况下根据输入动态调整架构，以及是否所有层对简单任务都必要。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）为每个测试样本找到最优的层组合（CoLa），支持跳过、重复或重新排列层。

Result: 对于75%的正确预测样本，可找到更短的CoLa；对于60%的错误预测样本，可找到正确的CoLa。

Conclusion: 固定架构的LLM在推理时存在不足，动态深度适配能显著提升效率和性能。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法为强子态极点结构推断提供了可扩展的工具，适用于其他候选强子态。

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is
limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning
approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is
based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on
predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while
discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on
synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the
$P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole
structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the
presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While
evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to
other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure
inference in scattering amplitudes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变分神经退火（VNA）的方法，用于解决带约束的投资组合优化问题，其性能优于现有优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的投资组合优化问题因约束条件（如交易成本和周转限制）而难以用传统混合整数优化器解决。

Method: 将问题映射到经典Ising-like哈密顿量，并通过自回归神经网络实现VNA求解。

Result: VNA在2000多种资产的投资组合中表现优异，收敛速度快于Mosek等优化器，且展现出多项式退火时间标度。

Conclusion: VNA是一种高效的投资组合优化方法，具有普适性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

Motivation: 扩展和形式化Weitz等人的工作，为现代Ising机和概率计算机提供参数化和快速采样方法。

Method: PAOA通过迭代修改二元随机单元网络的耦合参数，结合独立样本的成本评估，实现高效采样。

Result: 在26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick模型上，PAOA表现优于QAOA，且在SK-Lévy等重尾问题上优于模拟退火。

Conclusion: PAOA通过优化多个温度曲线，自然扩展了模拟退火，并在性能上超越传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和设计最优学习协议提供了理论基础，并为基于统计物理学的元学习理论开辟了路径。

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

Motivation: 随着IoT生态系统的扩展，其成为复杂恶意软件攻击的目标，需要隐私保护且能应对数据异质性的检测框架。现有联邦学习算法在非独立同分布（non-IID）和类别不平衡数据下表现不佳。

Method: FedP3E框架通过高斯混合模型（GMM）构建类原型，添加高斯噪声保护隐私，并通过SMOTE增强少数类样本。服务器聚合原型并分发给客户端，以丰富本地模型。

Result: 在N-BaIoT数据集上验证了FedP3E在数据不平衡场景下的有效性，减少了统计异质性的负面影响。

Conclusion: FedP3E通过原型交换机制，在保护隐私的同时提升了联邦学习在IoT恶意软件检测中的性能。

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

Result: 攻击成功率高达70%，且攻击者预算（token数量）仅需适度增加。

Conclusion: 现有防御措施在白盒设置下无法提供足够安全性，需进一步研究更鲁棒的防御方法。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into
modern cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating
traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding
capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become
increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of
Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective
for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving
attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and
identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric
setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose
gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality
without Robbins-Siegmund theorem nor martingale convergence theory, we recover
results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$
for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot
\max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s)
- F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved
that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a
convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2
\frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and
$\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in

Result: 在四种癌症类型的PET-CT数据集上，DpDNet表现优于现有模型，并成功用于乳腺癌生存分析。

Conclusion: DpDNet可作为个性化风险分层的工具，帮助优化治疗策略。

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and
variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic
signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as
a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different
cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers
in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,
we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific
prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared
knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early
introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to
adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset
with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax
for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the
potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification,
supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving
outcomes. Code is available at https://github.com/XinglongLiang08/DpDNet.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

TL;DR: PILOC是一个基于局部感知和通信的多代理搜索与救援框架，通过信息素逆向引导机制和深度强化学习，提高了搜索效率和系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和未知环境中的目标不可预测性和环境不确定性给多代理搜索与救援（MASAR）带来了挑战。

Method: PILOC利用局部感知和通信，引入信息素逆向引导机制，并将其嵌入深度强化学习的观察空间，支持间接代理协调。

Result: 实验表明，PILOC在动态和通信受限场景下表现优于现有方法，显著提高了搜索效率和适应性。

Conclusion: PILOC为未来MASAR应用提供了有前景的方向，尤其在动态和通信受限环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯混合模型（GMM）的自适应无监督异常检测算法，仅使用电机扭矩数据检测电缆驱动并联机器人（CDPRs）的异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDPRs在负载操作任务中需检测异常以确保安全，但传统方法依赖额外传感器。研究目标是仅用电机扭矩数据实现高效异常检测。

Method: 采用GMM拟合无异常数据，通过马氏距离实时检测异常，并动态更新模型参数以适应环境变化。

Result: 在14次长时间测试中，方法实现了100%真阳性率和95.4%平均真阴性率，检测延迟仅1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在无额外传感器情况下，对漂移和环境变化具有更高鲁棒性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Method: 研究多种线性和非线性机器学习模型，发现非线性集成方法表现最佳；开发基于共形预测的框架量化预测不确定性。

Result: 非线性集成方法具有最佳泛化性能；共形预测框架能提供理论保证的预测区间。

Conclusion: 共形预测框架有效解决了软体机器人运动学建模中的不确定性量化问题。

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖主观人为标注，存在偏差和局限性，需更客观的分类方法。

Method: 采用基于预测分歧原则（PDP）的规则分类方法，应用于简化AEBS。

Result: 揭示了方法的优势、局限及系统需求，结合人为标注可提升分类透明度和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法可补充现有实践，为更可靠、可复现的AEBS验证框架铺路。

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

Motivation: 摄影收藏的快速增长超过了人工编目能力，促使使用视觉语言模型（VLMs）自动化生成元数据。

Method: 使用InternVL2模型为考古照片生成目录描述，由专家和非专家评估分类、质量及对AI工具的信任度。

Result: 分类表现高于随机水平，但OCR错误和幻觉限制了质量感知；专家对AI工具的接受度较低。

Conclusion: 建议AI辅助生成草稿，但需人类验证以确保准确性，尤其在专业领域；建立透明AI流程以增强专业信任。

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

Conclusion: 该方法在多输入观测下能有效减少预测标签集大小，同时保持分类条件覆盖保证。

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

Conclusion: 利用未简化边界矩阵的信息可在计算成本和性能上为拓扑特征机器学习管道带来优势。

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

Motivation: 解决SMC方法中后验近似准确性和计算效率的问题，特别是在高维或复杂模型中，传统的一阶方法可能表现不佳。

Method: 在SMC$^2$中引入二阶信息（Hessian矩阵），结合梯度信息，设计更高效的提议分布，以优化粒子探索和重要性权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，二阶提议在步长选择和后验近似准确性上优于其他提议方法。

Conclusion: 二阶提议在SMC$^2$框架中具有显著优势，能够提升计算效率和后验近似质量。

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA结合了经典时间序列建模和非参数回归的优势。

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which
offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

Conclusion: MM2IM显著提升TCONV在边缘设备的效率，优于现有加速器至少2x GOPs/DSP。

Abstract: Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant
Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output
mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies
further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on
resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we
propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix
Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on
resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design
toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV
problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a
dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance
of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving
up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV
accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate
MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x

level of precision in sound source localization. In addition to our model, we
also present a new dataset of simulated spatial audio-caption pairs. Evaluation
of our models demonstrate that they are capable of matching the semantic
alignment and audio quality of state of the art models while capturing the
desired spatial attributes.

*Dimitrios Bralios,Jonah Casebeer,Paris Smaragdis*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Re-Bottleneck”的后处理方法，通过修改预训练自编码器的瓶颈结构，优化潜在空间以满足多样化下游任务的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经音频编解码器和自编码器通常以重建保真度为目标，忽略了潜在空间结构对多样化下游任务的重要性。

Method: 在预训练自编码器的瓶颈中引入“Re-Bottleneck”，通过潜在空间损失训练，以注入用户定义的结构。

Result: 在三个实验中验证了方法的有效性：1）对潜在通道排序；2）与语义嵌入对齐；3）引入等变性。

Conclusion: Re-Bottleneck框架灵活高效，能够以最小额外训练成本满足多样化应用需求。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.

Method: 研究扩展了LLM压缩工具包，集成了两种ASR模型（Whisper和Moonshine）、八种PTQ方法、统一的数据校准和评估流程，以及详细的分析工具，系统评估了量化对模型性能的影响。

Result: 结果表明，即使使用3位量化，高容量ASR模型在先进PTQ技术下仍能保持性能，揭示了效率与准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为在低功耗边缘设备上优化ASR模型提供了有价值的见解，展示了量化技术的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live
transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on
resource constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents
substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power.
Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an
effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining.
Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced
quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.
In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art
(SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and
Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,
memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR
leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on
both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression
toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced
quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline,
and detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even 3-bit quantization can succeed
on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on
edge devices.

Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly
expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide
unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in
accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large
language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training

LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical
information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability
constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and
other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports),
effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the
autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the
CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g.,
enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative
potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据空间中语义数据在DLT上高效存储的空白。

Method: 使用真实知识图谱对不同类型DLT（公有、私有、混合）进行性能、存储效率、资源消耗及数据更新查询能力的比较。

Result: 私有DLT在语义数据存储和管理中最高效，混合DLT在公开审计与操作效率间提供平衡。

Conclusion: 根据数据主权需求选择合适DLT基础设施对去中心化数据生态系统至关重要。

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

TL;DR: 分析机器学习任务中集体通信行为对网络性能的影响，并提出优化框架和拓扑结构的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习任务中的集体通信操作可能导致高带宽和突发流量，引发网络拥塞和丢包，影响性能。

Method: 通过Nvidia集体通信库的日志功能分析多种模型的通信行为，调整并行度、节点数和模型类型等参数。

Result: 发现现有集体通信框架和网络拓扑需要优化以适应网络异常对工作负载的影响。

Conclusion: 建议重新设计集体通信框架和网络拓扑以提升性能。

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Helix Parallelism是一种混合执行策略，通过KV并行和TP/EP并行优化LLM推理效率，减少Token-to-Token延迟并支持更大批量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM扩展到数百万token的KV历史，实时自回归解码在高Token-to-Token延迟（TTL）约束下面临压力，主要瓶颈是FFN权重访问和长KV缓存读取。

Method: 提出Helix Parallelism，结合KV并行和TP/EP并行，引入轻量通信步骤和Helix HOP-B技术以减少通信开销。

Result: Helix在固定批量下减少TTL达1.5倍，支持32倍更大批量，提升了DeepSeek-R1的吞吐量-延迟Pareto效率。

Conclusion: Helix Parallelism使超长序列实时推理成为可能，优化了Blackwell架构上的性能。

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at
fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency
budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on
Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型分布式训练框架，能在不可靠连接下保持模型准确性和收敛性，通过无偏梯度聚合和有界参数漂移实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式框架依赖可靠连接，导致尾延迟和可扩展性问题，而不可靠连接可能因丢包影响模型性能。

Method: 采用两阶段防御机制：无偏梯度聚合和有界参数广播，确保梯度估计一致性和模型参数稳定性。

Result: 在LLAMA2 7B模型上实验表明，容忍10%丢包时困惑度变化不超过0.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了高效通信协议与大规模模型训练需求之间的鸿沟，支持在普通或广域网络上进行鲁棒学习。

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

*Zihan Zhang,Leon Wong,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Ampere是一种新型的联邦学习系统，通过减少设备计算和通信开销，同时提高模型准确性，解决了Split Federated Learning (SFL)的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFL系统虽然减少了设备计算负担，但引入了大量通信开销并降低了非独立同分布（non-IID）数据的模型准确性。Ampere旨在同时优化计算、通信和准确性。

Method: Ampere采用单向块间训练和轻量级辅助网络生成方法，避免梯度传输，减少中间交换，并通过整合激活数据来应对数据异构性。

Result: 实验表明，Ampere在模型准确性、训练时间、通信开销和设备计算方面显著优于SFL基线系统，且对非IID数据表现更稳定。

Conclusion: Ampere通过创新设计在联邦学习中实现了计算、通信和准确性的平衡，为处理异构数据提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

Motivation: 美国每年因计划外停电损失超过1500亿美元，现有预测性维护模型未能充分考虑电网故障的空间、时间和因果关系。

Method: 结合图注意力网络（空间）、图卷积网络（时间）和图同构网络（因果关系），通过注意力加权嵌入融合数据。

Result: 模型在30天F1-score上达到0.8935，优于XGBoost和随机森林3.2%和2.7%，且聚类分析识别出8个风险组，最高风险组年故障388.4次。

Conclusion: 该框架为电网主动管理提供了改进的故障预测和风险感知聚类方法。

Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually,
partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial,
temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a
multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable
resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from
Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework
integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks
(temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through
attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935
+/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and
single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops
performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering
on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The
highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and
602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62
incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster
separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a
Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports
proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware
substation clustering.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was
constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into
three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2)
maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a
combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further
ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on
the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a
methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case,
and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon
dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and
effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with
multiple, often conflicting, objectives.

Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are
currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the
process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal
patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) since 2018, there is increasing interest in analytical
approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ
availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage
longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling
of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and
evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our
best model achieves a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, significantly
outperforming previous models. Key predictors align with known risk factors
while also revealing novel associations. Our findings can support urgency

TL;DR: IML-Spikeformer是一种新型的脉冲神经网络架构，专为大规模语音处理设计，通过输入感知多级脉冲机制和重参数化脉冲自注意力模块，显著提升了性能并降低了能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在大规模语音处理任务中性能不足，主要受限于训练时的高计算开销和缺乏专用架构。

Method: 提出IML-Spikeformer，结合输入感知多级脉冲（IMLS）机制和HD-RepSSA模块，优化脉冲发射和注意力映射。

Result: 在AiShell-1和Librispeech-960数据集上分别达到6.0%和3.4%的词错误率，能耗降低4.64倍和4.32倍。

Conclusion: IML-Spikeformer在性能和能效上均显著优于传统SNNs，为大规模语音处理提供了可行的SNN解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms,
represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers
energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve
competitive performance on large-scale speech processing task. Two key
challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training
caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN
architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we
introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking
Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech
processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)
mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep
using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further
integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a
Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module
enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale
temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that
IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on
Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing
theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$
respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures
for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy

*James P. Crutchfield*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 多组分混合物的结构复杂性远超其各部分的简单叠加，甚至可能是无限复杂的。这与统计混合物的概念形成对比，后者忽略了层次组织的涌现特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多组分混合物的结构复杂性，揭示统计混合物在描述层次组织方面的不足。

Method: 对比多组分混合物与统计混合物的结构特性，分析其复杂性差异。

Result: 发现多组分混合物具有新的结构复杂性，并对系统遍历性产生广泛影响。

Conclusion: 多组分混合物的结构复杂性远超统计混合物，这对理解系统层次组织和遍历性具有重要意义。

Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much
more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely
more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical
mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent
hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural
complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad
consequences for system ergodicity.

### [213] [Time Series Foundation Models for Multivariate Financial Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07296)
*Ben A. Marconi*

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: TSFMs（时间序列基础模型）在金融时间序列预测中表现出潜力，尤其在数据有限的任务中，但需进一步优化以适应金融领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融时间序列预测中的非线性关系、时间依赖性和数据稀缺问题。

Method: 评估两种TSFMs（TTM和Chronos）在三个金融预测任务中的表现，比较预训练模型与未训练模型的性能。

Result: 预训练模型在有限数据下表现更优，零样本性能超越基准，但传统模型在部分任务中仍占优。

Conclusion: TSFMs在金融预测中具有前景，但需领域特定优化。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to
complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable
interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks
involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market
assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution
through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific
adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)
across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,
EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM
exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version
of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained
version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and
15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's
zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting
and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can
surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model
consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable
performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant
sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,
traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of
three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific
optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer
substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,
data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires
domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial
time series characteristics.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机近端梯度的混合整数双层优化算法（SPG-MIBO），用于联合建模和优化无线定位与感知任务，利用MIMO-OFDM系统的高维CSI特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线网络中，高性能的定位与感知技术对智能应用至关重要，但现有方法在高维CSI特性下的联合建模研究不足。

Method: 将定位与感知建模为混合整数双层深度学习问题，提出SPG-MIBO算法，支持高维和大规模数据集，具有计算和内存效率。

Result: 多数据集实验验证了算法的有效性，并展示了联合优化的性能提升。

Conclusion: SPG-MIBO算法为无线定位与感知的联合优化提供了高效且理论保障的解决方案。

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DAF框架通过系统级优化实现高效动态量化训练，显著减少内存使用并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动和边缘设备上动态激活量化的系统级挑战，如计算开销和内存碎片。

Method: 开发混合归约操作、CPU-GPU协作位打包和重要性感知分页内存管理。

Result: 内存使用减少22.9倍，速度提升3.2倍，且不影响训练精度。

Conclusion: DAF是资源受限环境下可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成式全景图像拼接方法，通过微调扩散修复模型解决传统方法和现有生成模型在复杂场景下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接方法在存在视差、光照变化或风格差异时会产生伪影，而现有生成模型难以合成大范围连贯的全景图。

Method: 微调基于扩散的修复模型，使其能够基于多张参考图像生成无缝且视觉连贯的全景图。

Result: 在图像质量和场景布局一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂场景下的全景图像拼接问题，生成结果更自然和一致。

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

Result: 实验表明MMoE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择模态信息，显著提升了MEL性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在实际场景中容易产生幻觉。论文从模态冲突的角度研究这一现象，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 论文定义了模态冲突并构建了MMMC数据集，提出了基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的三种方法来缓解幻觉。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了模态冲突对MLLMs幻觉的影响，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用环境下，无人机需依赖视觉扫描大范围搜索区域，且计算资源受限，亟需高效的目标船舶识别与定位方法。

Method: 结合YOLOv8目标检测模型、特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析，通过几何原理定位目标船舶。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中验证了方法的可行性，并评估了视角对检测精度和定位准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在GNSS不可用环境下能有效实现目标船舶的自主检测与定位，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在多语言覆盖上存在不足，导致输出偏见和不公平，缺乏多语言能力的评估。

Method: 构建包含6,875对图像-文本数据的数据集，评估指标包括偏见、答案相关性和忠实度。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini2.5）整体表现最佳，开源模型（如Gemma3、Qwen2.5）在某些语言上表现优异。

Conclusion: LinguaMark为多语言LMMs评估提供了工具，Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现突出。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动转移方法主要关注人类运动，忽略了动物独特习惯行为的保留，因此需要一种新方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于生成框架，引入习惯保持模块和类别特定习惯编码器，结合LLM以支持未观察物种的运动转移。

Result: 通过DeformingThings4D-skl数据集进行实验和定量分析，验证了模型的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效保留了动物习惯行为，为跨类别运动转移提供了新思路。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SpatialViz-Bench，一个多模态基准测试，用于评估空间可视化能力，发现当前MLLMs在此任务上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未被充分评估。

Method: 开发了包含12个任务和1,180个自动生成问题的SpatialViz-Bench，评估了33个先进MLLMs。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在反直觉行为（如2D到3D性能骤降），且依赖公式推导而非可视化。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench填补了领域空白，显示MLLMs在空间可视化任务上仍有不足。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Motivation: 解决长视频推理的独特挑战，提升视觉语言模型在长视频中的表现。

Method: 整合大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason、两阶段训练流程（CoT-SFT和RL）以及高效训练基础设施MR-SP。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1是VLMs在长视频推理中的重要进展，并公开了支持多模态RL训练的系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面评估视觉推理能力的基准，尤其是复杂场景中的目标感知和推理能力。

Method: 提出TreeBench基准，基于三个原则构建，并开发TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习联合优化定位和推理。

Result: TreeBench包含405个高难度视觉问答对，现有模型表现不佳（如OpenAI-o3仅54.87%准确率）。TreeVGR显著提升了多个基准的性能。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate

TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）的方法，用于检测皮肤病变中的蓝白色面纱（BWV），并通过可解释人工智能（XAI）解释模型决策，显著提高了BWV检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蓝白色面纱（BWV）是黑色素瘤诊断的关键特征，但现有研究有限。本研究旨在开发一种高效、准确的BWV检测方法，以辅助早期黑色素瘤诊断。

Method: 使用未标注的皮肤病变数据集，通过颜色阈值技术生成标注数据。设计并训练了一个自定义层的DCNN模型，在多个数据集上进行测试，并应用XAI解释模型决策。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，测试准确率分别为85.71%（PH2）、95.00%（ISIC）、95.05%（PH2+ISIC）和90.00%（Derm7pt）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有模型，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的OoD分割方法存在边界不精确、异常分数不一致和背景噪声导致的误报问题，需要改进。

Method: 1. Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) 使用现有OoD骨干网络；2. Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) 利用SAM生成的实例掩码进行对象级分数归一化；3. Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) 应用拉普拉斯滤波和高斯平滑优化边界。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象感知的分数校准和边界优化，显著提升了OoD分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 现有LVLMs在CoT推理中常忽略生成的中间理由，影响了多模态推理的准确性和忠实度。

Method: 将多模态CoT推理重新定义为基于KL约束的奖励最大化问题，提出RED解码策略，结合视觉和理由信息。

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED为提升LVLMs的CoT推理提供了一种实用且有效的方法，推动了更可靠的多模态系统发展。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在真实数据集偏移下图像分类的校准状态，为实践者提供稳健校准的指导。

Method: 比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），在多个自然偏移和分类任务中进行实验。

Result: 熵正则化和标签平滑结合效果最佳；后处理校准方法在少量语义OOD数据下更稳健；新校准方法未必优于简单方法；校准偏移常以牺牲分布内校准为代价。

Conclusion: 结合预训练模型和集成方法能获得最佳校准效果，集成前校准更有效。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: ViaPT提出了一种实例感知的视觉提示调优方法，通过结合数据集级和实例级提示，利用PCA保留关键信息，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法使用固定数据集级提示，导致性能不佳，因为下游数据集差异大。

Method: 提出ViaPT，为每个输入生成实例感知提示，并与数据集级提示融合，利用PCA保留重要信息。

Result: 在34个数据集上实验表明，ViaPT优于现有方法，同时减少了可学习参数。

Conclusion: ViaPT为视觉提示调优提供了新范式，平衡了数据集级和实例级知识。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Motivation: 研究图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）的遗忘技术（MU）在多模态对抗输入下的鲁棒性不足问题。

Method: 提出Recall框架，利用对抗图像提示优化，结合参考图像，测试十种先进遗忘方法。

Result: Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上优于基线方法，揭示了当前遗忘机制的漏洞。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的遗忘机制以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Conclusion: 通过结构化语义中介，实现了与认知对齐的EEG视觉解码，为神经科学和可解释AI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型通常无法从原始视频数据中学习到有意义的几何感知结构，因此需要一种方法来弥合模型与3D物理世界之间的差距。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing方法，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两种对齐目标，引导模型学习几何感知的潜在表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相机视角和动作条件视频生成任务中显著提升了视觉质量和3D一致性。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升视频扩散模型的几何感知能力。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（LLMs）因时空令牌数量庞大导致计算复杂度呈二次方增长，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: STTM采用从粗到细的搜索策略将每帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中表现优异，50%令牌预算下实现2倍加速且准确率仅降0.5%，30%预算下3倍加速且准确率降2%。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效、查询无关的令牌合并方法，适用于视频理解任务。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统使用固定长度表示，忽略了输入数据的复杂性或熟悉度变化，而自适应分词方法通常需要多次编码搜索。

Method: KARL采用单次前向传播预测分词数量，训练过程类似倒置强化学习，根据重建质量条件预测分词停止。

Result: KARL性能与现有自适应分词器相当，但仅需单次操作，并分析了编码器/解码器大小、连续/离散分词等因素的缩放规律。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像分词与算法信息理论的关联，其预测的图像复杂性与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法存在次优均值寻求问题，需要更有效的对齐方法。

Method: 提出DMPO方法，通过最小化反向KL散度对齐扩散模型。

Result: DMPO在人类评估和自动指标上均优于现有技术，PickScore提升至少64.6%。

Conclusion: DMPO为扩散模型偏好对齐提供了稳健且优雅的解决方案，连接理论与实际性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices
demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency.
This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning
architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated
recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency
without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets,
TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs.
DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the

systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all
materials in this work for future

TL;DR: 论文研究了CLIP和大型多模态模型（LMMs）在训练数据中概念组合对组合泛化能力的影响，发现词共现统计（PMI）与模型性能高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨训练数据中概念组合对模型组合泛化能力的影响，特别是常见物体在不常见配对中的表现。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）衡量词共现频率，通过合成图像和自然图像编辑实验验证PMI与模型性能的关系。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确率高度相关（r=0.97），且此效应在自然图像和LMMs中同样存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进多模态模型组合泛化能力的必要性，而非单纯扩展训练数据。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Result: 指出政策杠杆（如出口管制）仍有效，同时承认去中心化AI的潜在好处。

Conclusion: 支持更精确的政策制定，以应对计算、能力扩散和去中心化AI发展的挑战。

Abstract: Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from
centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across
multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This
paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised
training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse.
We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased
risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of
detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new
paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we
emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We
also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including
privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and
mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise
policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI
development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对联合广告的最优机制，并在多广告位场景下设计了BundleNet方法，显著提升了平台收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合广告通过捆绑多个广告主提升效率和收入，但现有机制未能实现最优分配。

Method: 在单广告位场景下提出最优机制；多广告位场景下设计BundleNet神经网络方法。

Result: BundleNet在单广告位场景下接近理论最优，多广告位场景下表现最佳，显著提升收入。

Conclusion: BundleNet是一种高效的联合广告机制，兼顾收入提升和策略兼容性。

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

Conclusion: 单纯形在多面体近似中具有独特的性质，无法被非平凡近似，且是唯一满足“外加法”的凸体。

Abstract: We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing
polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we
study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given
depth. Our main results imply that simplices can only be ``trivially
approximated''. On the way, we obtain a characterization of simplices as the
only ``outer additive'' convex bodies.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now
reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks.
SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and
one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment,
and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies
fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration
with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment
is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared
geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a
universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training
paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry.
Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while
maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but
trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and
lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high
improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate
that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage
workflows for structure-based molecular design.

Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are
restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness
within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of
gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this
study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of
biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner
spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data,
literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To
distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we
devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different
data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings
capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of
embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for
Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a
machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these
heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated
this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated
consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in
missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling
of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable
multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning
applications.
