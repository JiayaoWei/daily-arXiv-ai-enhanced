### [1] [IndoPref: A Multi-Domain Pairwise Preference Dataset for Indonesian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22159)
*Vanessa Rebecca Wiyono,David Anugraha,Ayu Purwarianti,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍首个完全由人类撰写的印尼语偏好数据集IndoPref，用于评估LLM生成文本的自然性和质量，填补印尼语在偏好研究中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼语在LLM偏好研究中代表性不足，现有数据集多为英语翻译，缺乏文化和语言真实性。

Method: 创建IndoPref数据集，所有标注均为印尼语原生撰写，并使用Krippendorff's alpha评估标注一致性。

Result: 数据集在多LLM上进行了基准测试，评估了各模型的输出质量。

Conclusion: IndoPref填补了印尼语偏好数据集的空白，为LLM评估提供了文化和语言真实性的基准。

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

### [2] [Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22168)
*Kimberly Le Truong,Riccardo Fogliato,Hoda Heidari,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前评估大语言模型（LLM）的基准测试缺乏写作风格多样性，可能导致模型在非标准输入下表现不稳定。作者通过改写评估提示，验证了写作风格对模型性能的影响，并提出了一种可扩展的方法来增强基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试的写作风格单一，无法全面反映人类沟通的多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现不佳。

Method: 使用基于角色的LLM提示方法，低成本模拟多样化的写作风格，改写评估提示。

Result: 即使语义内容相同，写作风格和提示格式的变化显著影响LLM的性能评估。某些写作风格会一致性地触发模型的高或低性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展的方法来增强基准测试，提高其在语言多样性下评估LLM性能的外部有效性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

### [3] [A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22187)
*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化流程，利用大语言模型（LLM）估计动词框架频率（VFFs），优于现有工具，并生成更全面的VFF数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上有限，无法满足需求。

Method: 使用LLM生成句子语料库，并模拟专家语言学家分析其句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于现有句法分析器，且资源消耗低。

Conclusion: 为自动化框架频率估计提供了概念验证，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

### [4] [The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22201)
*L. Toschi,S. Torrisi,A. Fronzetti Colladon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 媒体记忆性（媒体内容对初创企业名称在投资者记忆中的印象能力）显著影响风险投资决策，而不仅仅是媒体曝光频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注媒体曝光，忽略了媒体内容对投资决策的更深层次影响。

Method: 通过分析197家英国微纳米技术初创企业（1995-2004年）的数据，研究媒体记忆性对投资结果的影响。

Result: 媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果，投资者关注初创企业的独特性和在新闻语义网络中的关联性。

Conclusion: 初创企业应通过更有针对性的媒体报道强调其独特性，而不仅仅是频繁曝光。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

### [5] [How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22209)
*Christian Clark,Byung-Doh Oh,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言模型的首子词标记估计的上下文熵低估了真实的词熵，蒙特卡罗（MC）估计方法提供了更准确的词熵测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨首子词标记估计的上下文熵是否准确，以及其对心理语言学研究中熵相关效应的影响。

Method: 采用蒙特卡罗（MC）估计方法生成词熵，允许词跨越多个标记，并与首子词标记估计进行比较。

Result: 回归实验显示首子词标记估计与MC词熵结果存在差异，表明首子词近似方法需谨慎使用。

Conclusion: 蒙特卡罗方法更准确地测量词熵，建议避免依赖首子词标记近似估计。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

### [6] [RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22219)
*Dongyub Jude Lee,Zhenyi Ye,Pengcheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习框架，通过动态反馈替代静态三元组，利用GPT-4o提供高质量反馈，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖静态三元组数据集且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈解决这些问题。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程，通过演员生成假设、教师模型（GPT-4o）优化，并结合负编辑距离和COMET分数进行奖励。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义充分性和实体保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和教师模型优化，显著提升了机器翻译的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

### [7] [Meaning-infused grammar: Gradient Acceptability Shapes the Geometric Representations of Constructions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22286)
*Supantho Rakshit,Adele Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部表征反映了基于功能的梯度性，支持了使用-建构主义（UCx）的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否能够学习到基于功能的梯度性语言表征，以支持UCx理论。

Method: 分析Pythia-1.4B模型中对英语双宾语和介词宾语结构的神经表征，使用5000对句子数据集，通过几何方法（如能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度）测量表征的可分性。

Result: 模型表征的可分性随人类偏好强度的梯度变化而变化，更典型的例子在激活空间中占据更独特的区域。

Conclusion: LLMs能够学习到丰富、基于意义的梯度性语言表征，支持了建构主义原则在模型中的几何测量。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

### [8] [Intent Recognition and Out-of-Scope Detection using LLMs in Multi-party Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22289)
*Galo Castillo-López,Gaël de Chalendar,Nasredine Semmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合BERT和LLM的混合方法，用于零样本和少样本场景下的意图识别和OOS检测，提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务导向对话系统（TODS）需要大量标注数据，传统方法成本高，因此提出一种更高效的混合方法。

Method: 结合BERT的计算效率和LLM的泛化能力，在零样本和少样本设置下进行意图识别和OOS检测。

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上评估，发现共享BERT输出给LLM能提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 混合方法在意图识别和OOS检测中表现优异，为TODS提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

### [9] [A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Negation for NLP and Neural Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22337)
*Roxana Petcu,Samarth Bhargav,Maarten de Rijke,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究否定在神经信息检索和LLM模型中的表现，提出否定分类法、生成基准数据集，并提出逻辑分类机制以改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂推理任务中的否定问题，提升神经信息检索和LLM模型在否定查询中的表现。

Method: 引入否定分类法，生成两个基准数据集，提出逻辑分类机制分析检索模型性能。

Result: 分类法平衡了否定类型的数据分布，加速了NevIR数据集的收敛；分类模式揭示了现有数据集中否定类型的覆盖情况。

Conclusion: 提出的分类法和机制改进了模型对否定的处理能力，为未来研究提供了工具和见解。

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

### [10] [Traits Run Deep: Enhancing Personality Assessment via Psychology-Guided LLM Representations and Multimodal Apparent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22367)
*Jia Li,Yichao He,Jiacheng Xu,Tianhao Luo,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Traits Run Deep”的新型人格评估框架，通过心理学提示和多模态融合技术显著提升了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉跨模态的异步信号。

Method: 使用心理学提示引导大型语言模型提取人格语义，设计文本中心的多模态融合网络，包括降维、跨模态连接和文本特征增强模块。

Result: 在AVI验证集上MSE降低约45%，并在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和心理学提示显著提升了人格评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

### [11] [PATENTWRITER: A Benchmarking Study for Patent Drafting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22387)
*Homaira Huda Shomee,Suman Kalyan Maity,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PATENTWRITER框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成专利摘要，并通过多种评估指标验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专利申请过程中繁琐的撰写问题，利用LLMs提升效率。

Method: 提出PATENTWRITER框架，评估六种LLMs（如GPT-4、LLaMA-3）在专利摘要生成中的表现，采用零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略。

Result: 现代LLMs能生成高质量且风格合适的专利摘要，优于领域基线。

Conclusion: PATENTWRITER框架有效，代码和数据集开源以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种为K-2英语学习者生成阅读理解问题的新方法，确保全面覆盖学习内容并适应学习者的能力水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估阅读理解能力在阅读学习过程中至关重要，特别是针对低龄英语学习者。

Method: 利用语言模型生成多样化且难度可调的问题，基于FairytaleQA数据集进行评估。

Result: 该方法能够生成多种类型和难度的问题，有望成为AI驱动的英语教学工具的一部分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在生成适应性阅读理解问题方面具有潜力，适用于自主英语教学系统。

Abstract: Assessment of reading comprehension through content-based interactions plays
an important role in the reading acquisition process. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach for generating comprehension questions geared to K-2 English
learners. Our method ensures complete coverage of the underlying material and
adaptation to the learner's specific proficiencies, and can generate a large
diversity of question types at various difficulty levels to ensure a thorough
evaluation. We evaluate the performance of various language models in this
framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the
proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous
AI-driven English instructors.

### [13] [NeedleChain: Measuring Intact Long-Context Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22411)
*Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出NIAH基准可能高估了LLMs的长上下文理解能力，并提出新基准NeedleChain和改进策略ROPE Contraction。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIAH基准虽广泛使用，但可能无法准确评估LLMs的真实长上下文理解能力，因此需要更全面的评测方法。

Method: 提出NeedleChain基准，上下文全为查询相关信息，并引入ROPE Contraction策略改进LLMs的长上下文理解能力。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型也难以完全理解仅由10句相关信息组成的上下文，新基准能更全面评估性能。

Conclusion: NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction为LLMs的长上下文理解提供了更准确的评估和改进方法。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

### [14] [AI-generated stories favour stability over change: homogeneity and cultural stereotyping in narratives generated by gpt-4o-mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22445)
*Jill Walker Rettberg,Hermann Wigers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于英美文本训练的语言模型生成的故事在文化多样性上表现不足，呈现出叙事同质化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能生成具有文化多样性的故事，揭示AI生成内容的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和主题。

Result: 故事普遍遵循单一叙事结构，缺乏文化深度和冲突，偏向传统与稳定。

Conclusion: AI生成叙事的同质化是一种新型偏见，需在文化对齐研究中加以关注。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过混合架构设计，结合Transformer和SSM的优势，提升模型在长上下文记忆和计算效率方面的表现，同时挑战传统模型设计方法。

Method: 采用并行混合架构，结合Transformer的注意力机制和SSM的长上下文处理能力，优化模型设计、数据策略和训练动态。

Conclusion: Falcon-H1系列通过混合架构实现了高性能和高效率，适用于广泛的应用场景，并以开源许可发布，推动AI研究的可及性和影响力。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on

### [16] [What is an "Abstract Reasoner"? Revisiting Experiments and Arguments about Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22457)
*Tian Yun,Chen Sun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备抽象推理能力，发现零样本表现不佳，但通过微调部分参数可显著提升性能，但泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估LLMs的抽象推理能力，挑战现有观点，并探讨其实际意义。

Method: 在零样本和微调设置下测试LLMs性能，分析参数调整对任务表现的影响。

Result: 零样本表现差，但微调后性能接近完美，但泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义抽象推理能力，并讨论LLMs是否满足这一标准的重要性。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过前向和后向约束生成的方法，提升代码大语言模型（Code LLMs）在受控代码生成中的指令遵循能力，并引入了多语言基准IFEvalCode进行更细致的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，代码生成不仅需要正确性，还需满足编码风格、行数和结构约束等详细要求，现有模型在这些方面表现不足。

Method: 采用前向和后向约束生成方法，优化Code LLMs的指令遵循能力，并开发IFEvalCode基准，包含1.6K测试样本，支持七种编程语言和中英文查询。

Result: 实验表明，闭源模型在受控代码生成中优于开源模型，且模型在生成正确代码与精确遵循指令之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法和基准为提升Code LLMs的指令遵循能力提供了有效工具，揭示了模型在受控生成中的局限性。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过后训练技术提升小语言模型（SLMs）在Text-to-SQL任务中的表现，实验结果显示其方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署上有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳，因此研究如何通过后训练技术提升其性能。

Method: 利用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建了两个衍生数据集，并采用监督微调和基于强化学习的后训练方法，结合自一致性推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLM-SQL方法在BIRD开发集上平均提升了31.4分，0.5B和1.5B模型分别达到56.87%和67.08%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLMs在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，并展示了其潜力，相关数据和代码将开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理长文本、多语言电子健康记录时的局限性，以及临床幻觉和评估指标不可靠的问题。

Method: 将非结构化的纵向电子健康记录转化为患者特定的时间知识图谱，并与规范性指南知识图谱对齐。

Result: CliCARE在中文和英文数据集上显著优于基线方法，临床有效性得到专家认可。

Conclusion: CliCARE为临床决策支持提供了高效、可靠的解决方案，有望减少医生工作负担。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Motivation: 由于缺乏反映真实客户交互的基准数据集，企业难以选择合适的ViLLMs模型用于支持应用。

Method: 作者创建了CSConDa数据集，包含9000多个真实客户服务问答对，并提出了一个综合评估框架，对11个轻量级开源ViLLMs进行自动指标和句法分析。

Result: 研究揭示了模型的优势和弱点，解释了性能差异，并指出了改进的关键领域。

Conclusion: 通过建立稳健的基准和系统评估，该研究为企业选择适合的ViLLMs模型提供了依据，并推动了越南语大语言模型的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

TL;DR: ControlMed是一种医疗语言模型，通过细粒度控制标记让用户主动控制推理过程的长度，解决了现有推理LLMs在临床环境中因冗长推理导致的计算开销和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策对可靠支持的需求推动了高准确性和可解释性LLMs的应用，但现有模型推理过程冗长，影响实际部署。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）预训练大规模合成医疗指令数据集；2）监督微调多长度推理数据和显式长度控制标记；3）强化学习提升准确性和质量。

Result: 在多种英语和韩语医疗基准测试中，ControlMed表现与或优于现有模型，并能灵活平衡推理准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是临床问答和医疗信息分析的实用且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出CognitiveAttack框架，利用多认知偏差组合攻击LLM安全机制，显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制易受认知偏差攻击，但多偏差交互的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，生成嵌入优化偏差组合的提示，绕过安全协议。

Result: 在30种LLM中测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏差交互是强大攻击向量，研究为更鲁棒AI系统提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在多语言模型中的作用，尤其是放大这些神经元对模型行为的影响。

Method: 通过干预实验在18种语言（包括低资源语言）中放大语言特定神经元，并使用提出的LSS评分评估效果。

Result: 放大因子能有效引导输出至目标语言，但对跨语言任务表现普遍下降。

Conclusion: 语言特定神经元的放大对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Result: BALSAM为阿拉伯语LLM提供了统一的标准和评估工具，促进协作研究。

Conclusion: BALSAM有望推动阿拉伯语LLM的发展，填补现有空白。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Result: 发现神经元在深层聚集，非拉丁文字语言更具特异性；操控神经元能有效优化多语言任务表现。

Conclusion: 语言特异性神经元的操控可显著提升多语言任务性能，且语言相似性有助于操控效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Language-Neurons-Manipulation.

Result: 大模型普遍偏向自由左翼，语言和模型家族间存在显著差异，干预技术可有效操控政治立场。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可控性，需进一步研究其影响和调控方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉显性和隐性线索，实现了全面且无偏的面试表现评估。

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

Method: 提出TIRESRAG-R1框架，采用思考-检索-反思过程和多维度奖励系统（充分性奖励、推理质量奖励和反思奖励），并结合难度感知重加权策略和样本过滤。

Result: 在四个多跳QA数据集上表现优于现有RAG方法，并能泛化到单跳任务。

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1显著提升了RAG模型的推理能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of

### [30] [Resource-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Text Embeddings via Prompt Engineering and Contrastive Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22729)
*Benedikt Roth,Stephan Rappensperger,Tianming Qiu,Hamza Imamović,Julian Wörmann,Hao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过聚合技术、提示工程和对比微调，将预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）适配为高效的文本嵌入模型，并在MTEB基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成中表现出色，但其token级表示在聚合为文本嵌入时会丢失关键信息，而许多非生成任务需要精确的句子或文档级嵌入。

Method: 研究采用了三种策略：(i) token嵌入的聚合技术，(ii) 任务特定的提示工程，(iii) 通过对比微调进行文本级增强。

Result: 在MTEB的英文聚类任务中取得了最优性能，且注意力图分析显示微调后模型更关注语义相关词。

Conclusion: LLMs可以通过提示工程和资源高效的对比微调有效适配为文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

*Praveenkumar Katwe,Rakesh Chandra,Balabantaray Kali,Prasad Vittala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于奖励驱动的微调框架，通过优化实体幻觉指数（EHI）来减少生成摘要中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少抽象摘要中的幻觉是语言模型实际应用中的关键挑战。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型生成基线摘要，计算EHI分数，并通过强化学习微调模型参数，以EHI作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，EHI在多数据集上持续提升，实体级幻觉显著减少，且不影响流畅性或信息量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注，可扩展性强，并提供了可复现的Colab流程，便于进一步研究。

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Result: LLMs在区域知识上表现不足，自动评估指标与人类判断相关性低。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于评估LLMs的区域知识、研究跨语言一致性，并推动开放式问答评估指标的改进。

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

venues as a new entity type called dblp:Stream. In the earlier version of
DBLPLink, we trained KG-embeddings and re-rankers on a dataset to produce

based on the log-probabilities of the "yes" token output at the penultimate
layer of the LLM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化表示方法TaSoF和框架SPaGe，用于解决查询聚焦表摘要中自然语言计划的模糊性和缺乏结构性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划在查询聚焦表摘要中存在模糊性和缺乏结构性的问题，限制了其可扩展性和转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力。

Method: 提出结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，分三个阶段：结构化规划、基于图的执行和摘要生成，以捕获复杂依赖关系并实现并行执行。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表设置中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示方法显著提高了查询聚焦表摘要的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

*Kwesi Cobbina,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中上下文学习（ICL）的位置偏差（DPP偏差），发现演示（demos）在提示中的位置显著影响模型预测和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的性能对演示的选择和顺序敏感，但位置偏差尚未被充分研究。本文首次探讨了这一现象。

Method: 设计了系统性评估流程，引入ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE指标，量化演示位置变化对模型输出的影响。

Result: 实验表明，演示位置显著影响模型性能：开头位置最稳定，准确性提升高达6分；结尾位置则导致30%预测反转。小模型受影响最大。

Conclusion: DPP偏差对LLMs性能有显著影响，需在ICL设计中考虑演示位置优化。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决模型安全性问题。

Method: 通过线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct的内部表征。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致显著的表示偏移，集中在早期到中间层，并识别了敏感特征。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和层级特征，为检测和缓解LLM的欺骗行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

Method: 提出概念框架区分系统性思想的四种含义，分析系统性理想与连接主义的兼容性，并探讨AI模型是否需要系统性。

Result: 系统性理想比传统Fodorian概念更严格，AI的系统性需求应根据五种合理化理由动态调整。

Conclusion: 系统性需求需合理化理由调节，动态决定AI模型的系统性程度和时机。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理设计无法有效整合新观察以动态更新世界模型，导致规划与真实世界状态脱节。

Method: 引入分层状态抽象的CoEx架构，利用LLM推理协调动态子目标计划，并通过神经符号信念状态持续更新世界模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx在规划和探索方面优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型和分层规划，显著提升了LLM代理的规划能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Motivation: AI代理在复杂任务中表现不足且存在安全风险，需结合人类监督以提高性能和安全性。

Method: 开发Magentic-UI，支持多工具扩展，引入六种交互机制（如协同规划、任务防护等）。

Result: Magentic-UI在任务完成、交互能力、用户测试和安全评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: Magentic-UI为人机协作提供了安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估LLM的真实能力。

Method: 提出LLM-Crowdsourced方法，利用LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，满足动态、透明、客观和专业的评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程任务上验证了方法的优势，发现Gemini在问题设计能力上表现最佳，部分LLM存在基于记忆的回答行为，评估结果具有高一致性。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced方法能更全面、客观地评估LLM能力，揭示了传统方法难以发现的新现象。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

Motivation: 探讨AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性如何共同影响人类决策质量，以优化AI辅助决策的效果。

Method: 提出理论框架分析AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性的联合影响，并通过行为实验验证。

Result: 元认知敏感性高的AI能显著提升人类决策表现，即使其预测准确性较低。

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助决策时需同时考虑预测准确性和元认知敏感性，优化两者以实现更优决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的NBN计算方法，解决了其计算耗时问题，并首次揭示了OneMax和TSP问题的景观特征及算法局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NBN方法在连续优化问题中表现优异，但计算耗时且难以扩展到组合优化问题，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过理论推导证明NBN作为最大概率转移网络，并提出对数线性时间复杂度的NBN计算方法。

Result: 应用高效NBN算法发现OneMax的中立性、崎岖性和模态性，TSP的主要挑战为崎岖性、模态性和欺骗性，并指出EAX和LKH算法的局限性。

Conclusion: 高效NBN算法为组合优化问题的分析提供了新工具，揭示了算法在复杂景观中的行为特征和局限性。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

Motivation: 后疫情时代医疗需求激增与护理人员短缺，迫使急诊分诊系统需要创新的AI解决方案。

Method: 系统采用三个专业代理（RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent、DepartmentAgent），通过结构化提问机制和部门特定规则，将患者症状转化为准确的分诊建议。

Result: 实验结果显示，系统在四次交互后，一级科室分类准确率达89.2%，二级科室达73.9%。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI辅助分诊系统提供了一个可扩展框架，适应医疗机构异质性并确保临床决策的准确性。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Result: 在文本和实际任务上的实验表明，MetaAgent生成的系统优于其他自动设计方法，性能接近针对特定任务优化的人工设计系统。

Conclusion: MetaAgent框架解决了现有自动设计方法的局限性，能够高效生成高性能的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询，以简化知识图谱（KGs）在制造业中的应用。通过提供适当的上下文，LLMs能显著提高查询生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造业中知识图谱的数据管理强大但复杂，非专家难以使用SPARQL查询。LLMs的潜力在于自动翻译自然语言查询，但需解决上下文不足的问题。

Method: 评估多种策略，利用LLMs作为中介，从制造业知识图谱（如Bosch Line Information System KG和I40 Core Information Model）中检索信息，比较不同上下文输入方法的效果。

Result: 研究发现，提供适当的KG上下文能显著提升LLMs生成正确且完整SPARQL查询的能力，减少幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 上下文感知提示技术有助于LLMs更高效地访问复杂数据，推动制造业中的决策支持。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

Conclusion: asp-fzn是一个有竞争力的CASP求解器，尤其在支持线性约束方面表现突出。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAAC在多智能体协作任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在复杂架构下优化困难，现有自动配置框架性能提升有限，因此探索LLMs在优化SAT求解器中的应用。

Method: 1. 开发模块化求解器以满足LLMs兼容性；2. 提出无监督自动提示优化方法；3. 设计预搜索策略和进化算法。

Result: AutoModSAT性能提升50%，优于SOTA求解器30%，速度提升20%。

Conclusion: 该工作为AI驱动的启发式发现与关键系统优化提供了方法论和实证结果。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

Conclusion: 意图中心建模能有效弥合用户输入与产品发现目标之间的差距，为未来研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in
optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of
e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed
to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting
fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit
behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised
learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of
latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity,
intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of
adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user
intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query
rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and
downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product
verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight
the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user
inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation
for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.

Motivation: 现有生成式推荐模型因技术、参数和实验设置的差异难以直接比较，且缺乏统一的开源框架阻碍了系统研究和模型迭代。

Method: 提出了GRID框架，支持模块化设计，便于组件替换和快速迭代，并在公开基准上对GR模型的各个组件进行了系统实验和消融研究。

Conclusion: GRID为生成式推荐研究提供了统一的基准测试平台，促进了模型迭代和性能提升。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its
promising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing
to the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous
semantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID
sequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic
information and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the
benefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques,
hyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct
comparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an
open-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension,
slowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and
open-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely
GRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component
swapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically
experiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on
public benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many
overlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact
performance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an
open-source platform for robust benchmarking and GR research advancement. GRID

Conclusion: MMSC通过多模态和自监督学习有效解决了数据噪声和稀疏性问题，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item
representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and
complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item
associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or
leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook
critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to
the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose
MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning
framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three
main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that
leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a
self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and
learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation
aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic
and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training
data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct
extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC
outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and
39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that
MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.

Conclusion: GeoOutageKG通过整合多源数据，显著提升了停电检测、分析和预测的能力。

Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk
assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year,
exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data
are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution
and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers
excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image
data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more
comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing
the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.
However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating
spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge
representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and
predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal
knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light
satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and
county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for
constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,
GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual
outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from
2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and
reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We
demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power
outages.

on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,
optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.
This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole
recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of
recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places
user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large
language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,
and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into
an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the
above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a
multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced
pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative
judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.
Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance
gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and
satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.
These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that
LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually
beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

*Hai Ling,Tianchi Wang,Xiaohao Liu,Zhulin Tao,Lifang Yang,Xianglin Huang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AUV-Fusion是一个跨模态对抗攻击框架，通过高阶用户偏好建模和跨模态对抗生成，提升视觉感知推荐系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法（如虚假用户攻击和视觉扰动）成本高、易检测或难以匹配用户偏好，亟需更高效的攻击框架。

Method: 采用多跳用户-物品交互建模用户嵌入，通过MLP生成语义对齐的扰动，并注入预训练VAE的潜在空间。

Result: AUV-Fusion显著提升了目标（冷启动）物品的曝光率，同时保持高度隐蔽性。

Conclusion: AUV-Fusion为视觉感知推荐系统提供了一种高效且隐蔽的对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Visual-Aware Recommender Systems (VARS) exploit the integration of
user interaction data and visual features to deliver personalized
recommendations with high precision. However, their robustness against
adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to
system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable
limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only
perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these
challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework
that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary
generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop
user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned
perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a
pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating
genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion
eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates
the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in
traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS
architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly
enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional
baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under
rigorous scrutiny.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成员推理攻击（MIA）的隐私评分方法RecPS，用于量化推荐系统（RecSys）训练数据的隐私风险，支持隐私感知的模型开发和部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统依赖敏感的用户-物品交互数据，但缺乏评估交互数据隐私风险的方法，用户无法选择不分享高敏感数据。

Method: 提出RecPS方法，结合差分隐私和成员推理攻击（RecLiRA）量化交互和用户级别的隐私风险。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型上验证了RecPS在风险评估和模型遗忘中的独特优势。

Conclusion: RecPS为隐私感知的推荐系统开发提供了量化工具，支持用户隐私保护。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

TL;DR: CIMR框架通过上下文感知的迭代推理和自我修正模块，显著提升了多模态复杂任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言和视觉语言模型在复杂多模态指令中逻辑推理和动态反馈整合的不足。

Method: 提出CIMR框架，包含初始推理和迭代细化两阶段，动态融合多模态特征。

Result: 在MAP数据集上达到91.5%准确率，优于GPT-4V等现有模型。

Conclusion: CIMR的迭代推理和自我修正能力在复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应伪标签框架，通过原型一致性和邻域一致性提升CLIP在无监督适应中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督适应中，CLIP的零样本预测伪标签噪声大，传统固定阈值方法不可靠。

Method: 结合PICS（基于类内特征紧凑性和类间特征分离性评估伪标签准确性）和NALR（利用邻域样本语义相似性动态优化伪标签），并引入自适应加权机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，提供更准确的伪标签且计算高效。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升无监督适应性能，伪标签准确性高且计算效率良好。

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIR是一种无需额外训练的闭环提示优化框架，通过迭代优化提示词与图像的匹配，提升文本到图像生成的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型对提示词微小变化的敏感性，导致输出不一致或不准确的问题。

Method: 采用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）分析输出图像与用户提示，检测不匹配之处并生成优化后的提示词，迭代改进生成结果。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上提高了生成图像与提示词的对齐性和视觉连贯性，且无需修改底层模型。

Conclusion: TIR框架通过闭环优化显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了贝叶斯优化（BO）和多保真度贝叶斯优化（MFBO）在自旋体结构能量吸收（EA）问题中的表现，发现MFBO能比BO提升11%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着有限元模拟精度提高但计算成本增加，数据驱动设计需求增长，需要高效优化方法。BO和MFBO虽成功，但未在真实工程问题中直接比较，且采样质量和设计参数敏感性分析不足。

Method: 采用Sobol'样本和基于方差的敏感性分析降低设计复杂度，并比较BO和MFBO在自旋体结构EA最大化问题中的表现。

Result: MFBO在多种超参数设置下比BO表现更好，EA提升高达11%。

Conclusion: MFBO是解决昂贵数据驱动设计问题的有效方法，开源结果支持多保真度技术的实用性。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新型混合激活函数S3和S4，解决了传统激活函数的梯度消失和神经元死亡问题，S4在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数如ReLU存在神经元死亡问题，sigmoid和tanh存在梯度消失问题，需要更优的激活函数。

Method: 提出S3（Sigmoid-Softsign混合）和改进版S4（平滑过渡机制），通过实验验证其性能。

Result: S4在MNIST、Iris分类和Boston Housing回归任务中表现最佳，收敛更快且梯度稳定。

Conclusion: 混合激活函数是改进神经网络训练动态的有前景方向，S4因其可调参数和优异性能成为深度学习应用的通用选择。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法基于马尔可夫决策过程，假设环境状态完全决定系统演化，但实际场景中这一假设常不成立。此外，传统方法难以捕捉复杂网络拓扑的空间关系。

Method: 提出了一种时空RL方法，结合GNN捕捉网络拓扑的空间动态，RNN处理时间流量模式，以优化路由决策。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于传统RL技术，对网络拓扑变化的鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 时空RL方法在复杂通信网络中表现更优，为路由优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

Result: 实验表明，SourceSplice能以较少的子集探索高效识别高质量数据源组合。

Conclusion: SourceSplice在多种设置下表现出色，为数据源选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间序列数据集相似性度量中表现出色，支持基础模型的性能评估。

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

Result: 在NeuroFetalNet数据集上，CTG-Insight实现了96.4%的准确率和97.8%的F1分数，优于深度学习和单代理LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个可解释且可扩展的CTG分析框架，为远程胎儿监测提供了透明化的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric
power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather
variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential
for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term

scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式——表征赋权，强调通过内部知识结构的可控性和多样性来实现更通用的智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能研究过于关注外部目标和任务，导致智能体缺乏适应性。作者希望通过内部表征的赋权设计更灵活的系统。

Method: 提出表征赋权，将控制点转向内部，衡量智能体维持和多样化其知识结构的能力。

Result: 表征赋权为设计适应性强的智能系统提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 通过内部表征赋权，智能体可以更好地实现通用性和适应性。

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

TL;DR: W-CFM提出了一种改进的条件流匹配方法，通过加权训练对提升生成效率与准确性，避免了传统方法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFM生成的路径偏离直线插值，导致生成速度慢且精度低，而现有改进方法依赖计算昂贵的批量最优传输。

Method: 提出W-CFM，通过Gibbs核加权训练对，恢复熵最优传输耦合，并在大批量极限下与批量OT方法等价。

Result: 实验表明，W-CFM在生成质量、保真度和多样性上优于基线方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: W-CFM在提升生成性能的同时解决了计算瓶颈，是一种高效且有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于聚类的交叉验证策略，提出了一种结合Mini Batch K-Means和类别分层的新技术，并在平衡和不平衡数据集上进行了实验比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交叉验证可能无法充分代表数据多样性，导致性能估计偏差，因此需要研究更稳健的评估策略。

Method: 提出了一种结合Mini Batch K-Means和类别分层的新交叉验证技术，并在20个数据集上进行了实验比较。

Result: 新技术在平衡数据集上表现优异，但在不平衡数据集上传统分层交叉验证更优。聚类算法比较中无单一算法显著突出。

Conclusion: 研究改进了模型评估策略，强调了聚类数据分割的潜力，同时验证了传统分层交叉验证的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

TL;DR: CS-SHRED是一种新型深度学习架构，结合压缩感知（CS）和浅层循环解码器（SHRED），用于从不完整、压缩或损坏的数据中重建时空动态。


<details>

Motivation: 解决稀疏传感器布局、噪声测量和不完整数据采集等场景下的信号恢复问题。

Method: 通过结合CS技术和SHRED架构，使用基于批量的前向框架和ℓ1正则化，并引入自适应损失函数动态结合MSE和MAE。

Result: 在多个挑战性问题中验证，相比传统SHRED，CS-SHRED显著提高了重建保真度，改善了SSIM、PSNR等指标。

Conclusion: CS-SHRED是一种有前景的工具，适用于环境、气候和科学数据分析。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

Abstract: With the rapid amassing of spatial-temporal (ST) ocean data, many
spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address
various oceanic issues, including climate forecasting and disaster warning.
Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more
complicated but with unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high
sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM
models on ST ocean data. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of existing studies remains missing in the literature, which hinders not only
computer scientists from identifying the research issues in ocean data mining
but also ocean scientists to apply advanced STDM techniques. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey of existing STDM studies for ocean science.
Concretely, we first review the widely-used ST ocean datasets and highlight
their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement
techniques are explored. Next, we classify existing STDM studies in ocean
science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern
mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate on the techniques for these tasks.
Finally, promising research opportunities are discussed. This survey can help
scientists from both computer science and ocean science better understand the
fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM for ocean

Conclusion: 该框架无需外部数据或披露客户端模型架构，提供了隐私和灵活性，为未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的深度学习框架ParaSDM，用于参数化序列决策，结合最大熵原理和神经策略模型SPN，在FLPO问题中实现了高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设施选址和路径优化（FLPO）这一NP难问题，其混合离散-连续结构和非凸目标使得传统方法难以高效处理。

Method: 集成最大熵原理（MEP）与神经策略模型SPN，通过梯度优化共享参数，实现高效策略推断和梯度计算。

Result: SPN比MEP基线快100倍，最优性差距约6%；FLPO方法比元启发式基线成本低10倍，速度更快，且与Gurobi最优解匹配但快1500倍。

Conclusion: 结构化深度模型在大规模混合整数优化任务中表现出色，为ParaSDM问题设定了新标准。

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN在移动和边缘设备上的部署增加，优化模型效率变得至关重要。混合精度量化虽优于均匀量化，但找到每层最优精度仍具挑战性。

Method: MSQ采用圆钳位量化器计算权重的最低有效位（LSBs），并通过正则化诱导稀疏性，同时利用Hessian信息同时剪枝多个LSBs。

Result: 实验显示，MSQ相比之前的比特级量化方法，训练参数减少8倍，训练时间减少86%，同时保持竞争性精度和压缩率。

Conclusion: MSQ是一种适用于资源受限设备的高效DNN训练方法。

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Spec-VLA框架展示了推测执行在VLA预测场景中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: RCR-AF是一种有效的激活函数，能显著提升模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习中，样本类别不平衡会导致特征表示不足和模型预测空间受限，影响协作学习效果。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证了Proto-EVFL的优越性，在零样本场景下性能提升至少6.97%。

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL是首个双层次优化框架，具有收敛性保证，能有效解决类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Result: 在图像分类和生成任务中，LoReUn显著缩小了现有方法与精确遗忘的差距，有效减少有害内容生成。

Conclusion: LoReUn是一种简单高效的遗忘策略，能动态调整数据权重，提升有害内容的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

Conclusion: FGFP框架在压缩率和精度上优于现有方法，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

Conclusion: 提出的BN模型能有效理解事故与拥堵的复杂关系，为城市交通管理提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Result: 实验表明，当词频分布符合Zipf定律时，模型性能最佳。

Conclusion: Zipf定律对齐是一种鲁棒且通用的词汇量选择标准。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

Conclusion: RLDP在保持相同隐私保护水平的同时，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

Conclusion: 深度学习展示了理解细胞分裂模式及生成新假设的潜力。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

<details>

Motivation: CAR T细胞工程中，由于组合空间庞大且实验数据有限，探索新的CAR结构具有挑战性。

Method: 使用投影量子核（PQK）将经典数据嵌入高维希尔伯特空间，并通过核方法测量样本相似性。

Result: 在61量子位的门控量子计算机上，PQK在CAR T细胞毒性预测中优于经典机器学习方法，尤其在信息较少的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限的CAR T细胞工程问题中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

Method: 扩展了现有性能预测方法，直接估计完整混淆矩阵，并在真实和模拟分布偏移下进行基准测试。

Result: 提出的方法在医学图像分布偏移下可靠预测了临床相关计数指标，但模拟偏移场景暴露了现有技术的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解真实部署环境，以改进医学AI模型的性能监控技术。

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Conclusion: G-Core在RLHF训练中取得了先进成果，为未来大规模、人类对齐模型的研发提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative
tokens and events in electronic health records. Our approach considers incoming
data in the entire context of a patient's hospitalization and so can flag
anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal
range. We demonstrate that the events our model flags are significant for
predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified
as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained
on foundation model-derived representations.

Result: 在多个ImageNet预训练架构中，提取的特征具有高分辨率和感知对齐性。

Conclusion: 神经网络依赖可解释的模式，这一发现对知识发现和可信AI系统开发有深远意义。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for

three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%

Conclusion: RLVMR通过改进推理质量和效率，生成了更鲁棒、高效且可解释的智能体。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

Result: 算法满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私，收敛速度受网络拓扑影响，实验显示在中等隐私区间表现优异。

Conclusion: D-DP-PM在隐私与效用间取得良好平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic
structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead
of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the
optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach
devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the
method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a
surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation
method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping
between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space
determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the
parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional
representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an
educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the
intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing
equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential
errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the
design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.
Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation
capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The
quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by
reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while
achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective
functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to
extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

### [122] [Synchronization of mean-field models on the circle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22857)
*Yury Polyanskiy,Philippe Rigollet,Andrew Yao*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了单位圆上n个相互作用粒子的平均场模型，提出了基于粒子相互作用函数三阶导数L1范数的同步准则，并解决了自注意力动力学的一个猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典的Kuramoto模型，研究粒子在单位圆上的全局同步现象，并解决自注意力动力学中的同步范围问题。

Method: 提出基于粒子相互作用函数三阶导数L1范数的一般同步准则，并应用于自注意力动力学模型。

Result: 证明了自注意力动力学在β≥-0.16时同步，显著扩展了之前0≤β≤1的范围，并发现β<-2/3时不会发生全局同步。

Conclusion: 提出的同步准则有效解决了自注意力动力学的同步范围问题，扩展了理论边界。

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对LEO卫星网络的半监督联邦学习框架，通过分层聚类聚合和通信优化技术，显著降低了处理时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO卫星网络在6G中扮演重要角色，但资源受限和动态性使得联邦学习的可靠收敛和效率成为挑战。

Method: 采用半监督联邦学习框架，结合分层聚类聚合、稀疏化和自适应权重量化技术，分两阶段进行聚合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法处理时间减少3倍，能耗降低4倍，同时保持模型精度。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为LEO卫星网络中的高效联邦学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Method: 提出VIOs机制系统生成违反约束的操作，构建基于大型语言模型的修复系统，并分析不同提示策略的性能。

Result: 包含相关SHACL约束和知识图谱关键上下文信息的简洁提示表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法为知识图谱修复系统的评估提供了更通用的框架，并验证了提示策略的重要性。

Abstract: We present a systematic approach for evaluating the quality of knowledge
graph repairs with respect to constraint violations defined in shapes
constraint language (SHACL). Current evaluation methods rely on \emph{ad hoc}
datasets, which limits the rigorous analysis of repair systems in more general
settings. Our method addresses this gap by systematically generating violations
using a novel mechanism, termed violation-inducing operations (VIOs). We use
the proposed evaluation framework to assess a range of repair systems which we
build using large language models. We analyze the performance of these systems
across different prompting strategies. Results indicate that concise prompts
containing both the relevant violated SHACL constraints and key contextual
information from the knowledge graph yield the best performance.

this is the first decentralised and asynchronous algorithm for solving

Conclusion: 论文提出的测试方法能够有效解决集合不变性问题，并通过数值示例验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is
it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In
this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods --
a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and
infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that
provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for
given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in
the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all
controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data
fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish
the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the
proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and
in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of
hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using
several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

Motivation: 许多数据科学应用需要检测高维变量之间的共享信号，但采样噪声会引入相关性干扰。本文旨在确定何时可以从样本相关性中检测和重建信号。

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论方法，分析三种协方差矩阵（自协方差、交叉协方差和联合协方差）的性能，并观察信号检测的相变现象。

Result: 发现联合协方差和交叉协方差比自协方差更早重建共享信号，且方法选择取决于变量维度是否匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择检测线性相关性的方法提供了指导，并可能推广到非线性统计依赖关系。

Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two
high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine
when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations,
despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider
three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional
variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the
self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the
self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous,
and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices,
and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the
shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross
approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the
variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right
method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may
generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

Method: 采用广义Hebbian学习规则构建块结构权重矩阵，模拟无定形固体的Hessian矩阵结构。

Result: 模型表现出能量间隙、各向异性相关性和有序-无序转变，记忆容量显著提高（γ_c≈0.55）。

Conclusion: 该模型在记忆容量和取向相关性方面与无定形固体物理有密切联系，为联想记忆提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model
inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are
replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$.
The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix
through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian
matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits
quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials:
energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random
configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations
encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and
order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N
\cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a
fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$)
and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between
associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in
systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the
scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim
(Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which
closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D
central-force spring networks.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了用户体验，扩展了应用场景，增强了多媒体系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）常因因果混淆导致性能下降，需要一种方法利用人类注视数据指导学习。

Method: GABRIL通过正则化损失，利用人类注视数据引导模型关注因果相关特征。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA实验中，GABRIL分别比行为克隆提升了179%和76%。

Conclusion: GABRIL不仅提升性能，还增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用归一化流（NF）估计自动驾驶系统（ADS）场景参数的概率密度函数（PDF），以改进安全验证中的风险量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全验证方法对自动驾驶系统的安全部署至关重要，但传统方法在参数独立性假设或维度灾难方面存在局限。

Method: 采用归一化流（NF）进行高维密度估计，避免了对PDF形状的限制性假设，并与核密度估计（KDE）进行比较。

Result: NF在风险不确定性估计上优于KDE，尽管计算资源需求更高，但对维度灾难不敏感。

Conclusion: NF在场景安全验证中具有潜力，未来可优化其架构和训练以增强适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

*Qian Qi*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对非凸几何不确定性模型的新型随机微积分，通过引入一类完全耦合的均值场正倒向随机微分方程（FBSDE），解决了传统次线性期望理论对非凸模型不敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统次线性期望理论无法处理非凸几何的原始不确定性模型，因此需要开发一种新的随机微积分方法。

Method: 引入一类完全耦合的均值场FBSDE，其中倒向随机微分方程（BSDE）的驱动项通过点态最大化定义，并假设驱动项对控制变量具有一致的强凹性。

Result: 证明了FBSDE系统的局部和全局适定性，并展示了所得估值函数（Θ-期望）的动态一致性和非次可加性。

Conclusion: 本研究为非凸内源性模糊下的随机微积分提供了严格的理论基础，突破了传统凸范式。

Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic
calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of
primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for
a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully
coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the
BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent,
non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong
concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which
ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central
contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from
primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire
well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for
the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation,
is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the
axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation
invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm.
This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class
of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.

Result: 加权Stack-SVD在性能上优于加权SVD-Stack，理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为实际数据集成问题提供了理论指导和方法选择依据。

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent
structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model
assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with
a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for
estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information
across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the
datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second
approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,
then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally
computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they
have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which
is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and
dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty
about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their
potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the
asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop
optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals
that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,
optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend
our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical
algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical
guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive
numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data
corroborate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: LVM-GP框架能够高效捕捉功能依赖性并提供鲁棒的不确定性量化，适用于PDE求解问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty
quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations
(PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from
the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling
uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture
consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder
implements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process
(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating
between a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with
the interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function
learned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over
the solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to
the latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible
function-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft
constraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE
structure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed
neural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can
efficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian
process and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and
robust uncertainty quantification. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and reliability of the method.

Abstract: Domain adaptation seeks to leverage the abundant label information in a
source domain to improve classification performance in a target domain with
limited labels. While the field has seen extensive methodological development,
its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing
theoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target
domains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to
measures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not
fully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a
shared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain
alignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature
transformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first
derive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers
of the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize
the sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous
analysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both
MMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound
that scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our
analysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited
labeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally
to the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental
evaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical
findings.

Result: 在多个细粒度分类基准测试中，提出的BoostCNN变体在预测性能和训练速度上均优于传统CNN。

Conclusion: 新框架不仅减轻了手动设计架构的负担，还提高了准确性和效率。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature
learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and
millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,
requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that
integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our
approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance
sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We
further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly
into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This
integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but
also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several
fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN
variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive
performance and training speed.

Abstract: Machine and deep learning have grown in popularity and use in biological
research over the last decade but still present challenges in interpretability
of the fitted model. The development and use of metrics to determine features
driving predictions and increase model interpretability continues to be an open
area of research. We investigate the use of Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) on a multi-view deep learning model applied to multi-omics data for the
purposes of identifying biomolecules of interest. Rankings of features via
these attribution methods are compared across various architectures to evaluate
consistency of the method. We perform multiple computational experiments to
assess the robustness of SHAP and investigate modeling approaches and
diagnostics to increase and measure the reliability of the identification of
important features. Accuracy of a random-forest model fit on subsets of
features selected as being most influential as well as clustering quality using
only these features are used as a measure of effectiveness of the attribution
method. Our findings indicate that the rankings of features resulting from SHAP
are sensitive to the choice of architecture as well as different random
initializations of weights, suggesting caution when using attribution methods
on multi-view deep learning models applied to multi-omics data. We present an
alternative, simple method to assess the robustness of identification of
important biomolecules.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for
developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into
muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and
computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation
of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we
demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on
sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters,
surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually
<10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively
distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5%
absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex
real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a
challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in
automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where
noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the
voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice
signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain
light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models
often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic
environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment,
but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a
noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing
and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach
significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires
neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly
in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD
additionally improving clean speech detection.

Conclusion: RedCoder为评估代码生成系统的安全性提供了可扩展且有效的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

Conclusion: RandLuzz通过LLM显著减少了模糊测试中的随机性，提高了错误检测效率。

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the

TL;DR: CodeEvo框架通过两个LLM代理（Coder和Reviewer）的迭代交互合成高质量代码数据，结合编译器和生成反馈机制，显著提升代码生成模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动获取高质量指令-代码对成本高且规模有限，现有方法缺乏严格验证，导致合成数据质量不佳。

Method: CodeEvo框架通过Coder生成代码和测试用例，Reviewer提供新指令和反馈，结合编译器与生成反馈机制控制质量。

Result: 实验表明，基于CodeEvo数据微调的模型在多种代码生成基准测试中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: CodeEvo为代码中心数据合成提供了有效方法，并通过多角度分析验证了其优势。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

*Honghua Dong,Jiacheng Yang,Xun Deng,Yuhe Jiang,Gennady Pekhimenko,Fan Long,Xujie Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TypyBench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在Python仓库中类型推断能力的基准，提出两种新指标TypeSim和TypeCheck，发现LLM在复杂嵌套类型和一致性上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态语言（如Python）的类型推断是软件工程中的难题，LLM在此领域的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入TypyBench基准，包含TypeSim（语义关系）和TypeCheck（类型一致性）两种指标，评估LLM在50个高质量Python仓库中的表现。

Result: LLM在TypeSim上表现尚可，但在复杂嵌套类型和类型一致性上存在显著问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注仓库级一致性而非类型相似性，TypyBench为此提供了基础。

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出利用科学论文中的方法描述作为大语言模型（LLM）的独立规范，实现按需代码生成，替代人工维护的软件库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少软件包维护成本（如依赖管理、错误修复和版本控制）。

Method: 通过让先进LLM（如GPT-4-mini-high、Gemini Pro 2.5、Claude Sonnet 4）根据科学论文中的方法描述实现核心算法，进行基准测试。

Result: 当前LLM能可靠复现软件包功能，性能与传统库无差别。

Conclusion: 未来可能转向灵活的按需代码生成，减少人工维护负担，利用论文作为自动化实现分析的上下文。

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency
management, bug fixes, and versioning. We show that rich method descriptions in
scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large
language models (LLMs), enabling on-demand code generation that could supplant
human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient
context for the automated implementation of analytical workflows.

TL;DR: RePaCA是一种基于大型语言模型的静态APCA技术，通过强化学习优化，显著提升了补丁正确性评估的准确性、泛化能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态APCA技术在可靠性、灵活性和透明度方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的方法来识别APR工具生成的过拟合补丁。

Method: 利用专门用于思考任务的大型语言模型（LLM），通过提示输入错误和修复代码片段，生成思维链分析补丁差异，并进行二元分类。通过强化学习（Group Relative Policy Optimization算法）对LLM进行微调。

Result: 在Defects4J测试集上达到83.1%的准确率和84.8%的F1分数，表现出卓越的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过微调和强化学习优化的LLM在静态APCA任务中具有显著潜力，能够提升准确性、泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

Conclusion: 蜕变测试是评估深度代码模型鲁棒性的有效方法，但仍需进一步研究以解决挑战。

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主系统缺乏整合用户独特伦理偏好的能力，降低了用户信任，且在多系统交互时难以达成伦理一致的决策。

Method: 提出RobEthiChor，一种领域无关的参考架构，支持伦理谈判；并实现RobEthiChor-Ros于机器人操作系统中。

Result: 实验显示，RobEthiChor-Ros在73%的场景中成功达成协议，平均谈判时间为0.67秒，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: RobEthiChor有效实现了自主系统的伦理谈判能力，提升了决策的个性化和伦理一致性。

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Repair-R1是一种改进的自动化程序修复（APR）方法，通过在训练阶段引入测试用例并优先生成测试，显著提升了修复成功率、测试生成成功率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based APR方法仅在推理阶段使用测试用例，忽略了测试用例在训练阶段的潜在贡献以及测试优先修复的可能性。

Method: Repair-R1在训练阶段引入测试用例，要求模型首先生成区分性测试用例，然后基于这些测试进行修复，并使用强化学习共同优化测试生成和修复。

Result: 实验表明，Repair-R1在四个基准测试中显著优于基线模型，修复成功率提升2.68%至48.29%，测试生成成功率提升16.38%至53.28%，覆盖率提升0.78%至53.96%。

Conclusion: Repair-R1通过优化测试用例的使用顺序和方式，显著提升了APR的效果，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects,
generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are
often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the
code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at

Result: 提出了物理失效的分类法，评估了多种检测方法（如深度学习和多模态模型），并总结了开发者的改进建议。

Conclusion: 研究为物理失效检测提供了新见解和资源，有助于未来改进物理引擎的可靠性。

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

Motivation: 现有模型在多模态任务中表现不稳定，尤其是在不同领域和难度级别上。

Result: VL-Cogto在主流多模态基准测试中表现优于或与现有模型相当。

Conclusion: PCuRL框架有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中存在信息错位和表示纠缠问题，限制了其在短提示任务中的泛化能力。

Result: SmartCLIP在多种任务中表现优异，验证了其处理信息错位的能力。

Conclusion: SmartCLIP通过灵活对齐和解耦表示，显著提升了跨模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法因样本量小和域异质性（如成像协议、扫描硬件和人口统计差异）导致模型泛化能力受限。

Method: CDA框架分三阶段：源数据监督训练、自监督目标特征适应和协作训练未标记目标数据，结合ViT和CNN提取全局和局部特征。

Result: 在多站点T1加权MRI数据上的实验表明，CDA优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA框架有效提升了LLD检测的泛化能力和域适应性。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Motivation: 解决大规模视频数据集的高计算和存储需求问题。

Method: 提出GVD方法，联合蒸馏空间和时间特征，确保高保真视频生成。

Result: 在MiniUCF和HMDB51数据集上表现优异，仅用少量帧即可达到接近原始数据集的性能。

Conclusion: GVD在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，并能生成更高分辨率的视频。

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAE在掩码策略和分布外数据上的性能依赖问题。

Method: 提出MINR框架，结合隐式神经表示与掩码图像建模，学习连续图像表示函数。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Result: 方法不仅分割精度高，还能生成反映数据分布的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉边界模糊区域的不确定性，提供更可靠的量化结果。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN的自动化临床决策支持框架，用于视网膜疾病的早期检测，结合手工特征和深度学习特征，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工且耗时耗力，需要自动化且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 融合手工HOG特征和CNN特征，构建轻量级可解释模型HOG-CNN。

Result: 在APTOS、ORIGA和IC-AMD数据集上表现优异，如98.5%准确率和99.2 AUC（DR分类）。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是资源有限临床环境中自动化视网膜疾病筛查的强有力工具。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UVOS方法因过度依赖高层语义特征而缺乏细粒度信息，导致性能提升有限。

Method: 提出分层记忆架构，结合浅层和高层特征，并设计异构交互机制（PLAM和SGIM模块）平衡像素和语义信息的利用。

Result: HMHI-Net在UVOS和视频显著性检测基准测试中均达到最先进性能，且在不同骨干网络下表现稳健。

Conclusion: HMHI-Net通过分层记忆和异构交互机制，显著提升了UVOS任务的性能，证明了其优越性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体和身份验证等系统构成威胁，现有检测方法仅关注图像域且缺乏辅助任务，限制了鲁棒性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的零样本能力，提出新型VLM方法，并在包含60,000张图像的高质量数据集上评估。

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，最佳架构InstructBLIP在DFDC-P数据集上优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中优于传统分类器，展示了零样本方法的潜力。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Conclusion: LIDAR网络在多模态裂缝分割任务中高效且性能优越，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Result: 在VGAF-GEMS基准上，GEMS框架在定量和定性比较中表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: GEMS为情绪理解研究提供了新方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有All-in-One模型难以捕捉多样化和局部化的天气退化模式，尤其是在频域操作中表现不佳。

Method: SSGformer利用频谱分解（边缘检测和奇异值分解）提取高低频特征，通过多头部线性注意力建模特征关系，并引入分组掩码和分组注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，SSGformer在多样化和复杂的天气退化条件下表现优越。

Conclusion: SSGformer通过频谱分解和分组注意力机制，有效解决了多天气图像恢复中的局部化和多样化退化问题。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Conclusion: ACTIVE数据集和方法为N-HRI中的动作识别提供了全面且具有挑战性的基准。

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The

Conclusion: 提示演化机制有效提升了任务特定知识的整合能力，显著提高了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Method: 创建异构集成模型COOkeD，结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过简单但有效的异构集成方法，显著提升了OOD检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

TL;DR: LOTS是一种基于草图-文本组合的时尚图像生成方法，通过全局描述和局部草图+文本信息进行条件生成，并采用逐步融合策略优化扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚设计涉及视觉和文本表达的复杂结合，现有方法难以同时处理全局和局部信息。LOTS旨在通过草图-文本对实现更灵活的时尚图像生成。

Method: LOTS采用模块化对中心表示将草图和文本编码到共享潜在空间，并通过扩散对引导阶段在扩散模型中整合局部和全局条件。

Result: LOTS在全局和局部指标上均达到最优性能，并通过定性分析和人类评估验证了其设计定制能力。

Conclusion: LOTS通过草图-文本组合实现了高度定制化的时尚图像生成，为时尚设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代游戏中内容渲染的复杂性增加导致GPU负载过重，需要一种方法将部分工作转移到低功耗设备（如NPU）上。

Method: LCS基于高效超分辨率（ESR）模型，通过对抗训练、重参数化和量化技术降低模型复杂度和大小。

Result: LCS在五项指标上优于AMD的硬件缩放方案（EASF和FSR1），具有更好的感知质量。

Conclusion: LCS展示了ESR模型在资源受限设备上进行图像放大的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Abstract: Leaf wetness detection is a crucial task in agricultural monitoring, as it
directly impacts the prediction and protection of plant diseases. However,
existing sensing systems suffer from limitations in robustness, accuracy, and
environmental resilience when applied to natural leaves under dynamic
real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce a new
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for evaluating and advancing machine
learning algorithms in leaf wetness detection. Our dataset comprises
synchronized mmWave raw data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and RGB
images collected over six months from five diverse plant species in both
controlled and outdoor field environments. We provide detailed benchmarks using
the Hydra model, including comparisons against single modality baselines and
multiple fusion strategies, as well as performance under varying scan
distances. Additionally, our dataset can serve as a benchmark for future SAR
imaging algorithm optimization, enabling a systematic evaluation of detection
accuracy under diverse conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低收入国家因缺乏专业超声医师导致胎儿超声图像质量评估困难的问题。

Method: 基于FetalCLIP预训练模型，采用LoRA方法进行参数高效微调，构建FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$模型，并与CNN和Transformer基线模型对比。

Result: FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$在ACOUSLIC-AI数据集上取得最高F1分数0.757，进一步优化的分割模型达到0.771。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调方法可有效适应特定任务，推动资源有限地区的产前护理发展。

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA是一个新型视觉框架，通过整合多种视觉骨干网络和稀疏专家混合连接器（MoECs）模块，动态提取互补视觉特征，并采用分层组注意力（HGA）优化视觉信息利用，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在训练和推理成本高、跨模态信息融合困难以及视觉细节提取不足等方面存在问题。

Method: MoCHA整合了CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt四种视觉骨干网络，结合MoECs模块动态选择专家，并通过HGA模块优化视觉特征利用。

Result: MoCHA在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在POPE上减少幻觉3.25%，在MME上提升153分，优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块显著提升了性能，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRecover是一种跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或描述），无需图像重建，解决了视觉语言模型中的语义信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分体DNN配置中的部署增加，中间特征的语义信息泄漏风险日益突出，现有图像重建方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，并通过实验验证其性能。同时，提出一种噪声添加与去除的保护方法。

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上生成流畅描述（ROUGE-L达0.52）。保护方法有效防止语义泄漏。

Conclusion: CapRecover能高效恢复语义内容，同时提出的保护方法简单有效，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

### [188] [Dimensions of Vulnerability in Visual Working Memory: An AI-Driven Approach to Perceptual Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22067)
*Yuang Cao,Jiachen Zou,Chen Wei,Quanying Liu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI驱动框架，研究视觉工作记忆中的记忆扭曲，发现视觉维度比语义维度更容易导致记忆失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉工作记忆在认知任务中因感知比较导致的记忆扭曲，以及自然视觉刺激的哪些特征会增加记忆的脆弱性。

Method: 使用AI生成基于行为相关对象维度的自然视觉刺激，通过图像轮和维度轮两种刺激类型，在三种视觉工作记忆实验条件下测试记忆扭曲。

Result: 实验表明，相似维度（如相似图像）会引发记忆扭曲，且视觉维度比语义维度更易失真。

Conclusion: 自然视觉刺激的对象维度对记忆脆弱性有显著影响，视觉维度是记忆扭曲的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: Human memory exhibits significant vulnerability in cognitive tasks and daily
life. Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,
during cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous
studies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual
comparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory
distortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying
what visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel
research question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates
naturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions
to elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --
image wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated
by dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)
experiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three
conditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,
and perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar
dimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.
Specifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic
dimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual
stimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示计算模型中学习到的特征表示可能存在的偏差，以及这些偏差如何影响神经科学中的表示分析。

Method: 通过分析PCA、回归和RSA等常见方法，展示特征表示偏差如何导致推断偏差，并以同态加密为例说明表示与计算之间的分离。

Result: 结果表明，特征表示偏差可能导致对系统的误解，尤其是在比较不同系统的表示时。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要更谨慎地处理表示分析中的偏差，以避免对神经系统的错误理解。

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a
means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural
representations to the internal representations learned by computational
models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that
learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain
features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example,
simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented
than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges
for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis.
In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature
representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common
analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption
as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between
patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of
these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for
neuroscience more generally.

Motivation: 抑郁和自杀倾向对认知和情绪有深远影响，但缺乏客观的神经生理标志物。

Method: 137名参与者完成句子评估任务，记录EEG数据，通过多变量解码分析神经动态。

Result: 抑郁和自杀倾向患者表现出更早、更长、更强的神经反应，且激活了更多脑区。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了抑郁和自杀倾向患者的神经认知异常，为开发EEG标志物提供了基础。

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet
objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the
spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in
individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and
suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally
charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified
robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy
between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation
and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with
depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater
amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization
and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These
findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from
emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding
of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis
for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: TroVE声称通过工具箱方法在MATH基准上优于直接生成代码的PRIMITIVE，但后续分析发现其优势主要源于更高的计算预算，而非工具箱机制本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨TroVE工具箱方法的实际效果，验证其是否真正通过工具箱机制提升性能。

Method: 重新评估TroVE在MATH基准上的表现，分析其三种模式（直接生成代码、创建工具、重用工具）的贡献，并修正其选择机制。

Result: 修正后TroVE性能提升3%，但在匹配计算预算后，优势仅剩1%，表明工具箱方法效果有限。

Conclusion: TroVE的性能提升主要来自更高的计算预算，工具箱方法本身对MATH基准的贡献不大。

Abstract: Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem
solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex
challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language
Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and
reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an
ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and
reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only
performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,
2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often
trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from
self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on
MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does
not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget
spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small
correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,
boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\% in accuracy. After matching for
compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\%,
suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on
MATH.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自主代理在高风险领域（如制药和法律工作流）的普及，可验证性成为关键挑战。

Result: 提出了协议设计、系统需求及在制药研发、法律自动化等领域的用例，支持信任原生的自主系统。

Conclusion: 从云到AI再到代理和信任的过渡，代表了自主系统的下一架构层。

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in
high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge
is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a
protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy
commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent
infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By
treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,
TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and
jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use
cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and
AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust
transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）应用的普及，识别系统漏洞变得尤为重要。自动化红队测试通过LLM生成和执行攻击来加速这一过程，但攻击生成器的评估需要更精确的方法。

Method: 通过重复多次攻击随机种子目标，测量单个攻击的成功期望（可发现性），并利用这些信息优化攻击生成器的提示。

Result: 该方法揭示了可被利用的模式，从而更有效地优化攻击生成器提示，提升评估的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过测量攻击的可发现性，该方法为攻击生成器的优化提供了更可靠的基础，增强了自动化红队测试的效果。

Abstract: Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread,
making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important.
Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and
execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using
the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of
success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing
attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating
each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an
attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This
approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization,
ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Strategic Deflection（SDeflection）的防御方法，通过语义转移而非直接拒绝来应对LLMs的高级攻击，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在关键领域的广泛应用，确保其免受越狱攻击的安全性变得至关重要。传统防御方法主要通过拒绝恶意提示来应对，但最新的攻击手段已能绕过这些防御。

Method: SDeflection方法通过让模型生成与用户请求语义相邻但去除有害意图的答案，来中和攻击者的恶意目的。

Result: 实验表明，SDeflection显著降低了攻击成功率（ASR），同时不影响模型在良性查询上的性能。

Conclusion: SDeflection代表了一种防御策略的关键转变，从简单拒绝转向战略内容转移，以中和高级威胁。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas,
ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While
traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent
logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by
directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We
introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the
LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model
produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet
strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful
intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers
Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign
queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving
from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced
threats.

Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field
of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct
manipulations of harmful intent, with limited attention to the impact of
persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of
persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic
algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass
LLM's safety mechanisms. Our experiments reveal that: (1) our evolved persona
prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% across multiple LLMs, and (2) these
prompts demonstrate synergistic effects when combined with existing attack
methods, increasing success rates by 10-20%. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational
efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC)
systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown
promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator
trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that
integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language
explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as
LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s
inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs,
including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate
human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o
mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack
target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and
2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These
results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time
detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical
need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

Conclusion: SAEL通过结合LLMs的适应性和专家混合架构的动态调整，实现了更高效的智能合约漏洞检测。

Abstract: With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract
vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability
detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle
with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models
perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.
In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they
often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on
specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by
general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,
contributing to improved detection performance.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for
smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to
guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which
serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to
process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To
combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive
Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a
Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and
Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism
to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective
integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through
gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent
feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that
SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了Android权限的保护级别和废弃/受限权限对概念漂移的影响，需填补这一空白。

Method: 使用包含16.6万权限的大数据集，结合多种机器学习和深度学习算法，以及概念漂移检测策略。

Result: 废弃和受限权限的排除对模型性能影响较小，CNN准确性提升，数据集平衡进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: Android权限是有效的恶意软件检测特征，排除废弃和受限权限有助于概念漂移检测。

Abstract: Permission analysis is a widely used method for Android malware detection. It
involves examining the permissions requested by an application to access
sensitive data or perform potentially malicious actions. In recent years,
various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to Android malware
detection using permission-based features and feature selection techniques,
often achieving high accuracy. However, these studies have largely overlooked
important factors such as protection levels and the deprecation or restriction
of permissions due to updates in the Android OS -- factors that can contribute
to concept drift.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of deprecated and restricted
permissions on the performance of machine learning models. A large dataset
containing 166 permissions was used, encompassing more than 70,000 malware and
benign applications. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were
employed as classifiers, along with different concept drift detection
strategies. The results suggest that Android permissions are highly effective
features for malware detection, with the exclusion of deprecated and restricted
permissions having only a marginal impact on model performance. In some cases,
such as with CNN, accuracy improved. Excluding these permissions also enhanced
the detection of concept drift using a year-to-year analysis strategy. Dataset
balancing further improved model performance, reduced low-accuracy instances,
and enhanced concept drift detection via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

TL;DR: 论文提出DeCoda框架，结合LLM去混淆与代码图学习，显著提升恶意JavaScript代码检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意JavaScript代码威胁用户隐私和系统安全，但现有方法因代码混淆和语言特性难以检测。

Method: DeCoda框架：1) LLM多阶段去混淆生成AST；2) 通过Cluster-wise Graph学习层次代码图表示。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上F1-score达94.64%和97.71%，优于基线10.74%和13.85%。

Conclusion: LLM去混淆和集群级关系建模对恶意代码检测有效。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services,
malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user
privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats
remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and
JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure
structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid
defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation
with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated
prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM
progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs
and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2)
In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while
deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise
and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn
hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that
synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and
node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level
semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64%
and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of
10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control
evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers
4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing
baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation
and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in
detecting malicious code.

Abstract: Despite outstanding results, machine learning-based Android malware detection
models struggle with concept drift, where rapidly evolving malware
characteristics degrade model effectiveness. This study examines the impact of
concept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine
machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models
(LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and
image-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is
widespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the
drift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.
Balancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address
concept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware
landscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and
concept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables
since hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm
configurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated
promising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,
highlighting the need for further investigation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟在线不安全对话，并通过用户反馈提升学习效果，以促进网络安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（如LLMs）降低了不良行为者创建不安全对话的门槛，因此需要探索提升在线安全的方法。

Method: 通过两个LLM模拟诈骗对话（骗子LLM和目标LLM），并让用户为目标LLM提供反馈。

Result: 模拟出逼真的不安全对话，用户反馈机制有助于提升对不安全对话的识别能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM模拟和用户反馈是提升在线安全的一种有效方法。

Abstract: Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) have the potential --
and already are being used -- to increase the speed, scale, and types of unsafe
conversations online. LLMs lower the barrier for entry for bad actors to create
unsafe conversations in particular because of their ability to generate
persuasive and human-like text. In our current work, we explore ways to promote
online safety by teaching people about unsafe conversations that can occur
online with and without LLMs. We build on prior work that shows that LLMs can
successfully simulate scam conversations. We also leverage research in the
learning sciences that shows that providing feedback on one's hypothetical
actions can promote learning. In particular, we focus on simulating scam
conversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with
each other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may
encounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system
are asked provide feedback to the target LLM.

Motivation: 许多人在线自学编程时感到孤立和沮丧，面临信息过载和缺乏指导的问题。社交媒体上的自我调节实践启发了这一研究。

Method: 开发了一个包含网页平台和浏览器扩展的系统，利用AI生成反馈，将学习活动转化为故事。招募了15名学习者进行测试。

Conclusion: 系统展示了AI增强自我调节工具的潜力，但也指出了改进空间和未来设计机会。

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Result: 在汽车和航空领域的案例研究中，生成了具有严格无限时间范围安全保证的高效神经网络实现。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络控制系统提供了从理论到实际实现的完整解决方案，确保了其在有限精度扰动下的安全性。

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical
neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing
their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured
throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon
verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent
approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based
guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for
roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper
bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations
by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,
actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the
problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,
and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal
proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this
bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to
synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete
end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the
automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with
rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音生物识别系统的普及增加了隐私风险，现有方法无法有效处理音频数据的时序性和高维性，需要一种新的遗忘方法。

Method: 采用量子启发的四阶段方法：权重初始化、叠加标签变换、量子损失函数和权重混合。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上验证，QPAudioEraser实现了目标数据的完全擦除（0%遗忘准确率），且对模型性能影响极小（仅0.05%下降）。

Conclusion: QPAudioEraser是一种高效的隐私保护解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric
systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with
sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right
to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient
erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric
models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately
handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals,
leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address
this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning
framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using
destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based
label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an
uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired
mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech
Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate
QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure
of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model
utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%.
QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across
single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios,
establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.

Conclusion: Dragon-FM通过统一AR和流匹配，解决了现有模型的局限性，适用于长内容生成。

Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced
generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which
rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow
generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)
caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel
text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model
processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per
second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global
coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast
iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache
across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it
bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous
AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers.
This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the
proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content.
Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its
capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Conclusion: 所提出的时长预测框架显著提升了语音到文本对齐的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech
(TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to
learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle
and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading
to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models
rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration
models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction
framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with
given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise
prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline
models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment
accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the
mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned
Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats:
multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that
fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram
questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to
generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its
potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials

future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally
demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel
physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model
(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor
of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM
is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and
conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard
conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of
SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust
generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,
our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE
for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming
interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,
we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial
scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System
Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to
directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution
climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be
readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve
projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and
potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.
