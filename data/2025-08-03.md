### [1] [Large Language Models in the Travel Domain: An Industrial Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22910)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在线房产预订平台中第三方数据源的不一致问题，通过集成大语言模型（LLMs）提升数据一致性。Mixtral 8x7B表现优于Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决第三方数据源的不完整和不一致问题，提升用户体验和市场竞争力。

Method: 在CALEIDOHOTELS平台上评估Mistral 7B（QLoRA微调）和Mixtral 8x7B（优化系统提示）的性能。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6%）、精确度（98.8%）和幻觉率（1.2%）上表现更好，但计算成本显著更高。

Conclusion: 研究为生产环境中LLM的部署提供了质量与资源效率的权衡指导，证明了LLM在提升数据一致性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

### [2] [ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22911)
*Jinzhi Wang,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Qinfeng Song,Kaixuan Yang,Jiangbo Zhang,Yaoying Wang,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ElectriQ是一个专为电力营销场景设计的基准测试，用于评估和提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的表现。它包含对话数据集和四个评估指标，并通过知识增强方法提升模型性能。实验显示，经过优化的较小模型可以超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力营销客服系统（如95598热线）存在响应慢、流程僵化等问题，通用LLMs缺乏领域专业性和同理心。ElectriQ旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含六类服务场景的对话数据集，设计四项评估指标，并引入领域知识库和知识增强方法。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的小型模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为开发适合电力营销服务的LLMs提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合微调语言模型和半监督集成学习的层次分类框架，用于检测和分类非法市场内容，在多平台数据上表现优于多个基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法市场转向隐蔽的互联网渠道，如暗网和Telegram等，检测和分类此类内容面临数据标签不足、语言演变和平台异构性等挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段分类框架：第一阶段使用半监督集成学习检测销售相关文档；第二阶段进一步分类为毒品、武器或凭证销售。结合ModernBERT语义表示和手工特征。

Result: 模型在三个数据集上表现优异，准确率达0.96489，F1分数0.93467，TMCC为0.95388，优于BERT、DarkBERT等基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架在有限监督下表现出强泛化能力和鲁棒性，适用于现实世界的非法内容检测。

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [4] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合嵌入式机器学习模型与大语言模型（LLM）的混合框架，用于图书馆主题分析，以提高预测准确性和减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主题分析是图书馆管理系统的核心功能，传统机器学习模型在处理未见案例时表现不佳，而LLM虽能提供替代方案，但存在过度生成和幻觉问题。

Method: 通过嵌入式ML模型预测最优标签数量以指导LLM生成，并对预测结果进行后编辑以对齐实际主题词（LCSH）。

Result: 实验表明，混合框架能生成更受控且与词汇表对齐的主题词预测。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了ML和LLM的优势，显著提升了主题分析的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [5] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的知识图谱集成方法，结合标签匹配和三重匹配，解决了上下文匹配的不足，并在多样测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱集成方法在上下文匹配方面不足，尤其是在处理来源、规模和密度差异大的图谱时效果不佳。

Method: 采用字符串操作、模糊匹配和向量相似度技术对齐标签，并通过三重匹配提升实体匹配准确性。

Result: 在OAEI竞赛中表现优异，优于监督方法，且在多样测试中达到高准确率。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了知识图谱集成中的上下文匹配问题，并提供了更全面的评估数据集。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉现象进行了系统研究，包括定义、理论分析、检测与缓解策略，并提出统一的评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs生成内容与输入或事实不符的问题，为幻觉现象提供理论基础和实践指导。

Method: 区分内在与外在幻觉，定义幻觉风险并推导其边界；提出检测策略（如不确定性估计）和缓解方法（如检索增强生成）。

Result: 建立了幻觉的理论框架，并提出统一的检测与缓解流程及评估协议。

Conclusion: 为LLMs中的幻觉问题提供了理论支持和实用解决方案，有助于减少模型生成的不准确内容。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [7] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，通过引入时间逻辑处理纵向查询，显著提升了答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在跟踪跨时间实体和现象时存在缺陷，需要一种能同时满足主题相关性和时间连贯性的方法。

Method: 将查询分解为主题和时间窗口，使用专门检索器平衡语义匹配与时间相关性，确保证据集的连续性。

Result: 在ADQAB基准测试中，新方法比标准RAG实现准确率提升13%至27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统提供了处理复杂现实问题的有效途径，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Gemma-2语言模型（2B和9B规模）的特征普适性，发现尽管规模差异显著，模型仍收敛于相似内部概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同规模的语言模型是否在内部概念上具有一致性，为跨模型可解释性提供基础。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取残差流激活，通过激活相关性对齐特征，并用SVCCA和RSA比较特征空间。

Result: 中间层特征重叠最强，早期和晚期层相似性较低；多令牌子空间分析显示语义相似子空间与模型交互方式一致。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在不同规模下仍能形成相似的可解释特征，支持特征普适性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [9] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种预测模型，用于临床试验中严重不良事件（SAE）的预测，利用注册信息优化试验设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，优化临床试验设计，减少试验终止和不必要的风险暴露。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）进行特征提取，结合滑动窗口方法处理长文本，开发分类和回归模型。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在预测SAE比例时AUC为77.6%，RMSE为18.6%，滑动窗口方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: ClinicalTrials.gov的数据未充分利用，预测模型可改进试验设计并发现预期与实际结果的差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

TL;DR: 该论文填补了关于离散标记化方法在大型语言模型（LLM）中应用的全面调查空白，提出了一个结构化分类法，分析了8种代表性的向量量化（VQ）变体，并探讨了其与LLM集成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，需要将连续多模态数据转换为适合语言处理的离散表示。然而，缺乏对向量量化技术在LLM中应用的系统性调查。

Method: 论文提出了首个结构化分类法，分析了8种代表性的VQ变体，涵盖经典和现代范式，并探讨了其算法原理、训练动态及与LLM集成的挑战。

Result: 研究总结了量化策略对对齐、推理和生成性能的影响，并识别了代码本崩溃、梯度估计不稳定等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 该调查为高效、可泛化的多模态系统开发提供了基础参考，并提出了动态量化、统一标记化框架等新兴研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A
continuously updated version is available at:

### [11] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为语言模型链（LMC）的算法，通过多阶段级联的语言模型组合，显著提高了预测速度和准确性，同时减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型成本高、易产生幻觉信息以及资源浪费的问题。

Method: 提出并实现LMC算法，通过验证候选答案的正确性，逐步使用更慢但更准确的语言模型进行修正。

Result: 在医疗文档中提取患者出生日期的实验中，LMC显著提升了速度和准确性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: LMC算法对知识提取领域有重要贡献，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

### [12] [Multi-Relation Extraction in Entity Pairs using Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22926)
*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的输入嵌入方法，用于文档级关系抽取，通过全局上下文和多句子推理提升关系预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注实体出现的句子，无法捕捉完整的文档上下文，导致关系抽取不准确。

Method: 引入一种新的输入嵌入方法，将实体表示为独立片段，而非仅关注其出现位置，以利用全局关系和多句子推理。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL三个基准数据集上测试，结果显示方法能准确预测文档级实体关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论上推动了全局上下文建模和多句子推理，实践上提升了关系检测性能，适用于需要全面实体洞察的NLP应用。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨社交媒体情绪对股价的预测能力，发现其相关性较弱，而评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究社交媒体情绪（如Reddit的r/wallstreetbets）是否对股价有显著影响。

Method: 使用两种现有情感分析方法，并引入基于ChatGPT标注和RoBERTa的模型，分析GameStop和AMC的讨论。

Result: 社交媒体情绪与股价相关性较弱，评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。

Conclusion: 传统情感分析可能无法完全捕捉在线讨论对市场的影响，零售投资者行为复杂。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言检索增强生成（RAG）系统中提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响，发现优化策略可显著提升跨语言知识共享和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上有进步，但其在不同语言和任务中的表现差异显著。多语言RAG系统中，知识库（KB）常从高资源语言共享到低资源语言，导致检索信息与上下文语言不一致，而提示翻译策略的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估了多语言RAG系统中不同提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响，比较了预翻译和跨语言提示两种常见方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的提示策略能显著提升跨语言知识共享，从而改善下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究主张在多语言资源（尤其是低资源语言）共享和跨语言提示优化中更广泛地应用这些策略。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM依赖参数化知识，缺乏可解释性和可信度；传统TOD系统需要手动标注或监督训练构建本体，效率低。

Method: 结合LLM的SQL编程能力和对话理论，无监督地构建任务导向对话本体。

Result: TeQoDO在对话状态跟踪任务中表现优于迁移学习方法，且能扩展构建更大规模的本体。

Conclusion: TeQoDO为提升LLM的可解释性提供了新思路，展示了本体在LLM中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在美在线计算机课程中，英语母语与非母语学生对同伴反馈体验的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着国际学生比例增加，研究语言背景对在线课程中同伴反馈体验的影响。

Method: 使用Twitter-roBERTa模型分析500名学生的同伴反馈情感，结合语言背景进行统计。

Result: 英语母语学生对反馈评价较低，非母语学生反馈更积极但收到反馈情感较低。

Conclusion: 语言背景在同伴反馈体验中扮演复杂但适度的角色。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

TL;DR: MRGSEM-Sum提出了一种基于多关系图和结构熵最小化的无监督多文档摘要框架，解决了现有方法在关系建模和自适应聚类上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档摘要的核心挑战是文档间关系的复杂性和信息冗余。现有方法通常仅考虑单关系图且需预定义聚类数量，限制了其性能。

Method: 构建多关系图整合句子间的语义和篇章关系，应用二维结构熵最小化算法进行自适应聚类，最后通过位置感知压缩机制生成摘要。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有无监督方法，部分情况下接近监督模型和大语言模型的性能，人工评估显示摘要质量接近人类水平。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum通过多关系图和结构熵最小化有效解决了多文档摘要的挑战，生成高质量摘要。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆存储与检索方法在结构化组织和高效检索方面存在不足，影响了LLM智能体的决策能力和上下文连贯性。

Method: 采用分层记忆架构，按语义抽象程度组织记忆，并通过索引路由机制实现逐层高效检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务中，H-MEM方法均优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: H-MEM架构有效提升了LLM智能体的长期记忆能力，适用于长期对话场景。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注RAG系统整体性能，缺乏对LLM特定能力的系统性和细粒度评估，特别是在文档利用方面的能力。

Method: 提出多层级细粒度基准测试，包括多级过滤能力、组合能力和参考推理能力，并采用基于占位符的创新方法分离LLM参数化知识和外部知识的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，代表性LLM在RAG系统中的生成能力存在局限性，尤其是在错误恢复和上下文忠实度方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过特征级因果分析验证了Chain-of-thought (CoT)提示在大型语言模型中的真实性，发现其在2.8B模型中显著提升答案准确性，但在70M模型中无效，揭示了规模阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨CoT生成的“思考”是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，从Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B模型中提取单义特征，分析其在GSM8K数学问题中的表现。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，CoT显著提升答案对数概率，激活稀疏性和特征可解释性更高，表明模块化计算；70M模型无显著效果。

Conclusion: CoT在高容量LLMs中能诱导更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中潜力巨大，但受限于幻觉问题，如知识不足、视觉定位和推理能力不足，以及多模态数据稀缺，影响了精确诊断。现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段的多代理框架（知识检索、任务案例研究和结果验证）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Motivation: 社交平台上用户自我披露PII存在隐私风险，但缺乏开源标注数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 开发了一种生成合成PII揭示数据的方法，使用三种LLM生成数据，并通过三种指标评估其效用。

Result: 生成了一个合成PII标注数据集，并验证了其与原始数据的可重复性、不可链接性和不可区分性。

Conclusion: 该方法为在线社交媒体中的PII隐私风险研究提供了可重复的数据支持。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定压缩率，无法适应不同复杂度的查询，导致效率或准确性损失。

Method: 结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，动态调整压缩率，保留最小充分信息。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ACC-RAG优于固定压缩率方法，推理速度提升4倍以上，且准确性不降。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG通过动态压缩率显著提升了RAG的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information

case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the

prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种协作专家框架（CoE-Ops），结合通用大型语言模型任务分类器，以解决AIOps中的多任务挑战，并通过实验验证其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIOps模型受限于领域知识，只能处理特定任务，而多模型协作在提升效率方面已被证明有效。本文旨在解决类似挑战。

Method: 提出CoE-Ops框架，引入检索增强生成机制，支持高低级别任务处理，并在DevOps-EVAL数据集上进行实验。

Result: CoE-Ops在高级别任务路由准确率上提升72%，在DevOps问题解决中比单一模型准确率提高8%，且优于大规模MoE模型14%。

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架有效解决了AIOps中的多任务挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Abstract: Hallucinations are often inevitable in downstream tasks using large language
models (LLMs). To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations
for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from seven TBox datasets in the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of
ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的流程图图表示与文本检索增强生成（RAG）系统的方法，用于解决技术文档中基于图像的问答问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术文档中的问答常涉及图表内容，传统文本RAG系统无法有效处理此类问题。

Method: 利用VLM生成流程图的图表示，并将其整合到文本RAG系统中，实现图像检索。方法包括文档处理、图像分类、图表示构建及与文本嵌入管道的结合。

Result: 实验表明，基于微调VLM生成的图表示与真实值编辑距离更小，检索性能良好，且无需在推理阶段使用VLM，降低成本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了基于流程图的问答性能，同时降低了部署成本。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

TL;DR: RELIANCE是一个新框架，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在中间推理步骤中存在的事实错误问题，通过事实检查、强化学习和机制解释模块提升事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在中间推理步骤中的事实错误可能在高风险领域（如医疗、法律和科研）导致误导性决策，亟需提升事实准确性。

Method: RELIANCE整合了三个核心组件：事实检查分类器、GRPO强化学习方法以及机制解释模块。

Result: 实验显示，RELIANCE显著提升了事实准确性（最高49.90%），并在多个基准测试中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: RELIANCE为未来通过激活引导优化提升事实鲁棒性的训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

TL;DR: SigBERT是一种创新的时序生存分析框架，通过处理电子医疗报告中的文本数据，结合签名提取和LASSO-Cox模型，显著提升了生存分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存分析方法难以有效处理文本数据的复杂性，尤其是时序形式的临床报告。

Method: SigBERT提取并平均词嵌入为句子嵌入，利用粗糙路径理论提取签名特征，结合LASSO-Cox模型估计风险评分。

Result: 在真实肿瘤数据集上测试，C-index得分为0.75（标准差0.014）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序医疗数据，提升了基于叙事的生存分析能力。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过验证基于代码算法的测量特性，可以提高大型索赔数据库分析的可靠性，但传统方法耗时耗力。

Method: 使用NLP减少人工审查时间，并结合多波自适应采样和预定义停止规则，提高效率。

Result: NLP辅助审查使每份图表审查时间减少40%，多波采样方法可减少77%的图表审查，且不影响测量精度。

Conclusion: 该方法可促进更常规的算法验证，增强数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Motivation: 传统批判将任意性与不公正混为一谈，本文旨在揭示其作为系统有效运行的基础功能。

Method: 基于索绪尔的符号任意性理论，扩展到法律和社会动态，提出“动机→可观察性→可争议性”链，并结合香农熵模型形式化任意性。

Result: 任意性通过“动机缺失”或“冲突侧化”机制保护权威免受问责，同时为控制与关怀提供中性操作框架。

Conclusion: 任意性不仅是系统设计的核心，也为人工智能可解释性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Result: 数据集和评估方法为全面探索SDMs在解决语音交互中的模糊性和上下文依赖性等挑战提供了工具。

Conclusion: 论文通过数据集和评估方法填补了SDMs研究中的空白，为未来SDMs的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Method: 构建由人类专家标注的Math NLI数据集，并对比LLMs生成假设的效果，分析其性能和一致性。

Result: LLMs在某些场景下表现接近人类标注，但在数学语言推理上仍有困难，偶尔连基本推理也会失败。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI任务中有潜力，但仍需改进数学语言理解能力。数据集公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

Result: 在暴力事件相关子集上，FI和FSRL的F1分数分别达到94.3%和77.4%。

Conclusion: ICL为领域特定FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

Motivation: RoPE依赖静态频率模式，无法建模上下文敏感关系，CARoPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CARoPE通过有界变换生成输入依赖的相位偏移，动态调整旋转机制。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE显著降低困惑度，训练效率更高。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了一种可扩展、高效的位置编码升级方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）处理中文文本歧义时的表现，发现其存在显著脆弱性，与人类行为差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在遇到歧义文本时的可信度，尤其是中文文本歧义问题。

Method: 创建包含歧义句子及其消歧对的基准数据集，分为3大类9小类，并通过实验分析LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs无法可靠区分歧义文本，倾向于过度自信地解释为单一含义，且在理解多种可能含义时表现出过度思考。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理语言歧义时存在根本性局限，需改进语言理解中的不确定性处理方法。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub
repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

*Ananya Sadana,Yash Kumar Lal,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ISO-Bench是一个评估多模态模型因果推理能力的基准，测试模型是否能判断视觉步骤与文本步骤的先后顺序。当前前沿模型表现不佳，最佳零样本F1仅为0.57，人类表现则为0.98。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解跨模态的因果关系是多模态模型在真实环境中的核心挑战，需要开发更有效的评估工具。

Method: 通过图像和文本片段配对，要求模型判断视觉步骤与文本步骤的先后顺序，评估其因果推理能力。

Result: 十种前沿视觉语言模型表现较差，零样本F1最高0.57，链式推理略有提升（至0.62），远低于人类（0.98）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态模型在因果理解上的不足，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究从用户与语言模型交互日志中提取隐式用户反馈的潜力与局限性，发现反馈内容（而非仅极性）能提升模型在简单任务上的表现，但其效果依赖于用户初始提示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不直接打扰用户的情况下，通过隐式反馈持续优化语言模型。

Method: 分析WildChat和LMSYS数据集中的用户反馈，研究其发生时机、原因及学习信号的提取效果。

Result: 隐式反馈内容（如用户需要澄清）能提升模型在简单任务（MTBench）上的表现，但对复杂任务（WildBench）无效；反馈效果与用户初始提示质量相关。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈在特定场景下具有潜力，但其应用受限于任务复杂性和用户输入质量。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

TL;DR: LENS提出了一种基于内部表示学习模型置信度的方法，通过分析隐藏状态和概率来动态加权多个LLM的预测，显著优于传统集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法（如投票或对数集成）忽略了模型在不同上下文中的置信度和可靠性差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: LENS为每个LLM训练轻量级线性置信预测器，利用层间隐藏状态和归一化概率作为输入，动态调整模型权重。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务中，LENS显著优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为模型置信度提供了有效信号，可成功用于集成学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化低层内核开发以满足性能和生产力需求变得至关重要。

Method: GEAK利用推理时计算缩放和Reflexion式反馈机制，生成针对AMD GPU（如MI300X和MI250）的Triton代码。

Result: GEAK在正确性上达到63%，执行速度提升2.59倍，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了代理式代码生成在加速硬件平台采用和普及专家级内核性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注正样本，忽略了负样本在上下文学习中的潜在价值。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本库，通过语义相似性选择正负样本，并进一步优化正样本选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖正样本的方法，验证了负样本信息的有效性。

Conclusion: 负样本信息有助于通过优化正样本选择提升ICL性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

TL;DR: MTMs是一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的主题模型，能够捕捉更深层次的语义特征，并通过主题引导向量实现可控文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征，而神经变体虽使用更丰富的表示，但仍受限于主题表达为词列表。

Method: MTMs利用稀疏自编码器学习可解释特征，并在这一语义丰富的空间中定义主题，同时引入基于LLM的评估框架topic judge。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统和神经基线相当或更优，且更受topic judge偏好，还能有效引导LLM输出。

Conclusion: MTMs通过可解释特征和可控生成能力，显著提升了主题模型的表达能力和实用性。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期准确诊断需要分析多种异构生物标志物，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理结构化数据方面具有潜力。

Method: 采用TableGPT2模型，通过少量样本构建提示并进行微调，用于AD与认知正常（CN）的二元分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT在结构化生物标志物数据预测任务中表现优于通用LLMs和专用表格基础模型（TFM）。

Conclusion: TAP-GPT是首个将LLMs应用于表格生物标志物数据预测的框架，为生物医学信息学中的多智能体框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Result: Mistral和Qwen在语用推理任务中表现优异；Claude-3.5-haiku在心理健康污名处理上更负责任。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升推理能力和减少污名化。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly

Result: SEs在模型推理中起关键作用，修剪SEs会导致性能显著下降，尤其是在数学推理任务中。

Conclusion: SEs是MoE模型中的关键组成部分，其存在对模型的注意力分配和性能至关重要。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Result: GPT-4o-mini能系统性降低敏感内容，减少贬义和禁忌语言，且在零样本分类中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM具有隐性审查能力，能有效净化语言，同时零样本分类表现优异。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

Motivation: 现有基准无法直接评估多模态真实世界规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束。MPCC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MPCC通过三个真实任务（飞行、日历、会议规划）和复杂约束（预算、时间、空间）评估MLLMs，并设置难度等级。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅21.3%生成可行计划，开源模型平均低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供了严格评估框架，揭示了约束感知推理的改进需求。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在去除因果注意力掩码或依赖额外输入文本时，可能削弱模型语义提取能力或增加计算开销。

Method: 使用轻量级BERT风格模型预编码输入文本为上下文标记，并将其前置到LLM输入序列中；优化池化策略以减少近期偏差。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到最先进性能，序列长度减少85%，推理时间降低82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在不改变LLM架构或显著增加计算成本的情况下，显著提升了嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Method: 评估三种开源模型在CPU平台上的性能，并与商业在线聊天机器人对比，关注功能性能而非翻译质量。

Result: 本地部署虽具挑战，但能增强数据控制、隐私保护并减少对云服务的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究支持AI技术民主化，为未来开发更广泛适用的语言模型提供参考，尤其针对个体译者和小企业。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对阿拉伯语的增强型密集段落检索（DPR）框架，通过新颖的注意力相关评分（ARS）和预训练语言模型，显著提升了阿拉伯语问答的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语因其复杂的形态、可选变音符号以及现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言的共存，对自然语言处理（NLP）和信息检索（IR）提出了挑战。尽管阿拉伯语全球重要性日益增长，但在NLP研究和基准资源中仍代表性不足。

Method: 提出了一种增强型密集段落检索（DPR）框架，核心是新颖的注意力相关评分（ARS），替代标准交互机制，更有效地建模问题与段落之间的语义相关性。结合预训练阿拉伯语语言模型和架构优化。

Result: 显著提升了阿拉伯语问答的检索性能和排名准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为阿拉伯语NLP提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动批判性思维范式，要求AI模型主动寻求缺失或澄清信息以更好地解决用户查询，并通过GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个新基准评估该能力。实验表明，强化学习能显著提升模型在此任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注被动批判性思维（模型仅拒绝问题查询），而主动批判性思维能更有效地帮助用户解决问题。

Method: 提出主动批判性思维范式，并基于GSM8K设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个基准，测试模型在信息缺失或误导条件下的数学推理能力。通过强化学习算法提升模型表现。

Result: 实验显示，传统模型在主动批判性思维任务上表现不佳，但强化学习显著提升了Qwen3-1.7B的准确率（从0.15%到73.98%）。

Conclusion: 主动批判性思维能提升AI与用户协作解决问题的能力，强化学习是实现这一目标的有效方法。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过微调大语言模型（LLMs）来生成基于用户角色的响应，以满足企业环境中角色特定访问控制的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法通常假设统一访问权限，未解决角色特定访问限制问题，因此需要研究如何让LLMs适应不同角色的权限。

Method: 探索了三种建模策略：基于BERT的分类器、基于LLM的分类器，以及角色条件生成。构建了两个数据集进行评估。

Result: 评估了模型在不同组织结构和对抗性攻击（如提示注入、角色不匹配和越狱尝试）下的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs可以通过微调实现角色特定的响应生成，但需进一步优化以应对复杂场景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个临床安全-有效性双轨基准（CSEDB），用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在临床决策支持中的表现。测试结果显示，领域专用医学LLM表现优于通用模型，但在高风险场景中性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在临床决策支持中的安全性和有效性，为其在医疗环境中的部署提供标准化指标。

Method: 基于临床专家共识，开发了包含30项多维标准的CSEDB框架，并通过2069个开放式Q&A项目测试了6个LLM的性能。

Result: LLM整体表现中等（平均总分57.2%），高风险场景性能下降13.3%。领域专用模型在安全性和有效性上表现更优。

Conclusion: CSEDB为医学LLM的临床评估提供了标准化工具，有助于识别风险和改进方向，促进其在医疗环境中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

Motivation: 现有研究多孤立优化检索或推理能力，缺乏联合优化，且监督微调易导致模型记忆固定路径，泛化能力受限。医学领域的需求未在奖励函数设计中充分体现。

Method: 提出Med-R³框架，分阶段优化推理能力、检索能力及两者的协调，利用渐进式强化学习实现联合优化。

Result: 实验显示Med-R³显著提升性能，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R³超越GPT-4o-mini 3.93%，Qwen2.5-14B + Med-R³提升13.53%。

Conclusion: Med-R³通过联合优化检索与推理，解决了医学领域中的关键挑战，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为T-Detect的新方法，用于检测机器生成的文本，特别是对抗性扰动文本。该方法基于t分布设计，优于传统高斯假设的检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本检测器依赖高斯分布假设，无法有效处理对抗性或非英语文本的厚尾统计特性。

Method: T-Detect使用t分布的厚尾差异分数替代高斯归一化，通过归一化段落对数似然计算检测分数。

Result: 在RAID和HART数据集上，T-Detect性能优于基线，AUROC提升达3.9%，在CT框架中达到0.926的AUROC。

Conclusion: T-Detect为文本检测提供了新的理论基础，展示了更强的鲁棒性，并在对抗条件下表现优异。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Transformer模型的性能，通过差分注意力机制消除噪声，同时保持参数高效性。

Method: 在正负注意力项上应用低秩适配器（LoRA），结合差分注意力机制。

Result: 在大多数任务中表现不如其他参数高效微调方法，但在某些领域（如HumanEval）显著优于LoRA（+11分）。

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在特定任务中表现突出，但需进一步分析注意力模式以优化其泛化能力。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Motivation: 社交媒体中仇恨言论的识别与清理日益重要，尤其是在阿拉伯语文本中。

Method: 采用深度学习和Transformer模型进行仇恨言论检测，将清理任务视为机器翻译问题。

Result: 检测任务达到92%的Macro F1分数和95%的准确率；清理任务BLEU分数为0.3。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在仇恨言论检测和清理任务中表现优异，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

Motivation: 提升知识图谱的完整性和推理能力，同时帮助人类理解复杂的逻辑规则。

Method: 使用AMIE 3.5.1算法从FB15k-237等数据集中提取逻辑规则，并尝试多种提示策略生成解释。

Result: 生成的解释在正确性和清晰度上表现良好，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成逻辑规则解释方面具有潜力，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Motivation: 现有QA基准性能评估LLM的间接性不足，需更直接评估其问题解决能力。

Method: 采用级联问题披露方法，分阶段揭示问题信息，以激发LLM的泛化推理能力。

Result: 该方法不仅改进了LLM间的比较，还生成了更好的中间推理痕迹，缩小了标准QA评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 级联问题披露框架更准确评估LLM能力，表明标准QA评估可能高估模型间性能差异。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to

analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,

Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance

transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力提升与社会偏见缓解之间的相互作用，解决两者是否必然存在权衡的问题。

Method: 比较三种去偏策略（监督微调、知识蒸馏、基于规则的强化学习），并在不同比例的训练样本下测试推理与偏见的权衡。

Result: 发现1:4的混合训练比例（强化学习方法）能显著减少偏见（10%）同时保留大部分推理准确性（88%）。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡MLLMs的公平性与能力提供了具体指导，强化学习是有效的去偏方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 设计了包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，评估了包括GPT-4和Whisper在内的先进音频模型。

Result: AI模型平均准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI架构缺乏人类听觉场景分析的基本机制，呼吁整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [73] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出并形式化定义了‘论证一致性’属性，要求预测者的推理与预测一致。通过实验验证，过滤不一致预测能提高人类和LLM预测的准确性，但用户实验表明用户通常不遵循这一属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证一致性在判断性预测中的价值，尤其是在人类和LLM预测中。

Method: 定义论证一致性，并通过人类和LLM预测实验及用户实验验证其影响。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高准确性，但用户通常不遵循一致性。

Conclusion: 论证一致性对预测准确性有实际价值，需在群体预测中过滤不一致意见。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [74] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了基于Shapley值的责任度量（WSMS）在ontology-mediated查询回答中的计算复杂性，发现其在某些查询类中具有多项式数据复杂度，而在其他情况下则表现出计算困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中各事实的贡献，并探索WSMS度量在不同查询和本体语言中的计算复杂性。

Method: 利用数据库中的结果分析WSMS度量的数据复杂性和组合复杂性，并针对特定查询类进行结构限制以提升计算效率。

Result: 在first-order-rewritable查询类中WSMS具有多项式数据复杂度，但在某些情况下（如支持合取的本体语言）计算困难。DL-Lite方言中部分查询类可实现高效计算。

Conclusion: WSMS度量的计算复杂性依赖于查询和本体语言的结构，通过合理限制查询结构可实现高效计算。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分治法的混合MILP方法，通过新型的ReLU评分（SAS）和全局评分（GS）选择关键变量，显著减少了二进制变量数量并提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法在ReLU变量选择上效率不足，需要更优的变量选择策略以提高验证效率。

Method: 结合分治法，提出SAS和GS两种ReLU评分方法，并与混合MILP（α,β-CROWN和部分MILP）结合使用。

Result: SAS将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，验证效率提升40%，未解决实例比例降至8-15%，平均运行时间保持在46s-417s。

Conclusion: SAS和混合MILP方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了验证效率，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway

we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender

we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Result: 新方法在Corr2Cause基准测试中表现优异，性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 先进的推理模型结合结构化框架能显著提升因果发现能力，为跨领域应用提供通用方案。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上有不同模式，算法高效（平均6秒/图像）且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式化严谨性和黑盒适用性，为图像分类器提供高效且通用的解释方法。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Result: 实验证明该方法实现了资源高效的信任评估，平衡了开销与准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了分布式协作中的资源利用率和任务执行效率。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过策略引导显著提升了记忆回忆性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

Method: 利用Infocom互动小说游戏作为测试平台，要求AI代理在无外部工具的情况下进行自主问题解决，模拟真实世界的复杂挑战。

Result: TextQuests提供了一个有效的测试环境，能够评估AI代理在长期上下文推理和自主问题解决方面的能力。

Conclusion: TextQuests为开发更具鲁棒性的AI代理提供了重要工具，推动了长期推理能力的研究。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: Seed-Prover是一种基于Lean反馈和自总结的定理证明模型，显著提升了数学推理能力，尤其在IMO级问题上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理中表现良好，但在定理证明上因缺乏明确监督信号而受限。

Method: 提出Seed-Prover模型，利用Lean的反馈、已证明引理和自总结迭代优化证明，并设计三种推理策略。

Result: Seed-Prover在IMO问题上达到78.1%的证明率，显著超越现有技术，并在IMO 2025中成功证明5/6问题。

Conclusion: 结合形式化验证和长链推理，Seed-Prover在自动数学推理领域取得重大进展。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Motivation: 当前AI代理局限于单任务单代理模式，缺乏通用性和可扩展性，而人类通过模拟行动结果进行推理。SimuRA旨在实现更通用的智能代理。

Method: SimuRA基于环境中的最优代理原则，引入世界模型进行模拟规划，利用LLM的丰富概念空间灵活应对多种环境。

Conclusion: SimuRA展示了世界模型模拟作为推理范式的优势，为训练通用LLM代理提供了可能性，并发布了基于SimuRA的网页浏览代理供公开测试。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率的列表分布不确定性（LiDu）方法，用于量化推荐模型的自感知能力，无需标签即可评估性能。实验证明LiDu与推荐性能相关性更高，并能揭示模型训练和推理的动态状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推荐模型是否具备自感知能力，通过量化不确定性来无标签评估性能，以提升推荐系统的透明度和自我评估能力。

Method: 提出LiDu方法，通过预测单个项目的分布概率来衡量推荐模型生成特定排名列表的不确定性。

Result: 实验验证LiDu能有效代表模型自感知能力，且与推荐性能相关性优于其他无标签评估方法。

Conclusion: LiDu为推荐系统的不确定性与性能建立了实证联系，推动了更透明和自评估的推荐系统发展。

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

*Wei-Wei Du,Takuma Udagawa,Kei Tateno*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IntervalLLM框架通过动态时间间隔信息增强序列推荐任务，显著提升性能，并引入间隔视角解决冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐方法忽视动态时间间隔的重要性，而间隔信息能更全面地描述用户行为。

Method: 提出IntervalLLM框架，结合间隔信息与LLM，设计间隔注意力机制联合考虑物品和间隔信息。

Result: 在3个基准测试中，IntervalLLM平均提升4.4%，在冷启动场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 间隔视角对冷启动问题至关重要，未来需进一步研究间隔相关的挑战。

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

Motivation: 金融行业依赖预测模型，但传统机器学习方法依赖手工特征工程，而其他领域已成功应用SSL从原始数据中学习表示。本文旨在探索SSL在金融交易数据中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出nuFormer方法，将Transformer模型适配于交易数据，结合文本和结构化属性，并通过端到端微调整合用户嵌入与现有表格特征。

Result: 实验表明，nuFormer在Nubank的大规模推荐问题中表现优异，仅通过改进表示学习而非新增数据源即实现性能提升。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的SSL方法为金融交易数据提供了一种高效表示学习途径，nuFormer展示了其在推荐系统中的实际价值。

Abstract: Predictive models play a crucial role in the financial industry, enabling
risk prediction, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations, where
slight changes in core model performance can result in billions of dollars in
revenue or losses. While financial institutions have access to enormous amounts
of user data (e.g., bank transactions, in-app events, and customer support
logs), leveraging this data effectively remains challenging due to its
complexity and scale. Thus, in many financial institutions, most production
models follow traditional machine learning (ML) approaches by converting
unstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Conversely, other
domains (e.g., natural language processing) have effectively utilized
self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn rich representations from raw data,
removing the need for manual feature extraction. In this paper, we investigate
using transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data,
hypothesizing that these models, trained on massive data, can provide a novel
and powerful approach to understanding customer behavior. We propose a new
method enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting
transformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. Our
approach, denoted nuFormer, includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that
integrates user embeddings with existing tabular features. Our experiments
demonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank.
Notably, these gains are achieved solely through enhanced representation
learning rather than incorporating new data sources.

is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what
these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

Result: 展示了LLMs在产品线范围界定中的潜力。

Conclusion: 讨论了LLMs与产品线范围界定整合的开放研究挑战。

Abstract: The idea of product line scoping is to identify the set of features and
configurations that a product line should include, i.e., offer for
configuration purposes. In this context, a major scoping task is to find a
balance between commercial relevance and technical feasibility. Traditional
product line scoping approaches rely on formal feature models and require a
manual analysis which can be quite time-consuming. In this paper, we sketch how
Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to support product line scoping
tasks with a natural language interaction based scoping process. Using a
working example from the smarthome domain, we sketch how LLMs can be applied to
evaluate different feature model alternatives. We discuss open research
challenges regarding the integration of LLMs with product line scoping.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注页面内交互优化，而忽略了页面导航阶段的个性化需求，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出KLAN框架，包含三个组件：KLAN-ISP（静态偏好）、KLAN-IIT（动态兴趣）和KLAN-AM（自适应整合）。

Result: 在线实验显示，KLAN显著提升了DAU（+0.205%）和用户生命周期（+0.192%）。

Conclusion: KLAN成功部署于快手平台，为大规模用户提供个性化导航服务，并计划公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

Motivation: 大脑衰老合成在临床和计算神经科学中有广泛应用，但高维数据、细微结构变化和个体特异性模式带来了挑战。

Method: NeuroAR通过自回归估计未来扫描的离散令牌映射，结合先前扫描和目标年龄的交叉注意力来引导生成。

Result: 在老年和青少年群体中，NeuroAR在图像保真度上优于现有生成模型，如LDM和GAN。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性的大脑衰老轨迹，显著优于关键模型。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Result: KANs 在准确性、收敛性和频谱表示上优于 MLPs，能更有效地捕捉复杂动态。

Conclusion: KANs 的发展仍面临计算效率、理论保证等挑战，未来研究需提升其鲁棒性、可扩展性和物理一致性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Result: 实验验证了框架的高预测准确性，尤其是BiLSTM架构，并能提供详细的时间解释。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了多灾害预警系统的可解释性和实用性，支持农业气候风险管理决策。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI是一种多模态深度学习框架，用于预测城市热应力，具有高精度和高效性，适用于城市规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着气候变化和城市化加剧极端热事件，城市需要高效工具评估和缓解户外热应力。传统物理模型计算量大，难以扩展。

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI，融合地表形态、土地覆盖数据和气象条件，使用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征，基于SOLWEIG数据训练。

Result: 模型R2为0.9151，MAE为0.41°C，推理时间从小时级降至5分钟。应用于费城绿化场景，显示显著降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是高效、精细的城市气候适应决策工具，支持多样化绿化策略评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Motivation: 现有研究倾向于将AI在人类测试中的表现解释为具有人类特质，但缺乏理论和实证依据，可能误导对AI能力的理解。

Method: 通过分析人类测试的理论基础和适用性，指出将其应用于AI的问题，并提出开发AI专用评估框架的建议。

Result: 论文认为当前用人类测试评估AI的方式存在本体论错误，可能导致误判AI的实际能力。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发专门针对AI的评估框架，以更准确地衡量AI系统的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Result: 实验表明，逆向映射的感知质量混乱且语义不连贯，潜在空间缺乏可解释性。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间需进一步研究以实现语义丰富且可逆的映射。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Motivation: LLM推理因内存和计算需求高而面临挑战，现有WAQ设计在低精度下存在准确率下降和异常检测效率问题。

Method: 提出KLLM框架，采用基于索引的计算方案和Orizuru异常检测引擎，避免解量化和全精度计算。

Result: 实验显示，KLLM在速度和能效上分别比A100 GPU和Atom提升9.67x、7.03x和229.50x、150.21x。

Conclusion: KLLM有效解决了WAQ在LLM推理中的挑战，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Result: 发现一小部分但具有显著影响的滞后项，表明个体行为对流程性能（如吞吐时间）有直接和可测量的影响。

Conclusion: 基于时间序列的行为分析方法能更细致地揭示个体行为对流程效率的影响，为流程优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Motivation: 万古霉素是ICU中治疗严重革兰氏阳性感染的关键抗生素，但其肾毒性风险高，早期预测肾功能损伤具有挑战性。

Method: 研究分析了10,288名ICU患者的数据，使用KDIGO标准定义肾损伤，通过特征选择和多种算法（包括CatBoost）进行建模，并评估了模型的可解释性。

Result: CatBoost表现最佳（AUROC 0.818），关键预测因子包括磷酸盐、总胆红素等，模型在高风险病例中平均风险为60.5%。

Conclusion: 该模型能早期预测万古霉素相关的肾功能损伤，支持ICU中的及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Conclusion: 该模型为断裂预测提供了一种统一、可扩展的解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: BiGG-E为加权图的生成提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between

investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FuseTen的生成框架，通过融合Sentinel-2、Landsat 8和Terra MODIS的观测数据，生成每日10米空间分辨率的地表温度（LST）数据。该方法在定量指标和视觉保真度上分别提升了32.06%和31.42%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热浪、干旱和土地退化在气候变化背景下日益严峻，需要高精度时空信息来研究这些问题。地表温度（LST）是关键变量，但卫星观测存在时空分辨率权衡问题。

Method: FuseTen采用生成架构，结合注意力机制和归一化模块，使用基于物理原理的平均监督策略训练，并通过PatchGAN判别器增强真实性。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标上平均提升32.06%，视觉保真度提升31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能以10米空间分辨率生成每日LST的非线性方法，为研究地表热状态提供了新工具。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

Theorem for LLM-application design.

*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NaN-propagation的方法，利用IEEE 754浮点数的NaN特性检测黑盒函数的稀疏性，避免了传统有限差分法的假阴性问题，显著提升了梯度计算的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分法在检测黑盒函数稀疏性时存在假阴性问题，导致梯度计算错误且难以诊断。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出是否变为NaN，重建保守的稀疏模式，消除假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型中，该方法实现了1.52倍的加速，并检测到传统方法遗漏的数十个依赖关系。

Conclusion: NaN-propagation方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改现有黑盒代码即可跨语言和数学库工作，显著提升了稀疏性检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂多模态文档的结构不一致性和训练数据有限，导致理解困难。

Method: 结合伪目录生成、零样本多模态分析和分层检索技术，利用多模态大语言模型原生能力处理文档。

Result: 在平均49.4页的文档上，查询延迟降低45%，在MMLongBench-Doc基准测试中准确率达64.7%。

Conclusion: DocsRay无需额外训练即可高效处理多模态文档，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决AI生成文本中上下文幻觉的问题，提供可操作的检测和缓解方法。

Result: 发现一个可转移的线性方向区分幻觉与忠实文本，性能优于基线，且能通过操纵该方向因果控制幻觉率。

Conclusion: 揭示了内部低维幻觉跟踪机制，并发布了ContraTales基准用于评估。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增量学习视角的高效机器遗忘算法（IAU），解决了传统基于影响的遗忘方法计算开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）受到关注。传统基于影响的方法因计算Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵的开销过大，难以应用于大规模模型和频繁数据删除场景。

Method: 受认知科学启发，论文建立了增量学习（记忆）与遗忘（遗忘）的理论联系，提出了一种基于增量学习视角的高效机器遗忘算法（IAU）。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在移除保证、遗忘效率和模型性能之间取得了优越的平衡，并在多种数据集和模型架构上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IAU算法通过增量学习的视角解决了机器遗忘的难题，为高效遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSwarm 是一个动态多智能体系统框架，通过强化学习和动态图选择优化协作结构，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统框架依赖静态协作图结构，限制了适应性和性能。

Method: 采用演员-评论家强化学习（A2C）优化图结构，并通过动态图选择器为每个输入样本选择最优结构。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和编程任务中，DynaSwarm 均优于现有单智能体和多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分析框架，用于量化深度学习训练中个体样本的隐私泄露动态，揭示了样本隐私风险与其学习难度之间的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管成员推理攻击（MIAs）对深度学习训练数据的隐私构成严重威胁，但对模型在训练过程中如何编码成员信息的理解仍有限。

Method: 通过跟踪训练过程中个体样本在FPR-TPR平面上的脆弱性，系统测量数据集复杂性、模型架构和优化器选择等因素对样本隐私风险的影响。

Result: 发现样本的隐私风险与其内在学习难度密切相关，且最终模型中高脆弱性样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解隐私风险在训练中的动态出现提供了基础，支持开发主动的隐私感知模型训练策略。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers库为序列建模提供了高效、正确且易于使用的工具，已在JAX和TensorFlow 2中实现。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于结果的奖励反馈稀疏，导致优化效率低下，因此需要更有效的奖励机制来加速训练。

Method: 提出了一种内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，将连续正确/错误的步骤聚合为连贯的“思维”单元，并引入能力自适应的奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上，比传统方法用更少的训练样本实现了更高的解题准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化过程奖励能显著加速LRMs在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

TL;DR: CostCert是一种新颖、可扩展且精确的基于投票的认证恢复防御方法，用于验证样本的真实标签是否在前k个预测中，避免了组合爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术在适用于前k预测时，通常通过标签间的成对比较来验证，但由于攻击者控制的投票数量膨胀（即攻击预算），无法精确认证真实标签。

Method: CostCert通过设计验证攻击预算是否不足以覆盖最小的额外投票总数，从而排除真实标签不在前k预测中的情况，避免了成对比较和组合爆炸。

Result: 实验表明，CostCert显著优于现有技术PatchGuard，例如在补丁大小为96时，Certified准确率仍保持57.3%，而PatchGuard已降至零。

Conclusion: CostCert提供了一种高效且精确的方法，用于认证前k预测中的真实标签，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Motivation: 共享单车系统中，时空变化的用户需求导致库存不平衡，增加了重新分配成本，因此需要通过动态定价管理需求。

Method: 开发了一种可微分代理模拟方法，用于快速设计动态定价策略，考虑了用户多样性和概率选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统方法减少了73%至78%的损失，收敛速度提高了100倍以上，并在大规模系统中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 动态定价策略能自然平衡库存，无需人工干预，且通过设置合适的初始条件可以最小化折扣成本。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Result: 在MetaWorld的机器人操作任务中，PLARE性能达到或超过现有VLM奖励生成方法，并在真实机器人任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种高效且实用的离线强化学习解决方案，减少了奖励设计的依赖。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a system for detecting adulteration in coconut
milk, utilizing infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning-based proposed
system comprises three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In

milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared

Motivation: 解决传统方法在建模时间依赖偏微分方程时参数效率低和长程动态建模困难的问题。

Method: 提出时空状态空间神经算子（ST-SSM），通过分解时空维度并独立建模时间演化和空间交互。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优于替代方案，参数更少且性能竞争。

Conclusion: 时空分解的算子学习方法高效且泛化性强，为PDE建模提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Result: Coflex在多个基准测试中表现优异，网络精度和能效比均优于现有方法，计算速度提升1.9x至9.5x。

Conclusion: Coflex为HW-NAS提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了计算效率和优化性能。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Conclusion: 本文框架补充了现有稳健因果推断方法，解决了实践中常被忽视的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态集成聚合方法（DEA），通过可学习的方向参数自适应地结合Q值估计，解决了静态集成规则的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态集成规则（如取最小值）在连续控制任务中过于粗糙，无法适应任务需求或学习阶段的变化，导致信息浪费和性能受限。

Method: DEA引入两个可学习的方向参数，分别调节批评者的保守性和行动者的探索性，通过基于贝尔曼误差方向的加权机制动态调整。

Result: 在多种连续控制基准和学习阶段中，DEA优于静态集成策略，表现出更高的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的方式动态调整集成聚合，显著提升了强化学习在连续控制任务中的效果。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Method: 提出并证明了一个验证器权衡定理，分析了证书长度与验证时间的关系，并将其应用于复杂性类分离和自然问题。

Result: 证明了减少验证时间需要增加证书长度，并展示了该定理在复杂性理论和实际问题中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该定理为复杂性类分离和自然问题提供了新的分析工具，并对P vs. NP问题提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Motivation: 现有高概率收敛分析通常要求剪裁阈值随优化步骤增加，这与标准差分隐私机制（如高斯机制）不兼容，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用固定剪裁阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，适用于重尾噪声下的凸和非凸平滑优化，假设噪声具有有界中心α阶矩（α∈(1,2]）。

Result: 结果表明，固定剪裁阈值的方法能以比现有方法更快的速度收敛到最优解的邻域，且该邻域可与差分隐私引入的噪声平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法在收敛速度和隐私保证之间提供了更精细的权衡，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上，方法优于9个基线，准确率分别提升10%、6%和13%。

Conclusion: 通过引入SBD作为隐式正则化器，显著改善了决策边界的稳定性并减少了遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLM的多跳推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于能量深度学习的生成式信号解混方法（EB-gMCR），可自动发现最小组件集并准确重构数据，适用于大规模信号分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多变量曲线分辨率（MCR）方法在组件数量未知或数据规模大时面临可扩展性和可靠性挑战。

Method: 将MCR重新定义为生成过程（gMCR），并引入能量深度学习求解器EB-gMCR，通过可微分门控网络从候选池中选择活跃组件。

Result: 在噪声合成数据中，EB-gMCR保持了高精度（R^2 >= 0.98）并接近真实组件数量（误差<5%）。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了分层策略和消息传递，为多智能体系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Result: 模型在真实数据上表现优异，能有效预测患者入组数量，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习方法为临床试验规划提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Method: 使用Transformer-based变分循环自编码器，在潜在空间中进行受控变换，生成多样化且保留原始数据特性的时间序列。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，L-GTA生成的增强数据更可靠、一致且可控，显著优于直接变换方法。

Conclusion: L-GTA为时间序列数据增强提供了一种高效、可控的生成方法，显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 揭示了softmax注意力的RNN形式及其各组件的作用，解释了其表达力更强的原因。

Conclusion: softmax注意力的RNN形式及其组件分析为理解其优越性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust和FedBN-Prox有效应对拜占庭攻击和数据异质性，为联邦学习提供鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage
points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions while maintaining robust
performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning
approach.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在处理个性化查询时缓存响应难以保持相关性的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级LLM动态调整缓存响应以适应新查询。

Result: TweakLLM在保持响应质量的同时显著提高了缓存效率。

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展且资源高效的LLM缓存解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Motivation: 扩散策略在在线强化学习中表现优异，但其推理速度受限于缓慢的迭代采样过程。

Method: FPMD利用流匹配模型中单步采样的分布方差与离散化误差的理论联系，提出了基于流策略和MeanFlow策略的两种算法变体。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，FPMD性能与扩散策略基线相当，但推理时函数评估次数减少数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，为在线强化学习提供了更快速的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Motivation: 微生物组数据的稀疏性和噪声问题阻碍了下游任务（如生物标志物发现），现有方法未能充分捕捉微生物间的复杂依赖关系和上下文元数据。

Method: DepMicroDiff结合扩散生成模型和依赖感知Transformer（DAT），利用VAE预训练和LLM编码的元数据条件化。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上，DepMicroDiff在Pearson相关性（0.712）、余弦相似度（0.812）及RMSE和MAE上表现优异。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据填补中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，为下游任务提供了更准确的数据支持。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Motivation: 主动学习（AL）中标注数据的成本和时间问题已被广泛关注，但现有方法未充分考虑标注者的内部因素（如情绪、疲劳）对标注质量的影响。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种知识推荐系统（RS），结合标注者的历史准确率、情绪和疲劳水平，以及查询实例的信息，为每个查询选择最佳标注者。

Result: 实验表明，考虑内部因素显著减少了标注错误和模型不确定性，并在准确率和F1分数上有所提升。

Conclusion: 本研究首次探索了人类认知因素对主动学习的影响，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA显著优于现有方法，标注工作量减少70%以上。

Conclusion: CODA提供了一种高效的主动模型选择方法，大幅降低了标注成本。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 解决大规模全数字MIMO架构的高能耗、高电路成本和高复杂度问题，同时解决H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源数量和方向智能感知的开放难题。

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架：1）三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC、基于统计特征的增强DNN、利用全特征值的改进1D-CNN）；2）引入在线微聚类（OMC-DOA）方法进行DOA估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，三种目标数量感知方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，改进的1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H2AD MIMO架构的两阶段感知框架有效解决了多发射源数量和方向估计问题，为未来无线网络提供了高效、低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了双层优化问题，提出了一种适用于非凸问题的动态屏障梯度下降方法，首次实现了多项式时间内的联合平稳性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非凸双层优化问题中缺乏全局最优性保证的挑战，提出一种新的平稳性概念。

Method: 采用动态屏障梯度下降（DBGD）框架，设计了一种可实现的算法，用于寻找联合平稳点。

Result: 算法在多项式时间内达到$(\epsilon_f, \epsilon_g)$-平稳点，复杂度为$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}}, \epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$。

Conclusion: 这是首个在非凸双层优化问题中实现联合平稳性保证的离散时间算法，具有理论和实际意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization
problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of
the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the
upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to
the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level
objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL)
condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we
introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim
to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in
polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the
upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing
a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that
a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent
(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel
problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f,
\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the
target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,
respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},
\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary
constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint
stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.

### [164] [Extended Factorization Machine Annealing for Rapid Discovery of Transparent Conducting Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23160)
*Daisuke Makino,Tatsuya Goto,Yoshinori Suga*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合因子分解机（FM）和退火算法的新方法，用于高效搜索透明导电材料（TCMs）的最优组成和晶体结构，并在多目标优化中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发新型透明导电材料（TCMs）对提升下一代设备（如太阳能电池和显示器）的性能和降低成本至关重要。

Method: 扩展了FMA框架，引入连续变量二值化、Hopfield网络利用、自适应随机翻转激活全局搜索以及位串局部搜索微调。

Result: 在Kaggle竞赛数据验证中，该方法比贝叶斯优化和遗传算法更快、更准确，并在多目标优化中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有望应用于更复杂的问题和多样化材料设计，推动材料信息学的进一步发展。

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the
further advancement of materials informatics.

### [165] [LLMs Between the Nodes: Community Discovery Beyond Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22955)
*Ekta Gujral,Apurva Sinha*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CommLLM的两步框架，利用GPT-4o模型和基于提示的推理，将语言模型输出与图结构融合，用于社交网络图中的社区检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注图的结构特性，而大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展为结合语义和上下文信息提供了新途径，因此研究LLM在社区检测中的应用具有重要意义。

Method: 提出CommLLM框架，结合GPT-4o模型和提示推理，将语言模型输出与图结构融合，并在六个真实社交网络数据集上评估性能。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs（尤其是结合图感知策略时）可成功应用于中小型图的社区检测任务，且指令调优模型和精心设计的提示显著提高了检测准确性和一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在图研究中具有潜力，但需根据图数据的特定结构定制模型交互方式。

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering
group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional
methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic
and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed
investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying
communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called
CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to
fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on
six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics
such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that
LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully
applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We
observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully
engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of
detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs
in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model
interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经似然估计的方法，用于解决下一代中微子实验中的探测器能量响应建模问题，并展示了在JUNO实验中的成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确建模探测器能量响应对于下一代中微子实验至关重要，但由于缺乏解析似然函数，计算上存在挑战。

Method: 提出了两种互补的神经密度估计器（条件归一化流和基于Transformer的回归器）来建模校准数据的似然函数，并结合贝叶斯嵌套采样进行参数推断。

Result: 实现了仅受统计限制的不确定性，系统偏差接近零，同时提供了无分箱和分箱两种分析选项。

Conclusion: 该方法为中微子实验及更广泛的粒子物理应用提供了灵活且高效的建模框架。

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation
neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of
analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood
estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two
complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration
data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt
JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of
JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their
non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this
end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for
parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with
near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned
likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned
alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to
choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach
establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino
and broader particle physics.

*Sotheara Leang,Éric Castelli,Dominique Vaufreydaz,Sethserey Sam*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合SSCF动态参数和MFCC的方法，用于越南语ASR，显著降低了词错误率并提高了性别独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态语音信号特性对ASR性能至关重要，但传统MFCC可能无法充分捕捉这些特性。

Method: 使用SSCF的极坐标参数表征语音动态特性，并与MFCC结合；SSCF0作为伪特征描述基频。

Result: 提出的参数显著降低了词错误率，且比基线MFCC更具性别独立性。

Conclusion: 结合SSCF动态参数和MFCC的方法在越南语ASR中表现优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MECAT基准和DATE指标，用于细粒度音频理解任务，填补了现有评测的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型在细粒度理解上表现不足，主要因为评测基准和数据标注的局限性。

Method: 通过专家模型和链式思维大语言模型生成多视角细粒度标注和问答对，并设计DATE指标。

Result: MECAT和DATE提供了更可靠的评测，揭示了当前音频模型的局限。

Conclusion: MECAT和DATE为音频理解任务提供了更精细的评测工具，推动了领域发展。

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

*Taiyi Wang,Eiko Yoneki*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AutoIndexer是一个结合工作负载压缩、查询优化和专用RL模型的框架，用于高效扩展索引选择，显著降低搜索复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模分析工作负载下，基于强化学习的索引选择方法因动作空间指数增长和试错成本高而难以适应，AutoIndexer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过工作负载压缩降低搜索复杂度，结合查询优化和专用RL模型，实现高效的索引选择。

Result: 与非索引基线相比，查询执行时间减少95%；相比现有RL索引顾问，节省20%工作负载成本，调优时间减少50%。

Conclusion: AutoIndexer在大规模多样化工作负载下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在信息可视化中的能力，包括代码生成和问题回答。

Method: 评估不同流行LLMs生成可视化代码的能力，并测试其对常见可视化的理解。

Result: LLMs能生成简单图表代码并回答简单问题，但在复杂任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为改进LLMs和可视化系统提供参考。

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人机交互研究忽视了AI系统如何无意识地重塑人类认知，CIS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过叙事场景和“基础设施崩溃方法”研究AI预处理的影响。

Result: 揭示了AI如何通过自动化“相关性判断”转移认知代理权，并影响个人、集体和社会层面的认知。

Conclusion: CIS为跨学科研究AI对认知的影响提供了新框架和方法。

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的用户模拟器在模拟真实用户和提供定量评估方面存在不足，需要更真实、多样化的模拟器。

Method: RecUserSim包含多个模块：用户画像、记忆、核心行为（基于有限理性理论）和优化模块，以生成细粒度动作和个性化响应。

Result: 实验表明，RecUserSim能生成多样且可控的输出，产生高质量对话，且评分在不同LLM间一致性高。

Conclusion: RecUserSim有效提升了CRS评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

course. In the first part, students completed a programming task with access to
AI support; in the second, they extended their solutions without AI. We
collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to evaluate
their perceptions and challenges. Findings suggest that AI tools were perceived
as helpful for understanding code and increasing confidence, particularly
during initial development. However, students reported difficulties
transferring knowledge to unaided tasks, revealing possible overreliance and
gaps in conceptual understanding. These insights highlight the need for
pedagogical strategies that integrate AI meaningfully while reinforcing

Motivation: 全球预计到2030年将短缺1100万医疗从业者，且行政负担占用了50%的临床时间。AI有望缓解这些问题，但此前未有端到端自主LLM AI系统在真实临床环境中严格评估。

Method: 回顾性比较多代理AI系统Doctronic与认证临床医生在500次紧急护理远程医疗中的表现，通过盲法LLM裁决和专家评审评估诊断一致性、治疗计划一致性和安全性。

Result: Doctronic与临床医生的诊断一致率为81%，治疗计划一致率为99.2%，无临床幻觉。在专家评审的不一致案例中，AI表现更优占36.1%，人类更优占9.3%。

Conclusion: 多代理AI系统在临床决策中与人类医生相当，甚至更优，为解决医疗人力短缺提供了潜在方案。

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

TL;DR: SketchMind是一个基于认知的多智能体框架，用于评估和改进学生绘制的科学草图，解决了现有方法在可解释性、教学对齐和适应性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估自由形式、视觉多样的科学草图时缺乏可解释性和教学对齐，无法适应不同认知水平的需求。

Method: SketchMind采用模块化智能体，分别负责评分标准解析、草图感知、认知对齐和迭代反馈，实现个性化和透明的评估。

Result: 在3,575个学生草图的测试中，SketchMind的平均准确率达到77.1%，显著优于基线模型（55.6%）。多智能体协作进一步提升了性能，人类评价也显示其反馈质量更高。

Conclusion: SketchMind通过认知对齐和多智能体协作，显著提升了科学草图的评估效果，具有支持概念成长的潜力。

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

Motivation: 传统辅助沟通和语言学习系统无法实时适应用户的认知和语言需求，尤其是在神经系统疾病中。

Method: 利用实时脑电图（EEG）信号驱动LLM，实现个性化语言康复辅助。

Result: 系统支持通过思维指令导航语言学习模块，动态调整任务难度。

Conclusion: 该框架为严重语言或运动障碍患者提供了创新的康复解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

Conclusion: 当前系统需人工监督，未来语音AI的进步有望实现高准确性评估，普及专业医疗能力。

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

### [179] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动标签放置（ALP）新方法，通过数据编辑任务和上下文感知的空间标注，结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，显著提升了标签放置的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动标签放置系统难以整合制图惯例、适应上下文或解析标签指令，导致标签放置仍依赖手动操作且难以扩展。

Method: 利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术获取与地标类型相关的标签指南，将其整合到提示中，并通过指令调优的LLMs生成理想标签坐标。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在结构化提示和领域特定检索的指导下，能够生成符合专家制图标准的空间编辑结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI辅助地图标注提供了可扩展框架，展示了基础模型在结构化数据编辑任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统Accessibility Scout，通过照片自动评估陌生建筑环境的无障碍性，并实现个性化需求匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动评估无障碍环境的方法效率低且难以扩展，而现有自动化方法常忽略用户个性化需求。LLM的发展为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 开发了Accessibility Scout系统，利用LLM分析建筑环境照片，结合用户个性化需求（如行动能力、偏好）生成无障碍评估报告。

Result: 技术评估和用户研究表明，Accessibility Scout能生成超越传统ADA标准的个性化无障碍评估报告。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLM在无障碍评估中的潜力，未来可进一步扩展个性化和可扩展性。

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

TL;DR: DUET是一个基于LLM的工具，用于比较学生提交的UML/ER图与参考图，并提供结构化反馈，支持自主学习和教学改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统教学方法难以提供个性化反馈，尤其是在大班教学中，DUET旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DUET通过多阶段LLM管道将图表转换为文本表示，并基于差异生成反馈。

Result: 评估显示DUET在可访问性、扩展性和学习支持方面表现良好，但也存在可靠性和潜在滥用问题。

Conclusion: DUET为LLM在建模教育中的应用提供了有前景的方向，并为进一步课堂整合和实证评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

*Dominique Geissler,Claire Robertson,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究比较了五种数字素养干预措施，提升人们识别Deepfake的能力，结果显示干预措施可提升识别率13个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake可能破坏社会信任和选举结果，需要探索可扩展且有效的数字素养提升方法。

Method: 比较五种干预措施：文本指导、视觉演示、游戏化练习、隐式学习及AI生成解释，实验涉及1,200名美国参与者。

Result: 干预措施显著提升Deepfake识别能力（最高13个百分点），同时保持对真实图像的信任。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展、适用于多样化人群，有效提升Deepfake检测能力且不影响对真实信息的信任。

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的人类注视扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性，ScanDiff旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，利用扩散模型的随机性生成多样扫描路径，并引入文本条件实现任务驱动生成。

Result: 在基准数据集上，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法，生成更多样且准确的扫描路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动注视预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 深度学习超分辨率技术（SR）可提升低质量超声心动图的分类准确性，尤其在资源有限环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源有限环境下低质量超声心动图影响诊断模型效果的问题。

Method: 使用SRGAN和SRResNet模型增强低质量图像，并在CAMUS数据集上评估两种分类任务。

Result: SRResNet显著提升性能且计算高效，证明SR能恢复退化超声心动图的诊断价值。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术是资源有限环境中AI辅助诊断的有效工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多种输入数据（如摄像头图像、高清地图、LiDAR深度和文本路径点）实现实时推理，提高了自动驾驶的成功率和路径效率，同时减少了碰撞频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在复杂环境中快速反应，同时考虑道路几何和交通意图。现有的方法需要改进以实现更高的效率和安全性。

Method: NovaDrive采用单分支架构，结合两阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点与高清地图，并通过平滑损失函数避免突然的转向和速度变化。基于LLaMA-3.2视觉语言模型微调。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，NovaDrive将成功率提升至84%（+4%），路径效率（SPL）提升至0.66（+0.11），碰撞频率从2.6%降至1.2%（-1.4%）。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过路径点标记、部分VLM微调和交叉注意力融合显著提升了性能，同时缩短路径降低了能耗，适用于其他具身AI领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新的合成数据生成方法MObI和AnydoorMed，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实感和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据采集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实感和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型进行多模态对象修复，支持3D定位；AnydoorMed扩展至医学图像，实现参考引导的异常修复。

Result: 两种方法均能生成高度真实且可控的多模态合成数据，适用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于扩散模型的参考引导修复方法可适应多种感知模态，为构建高真实感合成数据提供了新途径。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单一模型，通过融合摄像头、地图和路径点数据，实现自动驾驶的高效导航和语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要同时处理几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常将它们分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型实现两者的融合。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层，融合摄像头帧、地图和路径点数据，并通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型输出控制指令。

Result: 在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%的成功率和0.80 SPL，性能优于PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半。

Conclusion: 早期、基于令牌级别的意图和地图布局融合，能够实现准确、透明且实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Motivation: 优化多样化和非结构化真实世界文档的查询仍具挑战性，RL-QR旨在提供一种无需人工标注的解决方案。

Method: 通过合成场景-问题对并利用广义奖励策略优化（GRPO），训练针对特定检索器的查询重写器。

Result: 在多模态RAG中，RL-QR相对提升了11%的NDCG@3；在词汇检索器中提升了9%。语义和混合检索器性能未改善。

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统的查询优化提供了可扩展的无标注解决方案，但在语义检索方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

TL;DR: SAM2模型用于低成本、低输入的3D乳腺MRI肿瘤分割，中心向外传播策略表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决商业AI工具在高成本、基础设施需求下在低收入国家难以普及的问题。

Method: 使用SAM2模型，通过单一切片的边界框标注，采用三种切片追踪策略进行3D分割。

Result: 中心向外传播策略最准确，SAM2在零样本情况下表现良好。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可在资源有限环境中低成本支持3D医学图像分析。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA提出了一种基于重建的视觉令牌修剪框架，专注于自动驾驶场景中的前景信息，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌修剪方法在自动驾驶场景中表现不佳，而人类驾驶时关注前景信息，因此需要保留包含前景信息的视觉令牌。

Method: 提出ReconPruner，通过MAE风格像素重建和对抗性前景-背景重建策略修剪视觉令牌。

Result: 在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，不同修剪比例下均取得最优结果。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的视觉令牌修剪性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自适应分组对齐（AGA）的新框架，用于从医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义，解决了现有方法忽略报告结构和依赖大量负样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉语言预训练方法简化了临床报告的结构，且对比学习框架依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不实用。

Method: AGA通过双向分组机制和稀疏相似性矩阵，动态学习分组阈值，并引入实例感知分组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公共和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，适用于微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过结构化语义捕获和自适应分组，有效提升了医学视觉表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 利用机器学习和人工智能解决复杂问题，如通过X光片预测疾病，减少显式编程的需求。

Method: 采用基线CNN和DenseNet-121算法对胸部X光片进行二元分类，并使用梯度加权类激活映射分析决策依据。

Result: 两种算法表现良好，但DenseNet-121更准确地聚焦于图像关键区域。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在胸部X光片分类任务中优于基线CNN，尤其在决策依据的准确性上。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Method: 系统分为两部分：1) 基于LDA和KNN的蜜源分类子系统；2) 基于相同技术的掺假检测子系统。

Result: 在公开数据集上，系统交叉验证准确率达96.39%。

Conclusion: 该系统是化学检测方法的有效替代方案，具有高精度和实用性。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决联邦学习中分辨率漂移问题的方法（RAF），通过热图知识蒸馏提升分辨率鲁棒性，适用于非分类任务如人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分类任务中表现良好，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中因分辨率漂移问题性能下降，亟需解决。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），利用热图知识蒸馏在多分辨率间传递知识，避免过拟合。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF有效缓解分辨率漂移，显著提升性能，并可无缝集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，其通用性还支持其他依赖空间细节的任务。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Motivation: 随着图像分类模型的多样化和复杂性增加，选择合适模型的需求日益重要，但对其决策过程的理解有限。

Method: 通过分析最小充分像素集的位置、重叠和大小，比较不同架构模型的‘集中度’。

Result: 发现ConvNext和EVA模型在像素集大小和位置上与其他模型显著不同，且误分类图像需要更大的像素集。

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集是理解模型决策过程的有效工具，不同架构的模型表现出不同的‘集中度’特征。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过SVD分解ControlNet，实现统一可控生成和高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么为每个条件训练单独模型，要么依赖统一架构但表示纠缠，导致泛化能力差和适应成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，通过知识转移实现条件无关的learngenes和条件特定的tailors，并引入动态门和表示对齐损失。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时在基础条件和未见条件上表现优异。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Conclusion: SAMSA在少样本和零样本学习场景中表现优异，支持不同光谱特性数据集的灵活集成。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Motivation: 传统VRD模型泛化能力有限，手工提示调优难以处理新颖或复杂关系。

Method: 将VRD数据集转换为指令调优格式，采用自适应采样算法，专注于信息丰富的关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于基线，支持未见关系推理，并用于复杂场景分割。

Conclusion: 指令调优是VRD的有效解决方案，ART框架具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）在提高AI透明度方面表现出色，但在分布偏移下难以可靠识别正确概念，因此需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过选择CUB数据集的子集，生成38,400张合成图像，并引入TDG方法，通过共享噪声确保生成图像的正确类别和属性。

Result: SUB基准和TDG方法为CBMs的鲁棒性评估提供了新工具，促进了更稳健方法的发展。

Conclusion: SUB基准和TDG方法为概念解释模型的鲁棒性研究提供了重要支持，推动了透明AI的发展。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Motivation: 当前SOTA方法在小物体处理上表现不佳，且评估设置未充分利用昂贵标注数据。

Method: 提出EMAT，包含内存高效的掩码注意力机制、可学习降采样策略和参数效率优化。

Result: 在PASCAL-5^i和COCO-20^i数据集上超越所有方法，参数减少4倍。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升性能，并引入更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 高保真3D视频重建对VR/AR中的动态场景实时渲染至关重要，但现有方法在复杂运动和尺度变化下表现不佳。

Method: FlowGaussian-VR包含速度场渲染管道和流辅助自适应密集化策略，优化动态内容重建。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，视觉质量显著提升（PSNR增益超过2.5 dB），动态纹理模糊减少，轨迹更规则。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR有效提升了动态场景重建的视觉质量和轨迹跟踪能力。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Motivation: 当前端到端接地模型在复杂基准测试中准确率不足65%，无法满足实际部署需求，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过实证研究，从数据收集到模型训练优化接地模型的细节，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Conclusion: 研究不仅改进了接地模型，还为其他感知任务提供了有益经验。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify

framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our
findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated
as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to
fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we
formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation
systems.

*Lijia Liu,Takumi Kondo,Kyohei Atarashi,Koh Takeuchi,Jiyi Li,Shigeru Saito,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种防御LLM评估系统免受提示注入攻击的方法，通过结合标准评估（SE）和反事实评估（CFE）来检测欺骗性回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM评估系统在盲攻击下的脆弱性，并提出防御措施。

Method: 提出SE+CFE框架，通过重新评估提交答案在虚假真实答案下的表现来检测攻击。

Result: 实验表明，SE+CFE显著提高了攻击检测率，且性能损失最小。

Conclusion: SE+CFE框架有效提升了LLM评估系统的安全性。

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

### [209] [LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611)
*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用LLM（如gpt-4o-mini）分析感染截图的新方法，以提取潜在威胁指标（IoCs）并追踪恶意活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注主动检测恶意软件，而忽略了利用感染截图等反应性分析手段。手动分析大量窃取日志不切实际，因此需要一种可扩展的方法。

Method: 利用LLM分析感染截图，提取URL、安装文件和软件主题等感染向量，并关联数据以识别恶意活动。

Result: 从1000张截图中提取了337个可操作URL和246个相关文件，识别出3个不同的恶意活动。

Conclusion: 通过LLM驱动的分析，本研究提供了一种可扩展的方法，用于识别感染向量并增强威胁情报。

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

### [210] [From Propagator to Oscillator: The Dual Role of Symmetric Differential Equations in Neural Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22916)
*Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对称微分方程的神经元模型，深入研究了其功能多样性，揭示了系统的功能二元性，并通过模拟验证了参数调整对功能切换的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前提出的神经元模型，进一步探索其内在动力学和功能多样性，以扩展其在神经形态工程中的应用。

Method: 通过系统探索参数空间和数学分析工具，理论揭示了系统的功能二元性，并引入了一种新的中间状态度量指标（on-road energy）。

Result: 模型表现出两种轨迹行为：一种是渐近稳定的信号传播器，另一种是Lyapunov稳定的信号发生器。模拟结果表明，参数调整或连接结构修改可诱导功能切换。

Conclusion: 研究为神经元模型在信息传递和节律生成中的双重作用提供了理论依据，为其在神经形态工程中的广泛应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

### [211] [On LLM-Assisted Generation of Smart Contracts from Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23087)
*Fabian Stiehle,Hans Weytjens,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）从业务流程描述生成智能合约代码的可行性，并提出了自动化评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的代码生成方法存在局限性，LLMs被探索为替代方案，但现有研究缺乏对生成代码正确执行的系统性评估。

Method: 引入自动化评估框架，测试不同类型和大小的LLMs在生成智能合约代码时的表现，重点关注流程执行的关键属性。

Result: LLMs在生成智能合约代码时未能达到完美可靠性，尤其是在流程执行、资源分配和数据条件等方面。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索如何将LLMs负责任地集成到现有代码生成工具中，以提高可靠性。提出的评估框架可作为开发此类集成的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

### [212] [SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23348)
*Han Li,Yuling Shi,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Heng Lian,Xin Wang,Yantao Jia,Tao Huang,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate提出了一种基于多代理辩论的框架，通过竞争性讨论解决软件工程问题，显著提升了问题定位和修复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理框架在独立探索中容易陷入局部解，难以识别跨代码库的问题模式，SWE-Debate旨在通过多代理辩论解决这一局限性。

Method: SWE-Debate通过代码依赖图生成多个故障传播路径，组织三轮辩论，由不同视角的代理协作形成修复计划，最后通过MCTS代理生成补丁。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，SWE-Debate取得了最先进的成果，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SWE-Debate通过多代理辩论框架有效提升了问题定位和修复能力，为软件工程任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Exp提出了一种基于经验的LLM代理方法，通过从历史修复轨迹中提取知识，实现持续学习，显著提高了软件问题解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理缺乏记忆能力，无法复用历史修复经验，导致冗余探索和效率低下。

Method: 引入多维度经验库，从高层次问题理解到具体代码变更，提取可复用的修复知识。

Result: 在SWE-bench-Verified上达到41.6%的Pass@1解决率，表现最优。

Conclusion: SWE-Exp通过经验积累和复用，实现了从试错探索到战略驱动的软件问题解决范式转变。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

*Siyuan Liu,Zhice Yang,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoBridge自动化生成物联网设备集成代码，通过分阶段调试确保正确性，显著减少人工干预，性能优于专家编程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少人工编程复杂物联网集成代码的需求，提升效率和准确性。

Method: 采用分而治之策略：首先生成设备控制逻辑，再合成平台兼容代码；配备多阶段调试管道。

Result: 在34个设备上测试，平均成功率93.87%，功能覆盖率94.87%；用户反馈后可达100%。

Conclusion: AutoBridge高效且准确，优于专家编程，适用于物联网设备集成。

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出可解释的自主业务流程（XABPs），以解决自主业务流程（ABPs）可能带来的信任、调试、责任、偏见和合规性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主业务流程（ABPs）虽能提升效率和降低成本，但也可能引发信任和合规性问题，因此需要可解释性。

Method: 论文系统化地探讨了XABPs的形式、解释性结构，并指出了实现XABPs的关键研究挑战。

Result: 提出了XABPs的概念框架，为未来研究指明了方向。

Conclusion: XABPs是解决ABPs潜在问题的有效途径，需进一步研究以实现其潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，Trae Agent平均性能提升10.22%，Pass@1得分达75.20%，位居榜首。

Conclusion: Trae Agent作为开源项目发布，为研究社区提供了高效的问题解决工具。

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at

Motivation: 探索AI音乐生成平台的潜力与局限，反思作者在AI辅助创作中的角色和身份变化。

Method: 使用基于提示的AI音乐生成平台创作两张专辑，并通过LLM进行自我访谈。

Result: 揭示了AI生成音乐的“练习化”和“制作化”倾向，并提出了关于作者身份和音乐空间的深层问题。

Conclusion: AI音乐创作不仅是工具，更是作者身份和创作空间的重新定义过程。

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

Motivation: 为高效算法开发和并行计算提供适合函数式编程语言的线性代数框架。

Result: 构建了无索引、类型化的线性代数框架，支持四阶张量，并展示了在2Vec范畴中的操作。

Conclusion: 该框架为线性代数计算提供了更通用的形式化工具，适用于复杂数据结构和高性能计算。

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient
algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and
faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of
linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices,
$\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the
results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this
perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define
semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as
1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This
formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that
includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend
the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed
operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky.

Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域的部署暴露了可能导致重大社会危害的漏洞，现有方法依赖专家手动关联新报告，缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 将任务形式化为排名问题，利用嵌入余弦相似度比较报告与现有事件，评估了传统词汇方法、交叉编码器架构和基于Transformer的句子嵌入模型。

Result: 基于Transformer的模型表现最佳，结合标题和描述显著提高了排名准确性，且检索性能随训练集扩大而提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI事件数据库的维护提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such
as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency
and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains
has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To
systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident
Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure
reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident
relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the
identification of emerging failure patterns.
  To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that
automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through
semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where
each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to
previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity.
Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and
transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter
consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that
combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking
accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance
remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the
robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance
consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a
scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.

Abstract: We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven
advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the
Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of
traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for
student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI)
and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts,
course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a
locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course
recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual
advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on
25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore,
PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across
different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields
substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes,
confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized
academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can
enhance academic planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育场景中缺乏针对LLMs的评估指标，且现有基准主要测试通用智能而非教学能力。

Method: ELMES采用模块化架构和混合评估引擎，通过LLM-as-a-Judge方法量化教学指标。

Result: 在四个教育场景中测试了LLMs，展示了模型在不同情境下的能力分布。

Conclusion: ELMES为教育者和研究者提供了低门槛的评估工具，推动了LLMs在教育中的实际应用。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Motivation: 传统果树修剪劳动密集且效率低，需要自动化解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了机器人修剪的潜力，但性能仍需提升。

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

Motivation: 农业环境中需要机器人能够高效导航，同时减少土壤和植被的损害。

Method: 使用DTSP进行全局路径规划，生成最短且满足曲率约束的路径；NMPC用于局部路径规划和控制。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法路径更平滑、更短，比解耦方法减少约16%的路径长度。

Conclusion: 该框架在农业环境中具有高效自主导航的潜力。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

Conclusion: 人类操作数据可作为学习双手机器人操作策略的强大基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

Conclusion: 未来研究应结合语言模型与传统规划器，以提高机器人规划的可靠性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: 信息瓶颈资产定价模型结合了深度网络的非线性建模能力，同时避免了噪声干扰，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial
asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear
relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to
over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior
performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset
pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate
redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.
Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear
mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information
between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the
mutual information between the compressed representation and the output
prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is
essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of
financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By
leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only
harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the
intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise
information is filtered out during the information compression process.

Conclusion: AI生成先验与伴随方法结合，通过自动微分实现了鲁棒、高保真的空气动力学形状优化。

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that
integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth
manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an
equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is
the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and
lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first
computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design
parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through
the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our
framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing
adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on
extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and
general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter
tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and
optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to
conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors
integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity
aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh有效解决了自回归模型的高延迟问题，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

Motivation: 现有BWGD算法在恢复高秩矩阵时仅能证明局部线性收敛，且算法不稳定。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持快速收敛的同时具有更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: 平滑框架成功解决了BWGD的不稳定性问题，并提供了严格的超线性收敛保证。

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

Motivation: ITR在精准医学、拼车和广告推荐等领域应用广泛，但受敏感属性（如种族、性别、年龄）影响时可能导致不公平结果。

Method: 基于最优传输理论，提出改进的权衡ITR，通过参数调整平衡价值与公平性，并引入平滑公平约束以最大化特定公平水平下的价值。

Result: 通过模拟研究和Next 36创业计划数据集验证了方法的性能，并建立了改进权衡ITR价值损失的理论上限。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ITR中的公平性问题，同时通过改进的权衡ITR实现了价值与公平的平衡。

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.
